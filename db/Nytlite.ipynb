But they have absolutely no intention of repeating their mistakes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whatever they were, exactly.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Was it the loss of working-class white voters or urban black voters? Too much talk of Donald J. Trump or not enough? And what about those Russians?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If Hillary Clinton’s decision to skip campaigning in Wisconsin was a problem, the party has that one covered. Democrats selected Milwaukee as the site of their national convention a year from now.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Michigan and Pennsylvania, states where Hillary Clinton lost after polling ahead for months, Democratic candidates pop up at coffee shops and farmers’ markets, field questions from audiences in packed high school auditoriums and clog up cellphone voice mail boxes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You’re making me confess to a secret,” said Representative Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, a liberal who represents the area around Madison. He explained that his voice mail was full and no one could leave new messages. It’s been that way since the beginning of the year, and he said has no plans to clear it out. “That way I don’t have to deal with the candidates,” he said. “We have a few calling, obviously.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics?smid=rd%3Faction%3Dclick&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics?smid=rd?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article\" title=\"\">Sign up for our politics newsletter</a></a> <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">From former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who kicked off his 2020 campaign in a Pittsburgh union hall, to Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s effort to energize her campaign with a Rust Belt bus tour last week, the presidential candidates are eager to show Democratic voters, officials and activists that they’re fighting the next war — by way of the last one.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania have become an electoral Bermuda triangle for Democrats, with a pull so strong that they’re frequently mentioned at campaign events in Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters will set the course for the 2020 primary race.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’ve got to put someone at the top of the ticket who can win in places like Iowa and Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania, right? We all know that,” Senator Amy Klobuchar told voters during a Saturday campaign stop in Waterloo, Iowa.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two days later Mr. Biden said his candidacy relies on winning the same set of states.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m accustomed to winning places like Pennsylvania and Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin,” he told 200 people gathered on the driveway at the home of former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa. “There’s no way a Democrat can get elected president without winning Pennsylvania, you just can’t do it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Rust Belt bus tours and campaign cattle calls are far more about lingering post-traumatic stress from the Democrats’ 2016 loss than any current electoral strategy. While the traditionally blue states are likely to be crucial to Democrats in a general election, none of the three are scheduled to hold their primary vote before Super Tuesday, the dozen-state primary that’s widely expected to winnow the field in early March.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Of course, the 2020 race bears little resemblance to the last race — or any other primary in modern electoral history. The crowded Democratic field is four times as big as it was at its largest point in 2016, historically diverse and features the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/09/us/politics/2020-democractic-candidates-ages.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">widest age gap ever seen in a primary contest</a>. Democrats may have new opportunities in states where demographics are shifting like Georgia, Arizona and Texas. And the nominee will face a sitting president, who has shown some eagerness to intervene in the opposing party primary contest.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[President Trump’s re-election strategy </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/trump-election-squad.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">involves stoking cultural and racial resentments</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">, just as he did in 2016.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The field of 2020 candidates is eager to reassure voters that if they win, they won’t take anything for granted, even as they handle the previous Democratic nominee with extreme care. Earlier this year, Ms. Klobuchar <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/hillary-clinton-2020-democratic-candidates.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">quickly called Mrs. Clinton to apologize</a>, after she launched her bid with promises to win in Wisconsin that were seen as a jab at the former Secretary of State.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, the implicit critique rings clear to Democratic voters and donors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was one of Hillary Clinton’s finance chairs and unfortunately she didn’t come into Michigan enough. They’re not ignoring us now,” said Barry Goodman, a Democratic donor in the Detroit suburbs who is raising money for Mr. Biden.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In town hall meetings and diner meet-and-greets, Democrats frequently bring up the 2016 defeat, often as an origin story for how they became more engaged in national politics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“People continue to come up to me to tell me the story of where they were on the evening of Nov. 8, 2016, how it impacted them, how they’ve since become engaged,” said Representative Chrissy Houlahan, a freshman from the Philadelphia suburbs who’s being wooed by multiple presidential candidates for an endorsement. “It’s seared in the collective memory.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For others, the shock of that loss transformed them into cable news pundits, eager to project what white Rust Belt voters may — or may not — want in a candidate over what they personally might prefer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have created an electorate full of pundits and strategists, and the result is that we’re puzzling through not who we like but who we imagine someone else will like,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. “It’s a fool’s errand to imagine who will be appealing to someone else.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The armchair punditry is only exacerbated by a steady drumbeat of polling on the race. After a period of soul searching, pollsters are once again up and running.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A 2017 report by the American Association for Public Opinion Research, an industry group, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000015b-d46e-da30-a3db-fefe45b50002\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">recommended some changes</a> to polling, notably improving accounting for voters’ education levels, surveying people closer to Election Day and pressing those who say they are undecided on which way they might be leaning. But mostly, the report blamed the “large, problematic errors” in state polls on a single culprit: Money.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is a persistent frustration within polling and the larger survey research community that the profession is judged based on how these often under-budgeted state polls perform relative to the election outcome,” the report noted.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Charles Franklin, the director of the Marquette Law School poll in Milwaukee, who helped craft the report, says while it identified some problems and suggested solutions, none were a “magic bullet.” He’s back in business for the 2020 election, with some tweaks to how he surveys voters who say they’re undecided.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“At least, we have to be self-aware of what we are doing,” he said. “You look at all your data and everything you do and you make some adjustments, but in the end you have to trust your data, recognizing that the data can be wrong.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That’s certainly a lesson President Trump remembers. His campaign is trying to recapture the magic by running on the same message of cracking down on immigration, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/trump-election-squad.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">race-baiting</a> and skepticism toward conventional political wisdom — starting with ignoring what he calls “phony polling.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m going to do it the same way I did it the first time,” he said in an interview with ABC News last month.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Democrats remain far more divided over what lessons their party should draw from the last race.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There’s something fundamental about the fact that Trump presented himself as a noxious human and still won that is disconcerting and unsettling about America,” said Adam Jentleson, a Democratic strategist working for a group focused on suing Mr. Trump. “But the why, we don’t know. It depends who you talk to.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Senator Elizabeth Warren rarely mentions Mr. Trump in her stump speech, focusing instead on her plans for transforming the country’s economy. Mr. Biden takes nearly the exact opposite tack, weaving his opposition to the current president into nearly all parts of his argument. His supporters argue that the race will be won by convincing moderates that the Democratic nominee is a safer choice than Mr. Trump.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’ve got to get moderate working-class Democrats back,” said former Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, who’s backing Mr. Biden. “We’ve got to get candidates that they can relate to.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Senator Kamala Harris, meanwhile, argues that the path to victory for Democrats runs through energizing the women, people of color, and younger voters that make up the backbone of the party.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Her campaign, along with others in the party, believes that mobilizing these voters in cities like Detroit, Milwaukee and Philadelphia could make the difference in the three states in question.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There are things we all understand about what happened in 2016 aside from Russian interference,” said Adrianne Shropshire, who runs BlackPAC, an African-American political organizing group. “What is clear is that there were key segments of the Democratic base that stayed home.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Others think that Democrats should spend less time and money in traditional swing states like Ohio and Iowa and instead focus on <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/us/politics/democrats-2020-midwest-voters.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">shifting their map into the rapidly changing Sun Belt</a>, where they found success during the 2018 midterms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">All the uncertainty has left some Democrats urging voters to take a truly radical stance: Just vote for who you believe in.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Put your money on someone who energizes and excites you,” said Mr. Jentleson, “rather than someone who appeals to a voter in a diner in rural Michigan who you invited in your head.”</p>',\n",

Like many affluent school districts at the time, Broward was considering laptops and wireless networks for its classrooms and 250,000 students. Were there any health risks to worry about?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The district asked <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180603033545/http:/www.emscitek.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Bill P.

The slope was gentle at first, but when the line reached the wireless frequencies associated with computer networking, it shot straight up, indicating a dangerous level of exposure.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This graph shows why I am concerned,” Dr. Curry wrote.

In 1978, Paul Brodeur, an investigative journalist, published “The Zapping of America,” which drew on suggestive but often ambiguous evidence <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/28/archives/books-of-the-times-microwaves-and-men-a-benign-river-interest.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">to argue</a> that the <!-- -->growing use of high frequencies<!-- --> could endanger human health.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In contrast, Dr. Curry’s voice was authoritative. <!-- -->He became a private consultant in the 1990s after <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/199912/letters.cfm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">federal budget cuts</a> brought <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8059724\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">his research career</a> to an end. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180603033545/http:/www.emscitek.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">He had degrees</a> in physics (1959 and 1965) and electrical engineering (1990).<!-- --> His credentials and decades of experience <!-- -->at federal and industrial laboratories<!-- -->, including the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, seemed to make him a very strong candidate to conduct the Broward study.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He was a very bright guy,” recalled Gary Brown, an expert in the district’s technology unit who worked with Dr. Curry to prepare the reports.

He warned that children were especially vulnerable to the cancer risk of wireless technology. “Their brains are developing,” he noted in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.stayonthetruth.com/resources/Curry%20letter%20re%20Wireless%20in%20school%20room.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">his first report</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Curry belonged to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://cyrusfarivar.com/docs/WiFi%20Health/about_us.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a national group of wireless critics</a>, and his two reports for the Broward district soon began <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://chej.org/wp-content/uploads/Cell-Phone-Towers-PUB-129.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">to circulate widely</a> among industry foes. One reached Dr. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/8212.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">David O. Carpenter</a>, who for decades had clashed with the science establishment on the health risks of radio waves.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Carpenter’s credentials were impressive. He graduated magna cum laude<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em>from Harvard in 1959 and cum laude from its medical school in<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em>1964. From 1985 to 1997, he served as dean of the School of Public Health at the State University of New York in Albany, and in 2001 became director of its Institute for Health and the Environment, where he still works. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/testimony-of-dr-david-carpenter-with-exhibits.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">His resumé</a> <!-- -->list<!-- -->s hundreds of journal reports, jobs, grants, awards, advisory boards, books and legal declarations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Carpenter stirred global controversy in the 1980s by asserting that high-voltage power lines could cause leukemia in nearby children. <!-- -->He appeared as an authority in Mr. Brodeur’s 1989 book, “Currents of Death.” But federal researchers <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/health/long-after-an-80s-scare-suspicion-of-power-lines-prevails.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">failed to find solid evidence</a> to support the warnings.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In late 2011, Dr. Carpenter introduced Dr. Curry’s graph in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/07/wi-fi_lawsuit_against_portland.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a lawsuit</a> that sought to force the Portland, Ore., public schools to abandon their wireless computer networks. The suit had been filed by a worried parent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As an expert witness, Dr. Carpenter said in a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.wirelesswatchblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2001/11/Amended-Declaration-of-Dr-David-Carpenter.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">legal declaration</a> on Dec. 20, 2011, that the graph showed how the brain’s absorption of radio-wave energy “increases exponentially” as wireless frequencies rise, calling it evidence of grave student danger. The graph “illustrates the problem with the drive of the wireless industry toward ever higher frequencies,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In response to such arguments, the industry noted that it obeys government safety rules. The judge in the Portland case said the court had no jurisdiction over federal regulatory matters, and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/07/wi-fi_lawsuit_against_portland.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">dismissed the lawsuit</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Despite the setback, Dr. Carpenter’s 2011 declaration, which included Dr. Curry’s graph, kept drawing attention. In 2012, he introduced it as part of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/testimony-of-dr-david-carpenter-with-exhibits.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">his testimony</a> to a Michigan state board assessing wireless dangers, and <!-- -->it<!-- --> soon <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.wirelesswatchblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2001/11/Amended-Declaration-of-Dr-David-Carpenter.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">began circulating</a> online among <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.wirelesswatchblog.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">wireless critics</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And he saw a new danger. Between 2010 and 2012, the frequencies of the newest generation of cellphones, 4G, rose past those typical of the day’s wireless networks. Dr. Carpenter now had a much larger and seemingly more urgent target, especially since cellphones were often held snugly against the head.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There is now much more evidence of risks to health, affecting billions of people,” <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://bioinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/BioInitiativePressRelease1-1-2013.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">he said</a> in introducing a 1,400-page report on wireless dangers that he edited <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://harpers.org/archive/2010/05/for-whom-the-cell-tolls/8/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">with an aide</a>. “The status quo is not acceptable.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://bioinitiative.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">BioInitiative Report</a>, released in late 2012, gained worldwide notice. But mainstream science rejected its <!-- -->conclusions<!-- -->. Two Oxford University researchers <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cdev.13013\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">described it</a> as “scientifically discredited.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Unbowed, Dr. Carpenter worked hard to revise established science. In 2012, he became editor in chief of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/reveh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Reviews on Environmental Health</a>, a quarterly journal.

Instead, it came to be regarded by activists as an established fact of <!-- -->modern science<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The higher the frequency, the more dangerous,” according to Radiation Health Risks, a website, in reference to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.radiationhealthrisks.com/5g-cell-towers-dangerous/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">signals from 5G towers.</a> The idea was echoed by a similar website, 5G Exposed — “Higher frequencies are more dangerous to health” — <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.5gexposed.com/2018/07/30/scientific-discussion-about-the-dangers-of-microwaves/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">on a page</a> entitled “Scientific Discussion.” Over all, the site bristled with brain-cancer warnings.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Recently, Dr. Carpenter<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmLwuM0_MJg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> told RT America</a>, a Russian television network, that the newest cellphones represented a dire health threat. “The rollout of 5G is very frightening,” he said. “Nobody is going to be able to escape the radiation.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In recent months, the network has run a series of segments critical of 5G technology. “The higher the frequency, the more dangerous it is to living organisms,” a RT reporter <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpXEyP0WMrk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">told viewers</a> in March<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">. </strong>The show described children as particularly vulnerable.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new cellphones are to employ a range of radio frequencies up to dozens of times higher than those Dr. Curry identified two decades ago as endangering student health. But mainstream scientists continue to see no evidence of harm from cellphone radio waves. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If phones are linked to cancer, we’d expect to see a marked uptick,” David Robert Grimes, a cancer researcher at the University of Oxford, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/21/mobile-phones-are-not-a-health-hazard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">wrote recently</a> in The Guardian. “Yet we do not.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a recent interview, Dr. Carpenter defended his high-frequency view. “You have all this evidence that cellphone radiation penetrates the brain,” he said. But he conceded after some discussion that the increasingly high frequencies could in fact have a difficult time entering the human body: “There’s some legitimacy to that point of view.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He noted that, in cities, 5G service requires the placement of many antenna towers, because walls, buildings, rain, leaves and other objects can block the high-frequency signals. “That’s why they put the towers so close together,” he said. “The waves don’t penetrate.” If human skin also blocks 5G signals, Dr. Carpenter acknowledged, “maybe it’s not that big a deal.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Curry, now 82, was less forthcoming. In an interview, he said he no longer follows the wireless industry and disavowed any knowledge of having made a scientific error.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They can say whatever they want,” Dr. Curry said of his detractors. “I’ll leave it to the young in the business and let them figure it out.”</p>',\n",

Disney, who founded the entertainment company in 1923 with his brother Walt, appeared on the Yahoo News video series “Through Her Eyes” this week. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/i-was-so-livid-disney-heiress-visits-theme-park-undercover-to-see-worker-conditions-093000722.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">The interview</a> touched on a range of sensitive topics — her archly conservative parents were, at times, abusive alcoholics, she said — but her comments about wages for Disneyland workers in California were widely picked up online.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I went to Anaheim, and I wanted to be sure I understood the situation and the context really, really well,” Ms. Disney said. “Every single one of these people I talked to were saying, ‘I don’t know how I can maintain this face of joy and warmth when I have to go home and forage for food in other people’s garbage.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She added, “At a company that has never been more profitable, there is no excuse for any employee to be using food stamps, to be doubling up on housing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Disney, 59, did not say whether she spoke to full- or part-time workers. Her visit occurred sometime last year. For much of 2018, Disneyland was engaged in contract negotiations with five unions that represent its workers. New multiyear deals were<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-disneyland-contract-hotel-workers-20180923-story.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> eventually reached</a> with all of them, with Disney agreeing to increase starting hourly pay to a minimum of $15, from $13.25.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Disney did not respond to an interview request on Wednesday. The Yahoo interviewer, Zainab Salbi, initially described Ms. Disney’s theme park visit as “undercover” but corrected herself on Wednesday in a Twitter post. “For the record, she NEVER said she went ‘undercover’ to Anaheim,” Ms. Salbi wrote.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The company said in a lengthy statement that it rejected Ms. Disney’s comments as “baseless” and “egregious.” It called her claims a “stunt” and “an insult to the thousands of employees who are part of the Disney community.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Disney noted that hourly workers at its theme parks in California and Florida earn an average of $19.50 an hour, well above the federal minimum wage. “But we understand the challenges workers and families face in 2019 are complex and go beyond the paycheck,” the company said. “That’s why we provide a wide range of benefits and initiatives to improve our employees’ lives at and outside of work: from subsidized child care to generous leave policies, from convenient access to pharmacies and clinics to free college degrees and vocational training programs for hourly employees.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Disney family has not been involved in managing the company since Roy E. Disney, Ms. Disney’s father, stepped down from the board in 2003. He subsequently led a shareholder revolt that resulted in Michael D. Eisner’s resignation as chief executive and Robert A. Iger’s ascendance to the top of the company. Roy E. Disney <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/arts/television/17disney.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">died in 2009</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Disney is the director of a 2014 documentary, “The Armor of Light,” that follows an anti-abortion activist and a supporter of abortion rights. She has recently started to work on a possible documentary about income inequality.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She is also a founder of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/killer-content-abigail-disney-level-forward-studio-1202664003/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Level Forward</a>, a start-up that backs media projects — films, stage shows, podcasts — driven by women and people of color.</p>',\n",

       " 'adidas-diversity-employees': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the United States, Adidas has built much of its name — and sales — through its association with black superstars. In the 1980s, the seminal hip-hop group Run-DMC gave the company’s sneakers and apparel cultural cachet through its song “My Adidas.” Popular black athletes and entertainers like James Harden, Candace Parker and Kanye West endorse its products.<br/></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In April, Adidas announced <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/style/beyonce-adidas-collaboration.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a new partnership</a> with Beyoncé Knowles. Ms. Knowles posted a photo on <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwuX3GJBYyI/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Beyonce\\'s Instagram Feed\">Instagram</a> that showed her reclining on a pile of Adidas sneakers and wearing a red Adidas bodysuit. The image was liked more than seven million times.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Black employees at the company’s North American headquarters in Portland, Ore., however, describe a workplace culture that contradicts the brand’s image. Interviews with more than 20 current or former Adidas employees show the company’s predominantly white leadership struggling with issues of race and discrimination. On the campus, known as Adidas Village, the employees say, race is a constant issue, leaving the relatively few black employees often feeling marginalized and sometimes discriminated against.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Of the nearly 1,700 Adidas employees at the Portland campus, fewer than 4.5 percent identify as black, according to internal employment figures from last summer that were shared with The New York Times.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Adidas employees who spoke to The Times said that in the company cafeteria, black employees often sit together. Some said they had been told that this made some of their white colleagues nervous and could hurt their chances of getting promotions or being put on important marketing campaigns if it appeared that they were not trying to fit the Adidas mold.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Several current and former Adidas employees said they were frequently the only black person in meetings and often felt their input was not valued when decisions were being made. And an overall lack of racial diversity, they said, meant it was not uncommon for negative stereotypes to creep into work discussions or marketing pitches involving black athletes, sometimes creating backlash outside the company. Even when such ideas were scuttled before becoming part of official advertising campaigns, black employees said, the conversations left them feeling uncomfortable.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For many, the internal tensions at Adidas reflect a larger issue facing the American sports apparel industry, which has a combined annual revenue of more than $20 billion on shoe sales alone. Companies like Adidas, Nike and Under Armour have work forces that are primarily white, but their most influential customers — those who make their products desirable to others — often are not.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At Adidas, the issues involving race are not limited to business, black employees said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two black employees said they had been referred to with a common racist slur by white co-workers, one verbally and one in a text message seen by The Times. In both instances, the people believed the slur was intended as a joke, which they felt only highlighted the company’s skewed perspective on race.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">All of the current and former employees spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared hurting their careers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Karen Parkin, the global head of human resources for Adidas, said in an interview that the company knew that it had work to do on the issue of race.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Parkin said Adidas had “zero tolerance” for inappropriate behavior. She said that she was unaware of the incidents involving the slurs and that, if they had been reported to human resources, an investigation would have occurred.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We want to be humble,” Ms. Parkin said. “We’re not where we need to be in all of the locations around the world. But we’re not afraid to have the conversation, either.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For Adidas, the ties to black stars have paid off. The company’s stock, which trades in Germany, where its global headquarters are, has more than doubled in the last three years. Its revenue has been growing robustly, and its share of the North American sports-footwear market has jumped to 11 percent from 4 percent since 2015, according to the market research company NPD Group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the case of Mr. West, Adidas positioned his Yeezy brand as its own category inside the company. Mr. West earns 5 percent royalties on net sales of his shoes and apparel, according to a person inside the company with knowledge of the relationship. Yeezy sales are expected to top $1.3 billion this year. A spokeswoman for Mr. West declined to comment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The benefits from the collaboration extend beyond selling $350 high-top shoes and high-end designer apparel. Almost overnight, Mr. West helped to make Adidas cool again.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The association with Kanye West and how he sees himself as an artist — with design, music and culture — said this Adidas brand is not just a typical sports brand,” Mark King, then the head of Adidas North America, said in an interview with the trade publication Footwear News in 2016. “It’s one that looks at creativity and considers both sports and culture.” (Mr. King stepped down from his role in 2018.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After Mr. West made his Adidas deal, other hip-hop stars like Pusha T established relationships with the company. Pharrell Williams, who was already working with Adidas, signed a new deal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think Adidas is trying to align itself with the fans of those artists,” said Matt Powell, an analyst with NPD Group. “These artists have tremendous followings and fans. Those fans want to dress like their idols.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is much different inside the company. Fewer than 75 of the nearly 1,700 Adidas employees in Portland identify as black, according to the internal employment figures from last summer. Nearly 78 percent of the employees are white.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An Adidas spokeswoman, Stacey Marsh, did not dispute the figures obtained by The Times, and declined to comment on the composition of the staff at the company’s Portland headquarters. She said that 55 percent of the company’s total employee base in the United States, which includes employees paid hourly wages in its retail stores, were people of color.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Only three people, or about 1 percent, of Adidas’s roughly 340 worldwide vice presidents last year were black, according to two people with knowledge of the figures. One of the black executives, a female head of operations, has since departed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Marsh said that Adidas could not provide information on the race or ethnicity of its employees at a global level because of country-specific laws.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The employee figures for other sports apparel giants are similarly stark. Last year, when Footwear News <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://footwearnews.com/2018/business/retail/40-under-40-shoe-young-executives-retailers-1202556866/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">highlighted</a> the top 40 people under 40 who it said were revolutionizing the shoe industry, the list did not include a single black person.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nike says that at the end of 2017, about 23 percent of its American employees, including those working at its retail stores, were black. Of the company’s 353 vice presidents, 29, or 8 percent, were black.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Under Armour’s website lists its goals related to diversity and inclusion, but the company declined to provide data on the makeup of its work force for this article.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Companies spend billions of dollars on marketing and advertising to attract African-American kids to their products, but they don’t do much to support the African-Americans on the inside,” said D’Wayne Edwards, who started designing shoes in 1989 and worked at Nike, where he designed Air Jordan shoes. He now runs Pensole Footwear Design Academy in Portland.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What is frustrating is that none of us are empowered to change it,” he added. “Some companies have said for years that they want to create a diverse workplace, but if anything, the numbers are getting worse. And they don’t care. It’s a lot of lip service.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The lack of diversity at Adidas has resulted in missteps that black employees argue could put the entire brand at risk.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This year, Adidas released all-white sneakers as part of a line meant to commemorate Black History Month. It <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/business/gucci-blackface-adidas-apologize.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">removed the sneakers</a> from stores after an outcry.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2012, Adidas released a pair of $350 sneakers featuring shackles. After the company faced boycott calls led by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the sneakers were <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/fashion/adidas-cancels-release-of-shackle-sneakers.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">pulled</a> and Adidas apologized for offending consumers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At other times, it has fallen to black employees to stop insensitive marketing ideas before they were carried out.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2016, there was a meeting about the company’s latest sneaker for Mr. Harden, the Houston Rockets star. One idea was to make the shoe part of the company’s “uncaged” line. The ads for “Harden Uncaged,” the thinking went, could feature Mr. Harden breaking free from a prison cell.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When someone raised the question of whether such an image would invoke a negative racial stereotype, the proposal was rejected, according to three people who were at the meeting or aware of the idea and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The shoe was eventually marketed as Harden LS, for lifestyle.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another idea, titled “All Rise,” featured Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers as a defendant in a courtroom, according to an employee involved in the discussion. Again, it was scuttled when a black employee pointed out the racial overtones of a black man’s being put on trial.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When asked about these instances, Ms. Marsh, the Adidas spokeswoman, said the company would not comment on “every anonymous rumor or allegation.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At a town hall-style staff meeting at the Portland campus in spring 2018, Zion Armstrong, the current president of Adidas North America, acknowledged that the company needed to intensify its diversity efforts, according to three people who were there.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Months later, with no visible change in the company’s hiring efforts, an anonymous letter addressed to Mr. Armstrong and critical of Adidas’s strategies for becoming more diverse made its way <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://footwearnews.com/2018/focus/athletic-outdoor/adidas-black-minority-employees-diversity-1202705284/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">around the campus.</a> It was reported at the time by Footwear News.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A few weeks later, Mr. Armstrong attended a meeting of Progressive Soles, an employee-led organization within Adidas whose members are mostly minorities, and seemingly contradicted his earlier comments.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He declared that Adidas did not have a race problem, according to two people in attendance. Instead, he said, the company’s demographics reflected those of Portland, which is 77 percent white and 6 percent black, according to 2017 Census Bureau statistics. When asked why more black employees were not being promoted, Mr. Armstrong said there simply were not any who were ready.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Adidas declined to make Mr. Armstrong available for an interview and did not respond to questions about his meeting with Progressive Soles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Several current and former Adidas employees said that minority employees often left the company in hopes of getting better jobs or higher pay after not receiving promotions they believed they deserved.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A few years ago, when some black employees recognized that there were not many black candidates going through the company’s internship program, Progressive Soles began recruiting efforts outside the Portland area to attract a more diverse pool of applicants. But few of those internships have led to job offers for the black candidates, several people at the company said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Parkin noted that Portland “isn’t the most diverse city in the U.S.,” and said that Adidas “needs to be more courageous and bold” in attracting more diverse employees to the area.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re on that journey right now,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some artists are not simply taking the company’s word.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Late last year, shortly before the internal letter to Mr. Armstrong became public, Pharrell Williams went to Portland to see Adidas Village for himself, according to two employees. He walked around the campus, visiting with various groups, including those in the basketball division, that he does not normally work with, the employees said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Williams declined to comment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/intimates/pharrell-williams-adidas-nmd-human-project-10565164/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">2016 interview with Women’s Wear Daily</a>, Mr. Williams said that one of his apparel and sneaker lines for Adidas called Hu — short for human — was about the “recognition and celebration of different colors, spirituality and cultures.” But last year, Mr. Williams and Adidas were criticized after the release of the “Hu Holi Powder Dye Collection.” Some said they had appropriated aspects of the Holi Festival, an annual Hindu tradition.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During his visit to the Adidas campus, Mr. Williams met with Mr. Armstrong to discuss inclusivity and sat down with members of Progressive Soles. There, he spoke candidly about his upbringing and why he had signed with Adidas, according to a person who was at the meeting. Then he indicated his desire to use his star power to push Adidas toward greater diversity.</p>',\n",

Don’t worry — we’re here to catch you up.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At least, not yet. While Amazon increasingly relies on machines to pluck products from shelves, box them up and ship them to your doorstep, that doesn’t mean the humans who now do those things are out of a job. The company <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/technology/amazon-workers-retraining-automation.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">announced an ambitious, $700 million retraining program</a> for a third of its employees in the United States (about 100,000 people), all in the name of adapting to the changing role of workers as automated technology continues to do more of the heavy lifting. In related news, Prime Day — Amazon’s annual sale for Prime members — will span 48 hours this year, from Monday to Tuesday, and has spawned competing discounts at stores like Target and Walmart. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">President Trump <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/business/trump-social-media-summit.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">gathered his loudest online supporters</a> for a social media summit at the White House on Thursday. Not on the guest list: leaders from the social media platforms themselves, like Twitter and Facebook, which Mr. Trump and many right-wing internet personalities have accused of having an anti-conservative bias. Several political extremists were barred from Facebook, Instagram and YouTube this year for promoting hateful ideologies, and Twitter <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/technology/twitter-ban-speech-dehumanizing.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">rolled out new rules against “dehumanizing speech”</a> on Tuesday.

It’s the first tax of its kind, but other European countries <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/business/economy/tech-company-taxes.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">may soon follow suit</a>. It’s also a shot across the bow at the White House, which has claimed that the tax discriminates against American companies. The Trump administration <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/business/us-france-tariffs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">warned France that it would fight</a> the new measure — possibly with its favorite weapon: tariffs. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The money manager Jeffrey Epstein was once considered so rich and powerful that he managed to sidestep federal charges when he pleaded guilty to a state prostitution charges in 2008. Now he’s <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/06/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-arrested-sex-trafficking.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">facing sex-trafficking charges</a> in New York (where he owns <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a $77 million mansion</a>), and the leniency of his previous sentence has been called into question. Wrapped up in the furor is Alexander Acosta, who said Friday that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/acosta-resigns-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">he would resign</a> as labor secretary after an uproar over the plea deal he struck with Mr. Epstein more than 10 years ago, when he was a prosecutor in Miami.

It would be the first rate cut since the recession hit over a decade ago. The stock market rejoiced at the prospect, but some critics believe it’s premature, given that the United States economy is still <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/business/economy/minority-women-hispanics-jobs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">motoring along at a record-breaking pace</a>.

Britain’s new prime minister will be announced on July 23, when Parliament tallies the results of a runoff vote. Mr. Hunt and Mr. Johnson have been in a monthslong face-off in the Conservative Party to succeed Theresa May, who said she would step down after failing to secure an agreement to ferry Britain through its withdrawal from the European Union.

The bacterial infection, transmitted by a tiny winged insect from China, has evaded all efforts to contain it, decimating Florida’s citrus industry and forcing scores of growers out of business.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a last-ditch attempt to slow the infection, Mr. Petteway revved up his industrial sprayer one recent afternoon and doused the trees with a novel pesticide: antibiotics used to treat syphilis, tuberculosis, urinary tract infections and a number of other illnesses in humans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These bactericides give us hope,” said Mr. Petteway’s son, R.

The desperation is palpable across the state’s sandy midsection, a flat expanse once lushly blanketed with citrus trees, most of them the juice oranges that underpin a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://fred.ifas.ufl.edu/economicimpactanalysis/publications/2016-2017CitrusIndustry/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">$7.2 billion industry</a> employing 50,000 people, about 40,000 fewer than it did two decades ago.

The agency has also proposed the expanded use of streptomycin under similar terms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The decision paves the way for the largest use of medically important antibiotics in cash crops, and it runs counter to other efforts by the federal government to reduce the use of lifesaving antimicrobial drugs. Since 2017, the F.D.A. has banned the use of antibiotics to promote growth in farm animals, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/fda-reports-major-drop-antibiotics-food-animals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a </a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/fda-reports-major-drop-antibiotics-food-animals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">shift that has led to a 33 percent drop in sales of antibiotics for livestock.</a></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The use of antibiotics on citrus adds a wrinkle to an intensifying debate about whether the heavy use of antimicrobials in agriculture endangers human health by neutering the drugs’ germ-slaying abilities. Much of that debate has focused on livestock farmers, who use 80 percent of antibiotics sold in the United States. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although the research on antibiotic use in crops is not as extensive, scientists say the same dynamic is already playing out with the fungicides that are liberally sprayed on vegetables and flowers across the world. Researchers believe the surge in a drug-resistant lung infection called aspergillosis is associated with agricultural fungicides, and many suspect the drugs are behind the rise of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Candida auris</a>, a deadly fungal infection.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Drug-resistant infections kill 23,000 Americans each year and sicken two million, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">according to the C.D.C.</a> As more germs mutate, the threat is growing. With few new medicines in the pipeline, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/health/un-drug-resistance-antibiotics.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">United Nations</a> says resistant infections could claim 10 million lives globally by 2050, exceeding deaths from cancer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Antibiotics sprayed on crops can affect farm workers or people who directly consume contaminated fruit, but scientists are especially worried that the drugs will cause <!-- -->pathogenic bacteria in the soil to become resistant to the compounds<!-- --> and then find their way to people through groundwater or contaminated food. The other fear is that these bacteria will share their drug-resistant mechanisms with other germs, making them, too, impervious to other kinds of antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In its evaluation for the expanded use of streptomycin, the E.P.A., which largely relied on data from pesticide makers, said the drug quickly dissipated in the environment. Still, the agency noted that there was a “medium” risk from extending the use of such drugs to citrus crops, and it acknowledged the lack of research on whether a massive increase in spraying would affect the bacteria that infect humans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The science of resistance is evolving and there is a high level of uncertainty in how and when resistance occurs,” the agency<!-- --> wrote.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since its arrival in Florida was first confirmed in 2005, citrus greening has infected more than 90 percent of the state’s grapefruit and orange trees. The pathogen is spread by a tiny insect, the Asian citrus psyllid, that infects trees as it feeds on young leaves and stems, but the evidence of disease can take months to emerge. Infected trees prematurely drop their fruit, most of it too bitter for commercial use.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Officials say it is too early to know how many farmers will embrace the spraying of antibiotics. Interviews with a dozen growers and industry officials suggest many farmers are waiting to see whether the regimen is effective.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The E.P.A. acknowledged that the<!-- --> volume of spraying <!-- -->could soar if the scourge reaches California’s commercial orange groves. More than 1,000 trees in the Los Angeles basin, most of them in residential backyards, have been infected so far this year, a doubling from the same period last year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s just a matter of time,” said James Cranney, president of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://ccqc.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">California Citrus Quality Council</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jim Adaskaveg, a plant pathologist at the University of California, Riverside, who does consulting work for the California citrus council, supports using antibiotics in agriculture. He noted that the government has long approved use of smaller amounts of streptomycin and oxytetracycline to manage a destructive bacterial disease that infects apple and pear crops.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Because the E.P.A. prohibits their application 40 days before harvest, he said there was little chance consumers would ingest the drugs. “We’ve been safely using them for decades,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Taw Richardson, the chief executive of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://agrosource.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">ArgoSource</a>, which makes the antibiotics used by farmers, said the company has yet to see any resistance in the 14 years since it began selling bactericides. “We don’t take antibiotic resistance lightly,” he said. “The key is to target the things that contribute to resistance and not get distracted by things that don’t.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many scientists disagree with such assessments, noting the mounting resistance to both drugs in humans. They also cite <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180423085415.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">studies</a> suggesting that low concentrations of antibiotics that slowly seep into the environment over an extended period of time can significantly accelerate resistance. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Scientists at the C.D.C. were especially concerned about streptomycin, which can remain in the soil for weeks and is allowed to be sprayed several times a season. As part of its consultation with the F.D.A., the C.D.C. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/pesticides_reduction/pdfs/CDC-study-from-FOIA.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">conducted experiments</a> with the two drugs and found widespread resistance to them. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although the Trump administration has been pressing the E.P.A. to loosen regulations, Nathan Donley, a senior scientist at the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Center for Biological Diversity</a>, said the agency’s pesticides office had a long track record of favoring the interests of chemical and pesticide companies. “What’s in the industry’s best interest will win out over public safety nine times out of 10,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A spokesman for the E.P.A. said the agency had sought to address the C.D.C.’s and F.D.A.’s concerns about antibiotic resistance by ordering additional monitoring and by limiting its approvals to seven years. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, it remains unclear whether the drugs even work on crops. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://microcell.ufl.edu/people/faculty-directory/lorca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Graciela Lorca</a>, a molecular biologist at the University of Florida and an expert on citrus greening, said she is not convinced. In the absence of peer-reviewed studies, she and other researchers have largely relied on anecdotal evidence from growers who have reported some improvement after applying the drugs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Right now it’s a desperate measure for sure,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One recent afternoon, Kenny Sanders drove through his groves of Valencia and Hamin oranges and pointed out ailing trees adorned with the strips of pink tape that mark them for destruction.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That’s the kiss of death,” Mr. Sanders, a former rodeo performer and cattle rustler, said in a jaunty twang. “Used to be if you had 40 acres, you’d drive a Cadillac and send your kids to college. Not anymore.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said he tried using antibiotics for one season, but gave up after seeing little improvement. Cost, he added, was the main reason <!-- -->he<!-- --> didn’t continue spraying.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the meantime, he and many other growers have embraced a range of remedies: tearing out trees at the first sign of disease and planting new stock bred to better withstand the bacteria. He also regularly feeds his trees a precision blend of micronutrients, a coddling he says helps them withstand the disease.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Roy Petteway does all of the above, too, but he believes that the spraying is worth the expense. Soft-spoken and contemplative, he considers himself a environmentalist and though he worries about antibiotic resistance, he puts his faith in the E.P.A. and its determination that the risks of spraying are minimal. He sees it as a stopgap measure that can help his trees survive until researchers develop disease-resistant stock or more effective treatments.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As a fourth-generation grower, Mr. Petteway has more pressing concerns than the relatively abstract threat of antibiotic resistance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These trees are our livelihood and our future,” he said. “And I’ve got to make sure all of this is here for my children and grandchildren.”</p>',\n",

His article — for the front page of The New York Times on July 21, 1969, needed to begin with a sentence that conveyed the immensity of the moment. And so, after the launch on July 16, but before the landing, he spent a sleepless night trying to come up with an opening sentence, known in the journalism business <!-- -->as a lede:</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is deceptively simple. It has heft. As he recalled in a recent interview: “That word, the ‘moon.’ It was the code word for inaccessible, unreachable.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This opening sentence, he said, put the amazing shift in humanity’s perception of the moon into terms of everyday life that any reader could relate to: “Not only have we reached it, but we walked on it!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We all walk. It is, literally, a pedestrian thing. But this is walking made glorious: “Landed. And walked. On the moon.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This is the story behind that story, which even today can wow a reader with the excitement of the moment: how it was reported and how Mr. Wilford — <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/john-noble-wilford?module=inline\" title=\"\">a giant of science writing</a> and a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/john-noble-wilford\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">two-time</a> <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staff-22\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Pulitzer Prize winner</a> — turned a technically challenging human achievement into a narrative suffused with drama, felicitous language and even humor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The lede — the word is an artifact of the days of Linotype machines, and is used to distinguish the leading sentence of an article from the metal used in those days to form type — was also un-Timesian, especially in 1969. Mr. Wilford had been hired away from Time magazine in 1965 to take on the space beat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The editor who hired him, Harrison Salisbury, told him that The Times did not “want someone to write a science story or a flight story or an engineering story.” He recalls Mr. Salisbury saying that the moon landing should be “a story of a big adventure.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Salisbury was part of a faction of editors who were looking to “put some life into The Times,” Mr. Wilford recalled. But the newsroom was also still filled with “old-fashioned shirt-sleeve editors who went by the old book.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So Mr. Wilford was not just worried about the first <!-- -->eight words of the article<!-- -->. He was also concerned about whether the old guard would require him to come up with something more stuffy and clunky.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was deathly afraid they were going to want me to do some kind of old-fashioned, ‘who what when and where’ lede, and I did not want that,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another thing he did not want was “to have ‘historic’ in the lede,” he said. “It’s a lame way to say something is important.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Wilford called his editor at the time in New York, Henry Lieberman, to clear the way for the unconventional line, with its ring of authority, of history, of a new age in human activity. “I told him what I wanted to do and why, and I said, ‘Do you think that’s going to be all right?’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said Mr. Lieberman replied, “Well, I’ll run that by the editors.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I guess that he did, I never heard anymore,” Mr. Wilford added. “I took nothing as a positive answer.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He then went on to the kind of stylistic flourishes he has always been known for, as in his segue into one of Neil Armstrong’s <!-- -->immortal quotes<!-- -->:</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Wilford reported on the launch in Florida, arriving days before with other Times reporters, all working in a rusty trailer that the newspaper maintained at the Kennedy Space Center press site.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He wrote three versions of the article that night for successive editions of The Times. By deadline of the first edition, the astronauts had landed but not exited the lunar module; by the third edition, two astronauts’ boots had touched the gritty soil of the moon. There was no email; to get his article to New York, Mr. Wilford banged it out on a typewriter and then read each word over the phone, making small changes on the fly as he read, to the “recording room,” where transcriptionists quickly typed up pages and passed them to editors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But after writing up the launch in Florida, there was the problem of how to cover the transition of management of the spacecraft to mission control in Houston. For earlier launches, Mr. Wilford often ended up on a late-night flight. This launch was different. So the publisher of The Times, Arthur O. Sulzberger, “let us use his private jet.” After <!-- -->meeting the newspaper’s deadline<!-- -->s, they traveled speedily and in luxury to Houston.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Houston, the setup for reporters was different, but Mr. Wilford still had his desk, his background materials and his yellow pad with notes about what to expect from the mission — elements of the day-by-day flight plan that he could track as things went along.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His preparation for this reporting was extensive; he had even “flown” a simulator of the lunar lander to get a feel for what Armstrong was up against in piloting the spidery craft. Mr. Wilford repeatedly crashed the vehicle.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Wilford’s storytelling switched back and forth in time between the landing and the moon walk, to a congratulatory phone call from President Richard M. Nixon, then back to the details of stepping down to the surface. Then he deftly transitioned to a stirring <!-- -->paean to exploration:</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I started using ‘spacefaring’ even before the lunar landing,” Mr. Wilford said; he was drawn to the word’s historical echoes. “Seafaring, spacefaring — it’s part of the same thrust.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The structure of the article was determined in part by an editorial requirement to get the details of the landing and first steps on the moon, and the call from Mr. Nixon, “before the jump” — that is, within the part of the article that can be read on the front page. And he found space for flashes of dry humor, <!-- -->as well:</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And the <!-- -->astronauts’ banter:</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At mission control’s press area, Mr. Wilford wore earphones to hear the public affairs officer’s commentary, and watched closed-circuit television to see what the spaceship’s cameras were showing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He kept his ears attuned to whenever anything fresh and amusing occurred, such as <!-- -->that exchange<!-- --> between Armstrong and Michael Collins.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you hear a particularly good quote, if you have anything that helps to give some narrative connection to events, you make a quick, scribbly note that no one but me could decipher,” he said. “I didn’t tape the air-to-ground, and you didn’t usually get a transcript of air-to-ground until several hours later.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The most dramatic element of the landing — the need to fly farther than planned to find a safer landing place — was overshadowed at the time, Mr. Wilford recalled, by a series of alarms from the lander’s computers that mission controllers safely disregarded. The search for a landing spot was described in detail at a briefing later in the evening, and he worked it into the article’s <!-- -->chronology of events.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Throughout the piece, Mr. Wilford alternated between lyrical passages and those rich in scientific information and data, framed in ways that could grip the reader. These lines about Armstrong’s <!-- -->heartbeat speak volumes:</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Stephen J. Dubner, co-author of the “Freakonomics” book series, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://freakonomics.com/2009/07/21/when-data-tell-the-story/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">has called this “one of the most elegant little uses of data I can recall seeing in a news article,”</a> adding, “Someday I would like to write two sentences as good as those.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Dubner, join the crowd.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Near the <!-- -->end of the article,<!-- --> Mr. Wilford returned to Mr. Collins, still orbiting the moon as Mr. Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were on the surface.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Wilford recalled that the return to Mr. Collins was an attempt to bring some balance to the distribution of glory, an act of empathy for a man as alone as any human has ever been.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I still think of what Collins must have been thinking,” he said. “He’s up there in orbit. And Armstrong and Aldrin are landing on the moon, walking on the moon, and you think if something happens that they can’t come back, he has no choice. He can’t rescue them. He has to make the flight back on his own. That would have been the hardest thing in the world, I think.”</p>',\n",

The New York Times has been covering the anniversary of the moon landing, looking back at the event’s meaning, and forward to humankind’s next giant leaps in space.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here is a roundup of some of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/apollo-11-moon-landing?module=inline\" title=\"\">our reporting this year on Apollo 11</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The story of Apollo 11 never really gets old, nor does seeing pictures of the amazing scenes that surrounded it. From the astronauts preparing for their mission to the rocket launching to those first bootprints on the moon’s surface, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/science/apollo-11-moon-landing-photos.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">we collected some of our favorite pictures here</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There are other ways of looking back at the moon landing too. Photographers for The Times captured people around New York City who couldn’t take their eyes off the mission’s progress. Experience <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/15/science/moon-landing-watching-vintage-photos.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the interactive collection of pictures here</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Michael Collins is often the forgotten astronaut of Apollo 11, who kept an orbital vigil as Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin touched down on the moon’s surface. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/science/michael-collins-apollo-11.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Read more about his story here</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Other pioneers never made it to orbit. Ed Dwight was to be America’s first black astronaut, a person in whom the stories of the space race and the civil rights movement briefly met. How the effort to integrate America’s space explorers <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/ed-dwight-was-set-to-be-the-first-black-astronaut-heres-why-that-never-happened.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">came up short is told here</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then there is the vanishing history, such as the big hubs in Southern California and on Long Island that built key pieces of the Apollo spacecraft. The sites are gone, but <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/science/apollo-moon-nasa-engineers.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the stories of people who worked in them live on</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/science/apollo-11-mission-control-nasa.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">NASA reopened its restored mission control room in Houston</a>, making a museum piece that is alive, as though the engineers just stepped away briefly.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Finally, John Noble Wilford, a science writer for The Times who covered the moon landing, described how his famous July 21, 1969, news story was written. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/science/apollo-11-john-noble-wilford.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Read it here</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Why do we go to space? It’s a question we haven’t fully answered, even amid this Apollo 11 nostalgia. Dennis Overbye, a scribe of the science department, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/science/apollo-moon-space.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">provides his own answer here</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ken Liu, a science fiction writer, closely examined the messages of good will from world leaders left there by the Apollo 11 astronauts. Read his essay about the difficulty that comes with trying to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/science/apollo-11-goodwill-messages.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">detach our off-world explorations from our conflicts on Earth</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Women were excluded from America’s early astronaut corps, even though it was known at the time that they might outperform men on some measures. Mary Robinette Kowal, a science fiction writer, summarizes <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/science/women-astronauts-nasa.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the history of gender bias in the space program</a>, and highlights errors to learn from as NASA plans to send a woman to the moon in the next decade.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Finally, how has the conspiracy theory that the moon landing was a hoax persisted? It’s not the internet’s fault, but Amanda Hess explores a new generation of conspiracy theorists who have dug into Apollo 11 for the amusement of their audiences. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/science/moon-landing-hoax-conspiracy-theory.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Read it here</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There’s something of a new moon race underway on Earth. But countries like China and India have very different reasons for landing there, as do private companies. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/science/nasa-moon-apollo-artemis.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Read about them here</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But once we go back, staying for any length of time could be difficult. From dust that cuts like glass to moonquakes and meteorite strikes, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/science/apollo-moon-colony-dangers.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">read about the hazards of life on the moon here</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Maintaining humankind’s lunar heritage — including the Apollo landing sites — will present challenges because no earthy laws can protect anything on the moon. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/science/moon-apollo-11-archaeology-preservation.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Read here about the challenges of lunar preservation here</a>.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Zoom in on major moons in our solar system with <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/07/the-atlas-of-moons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">an engrossing National Geographic interactive atlas</a>.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">The Atlantic on how mission control monitored the Apollo 11 astronauts’ vital signs, and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/apollo-11-moon-heart-rates/593971/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">what made Mr. Armstrong’s heartbeat spike</a>.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Get <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/business/immersive-space-suits-history-fashion-and-function/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">up close with 3D models of past and future spacesuits,</a> including Neil Armstrong’s, in this interactive feature from the Washington Post that is especially fun on a smartphone.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">And <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/movies/apollo-11-podcasts-movies-tv.html\" title=\"\">here’s our guide to TV shows, movies and podcasts</a> worth watching and listening to.</p>',\n",

So it is fitting that the early artifacts of the Apollo moon landings, the grandest feat of exploration ever attempted, resemble nothing so much as toys. They are expressions in miniature of giant aspirations, reminders of how engineers play and imagine the future.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Naturally, toy spaceships wouldn’t be complete without little lunar landscapes to place them on, or astronaut dolls to ride in them. But these toys had a serious purpose. For protection against the rigors of high Gs during launch and re-entry, test pilots and astronauts sat on couches that were custom-made to fit their bodies. Lined up, the molds for the couches look for all the world as if the pilots have assumed the position for a spanking.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the time, nobody knew what it would be like to walk in a spacesuit in the trampoline-like low gravity of the moon, or to drive the trackless wastes of lunar grit and boulders. The space age was young, and we were kids with a cosmic gleam in our eyes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">The Times will host “One Giant Leap: The Apollo 11 Moon Landing, 50 Years On” on July 21 at Town Hall in New York City. </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/onegiantleap\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Buy your tickets here</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.

It was absurdly dangerous work with a mortality rate to match. NASA put them in capsules, presented them as Boy Scouts and called them astronauts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then, there were the men of Apollo who planted the American flag on the lunar surface. Astronauts were now explorers in a new way, leaving footprints in untrodden terrain.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The space shuttle program followed, and the face of the American astronaut changed. It was no longer the exclusive domain of military fighter jocks, as scientists and engineers became fused with the public’s idea of who an astronaut was. They now looked more like America — women and men of many races and vocations. They were even construction workers of a sort as they began building the International Space Station, one of the greatest engineering achievements since the Great Pyramids.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So what will it mean to be astronauts tomorrow? They will soon look almost nothing like the men who walked on the moon. NASA’s new lunar program, called Artemis, promises that moonwalkers will not all be men. And American astronauts will not necessarily even wear the “blue meatball” patch with “NASA” embroidered across it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For would-be American space travelers, NASA is no longer the only game in town. The implications transcend the practical and reach deeply into American culture. And as with any job, the more people who do it, the less special it seems. Commercial airline pilots once held a sort of superstar status in the eyes of Americans. Pilots are no less impressive today, but quantity has diminished their prestige.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Similarly, the bravery of anyone willing to leave Earth on a rocket is unquestionable, but the exclusivity of the job will wane — slowly, certainly, but inexorably. Nongovernment employees will soon leave Earth in nongovernment launch systems from nongovernment spaceports.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“To an extent, we are inventing this as we go along,” said Christopher Ferguson, who twice commanded space shuttles as a NASA astronaut.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added, “NASA, other space-faring nations and industry are going to have to come to terms with how non-NASA, noninternational astronauts are brought into the fold.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Ferguson trains from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/science/apollo-11-mission-control-nasa.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston</a>. A recent day for him was typical: five hours in a launch simulation with the mission operations team. He trained alongside Sunita Williams, herself a two-time space flier and veteran of the space station.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Halfway through the session, the two swapped roles, preparing for situations that might arise on an actual mission. The balance of the day was spent planning timeline management when inserting a crew into a rocket, so that when the hatch closes, all the right things are on the inside, and all the right things are on the outside.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The difference between <!-- -->Mr. Ferguson and Ms. Williams<!-- --> is that Mr. Ferguson does not work for NASA. He works for Boeing and will fly on the first crewed mission of Starliner. Boeing and SpaceX are part of Commercial Crew, a NASA-supported program that has tasked American companies with building spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to the space station. NASA has relied on Russia’s space program for launching astronauts since the last shuttle returned to Earth in 2011.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The first crewed launch of Starliner, which will carry Mr. Ferguson, may fly this year and will represent a new era of human spaceflight. Mr. Ferguson is part of a new type of astronaut corps that will work alongside NASA’s crew. If the Trump administration devotes additional funding for Artemis, its five-year program to return astronauts to the moon, it could accelerate the importance of private astronauts such as those at Boeing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Beyond privately paid drivers on rides to the space station, other companies plan to send people to orbit and beyond in the next decade. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin both could soon fly customers on suborbital trips to space.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then there is Axiom Space, a Houston company that intends to begin building a private space station for wealthy space tourists this year. Axiom hopes to launch its first two modules in 2023. Around the same time SpaceX says it will fly Yusaku Maezawa, a Japanese entrepreneur, and artists who are his guests on a private mission around the moon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Would-be space travelers suddenly have options. And depending on whom you ask, they are every bit an astronaut as those who work for NASA.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Who gets to be called an astronaut is a topic that has provoked a number of disputes during the short history of human spaceflight.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Federal Aviation Administration awards astronaut wings to anyone who flies 50 miles above the surface of Earth. NASA, however, has not always been so generous with the title.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There are astronauts — not all of them, but some — who feel that ‘astronaut’ should be a reserved name for government employees,” Lori B. Garver, a former associate administrator of NASA, said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She points to Charles Walker, who flew on three space shuttle missions. His <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/c-walker.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">official NASA biography</a>, however, does not refer to him as an astronaut. He is listed only as “payload specialist.” A nongovernment worker, he was responsible for running highly technical experiments in space. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_016_STS-51D_Press_Kit.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Press kits</a> at the time from NASA public affairs pointedly avoid the A-word when referring to Mr. Walker, and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://historycollection.jsc.nasa.gov/JSCHistoryPortal/history/shuttle_pk/pk/Flight_012_STS-41D_Press_Kit.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">one document</a> specifically called him a “non-astronaut.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“To me, that Charlie Walker thing was so offensive,” Ms. Garver said. “Here was a guy who risked his life just like the rest of them. He did great things on those missions — and this was pre-Challenger disaster. The shuttle at the time was a very experimental system.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For NASA and its affiliates in 2014, internal struggles over who gets to be called astronaut mounted when Michael Alsbury was killed during a test flight of SpaceShipTwo, a Virgin Galactic spacecraft that disintegrated at supersonic speeds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Astronauts Memorial Foundation refused to add Mr. Alsbury’s name to the Space Mirror Memorial, for Americans who have died in spaceflight, at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Among the criteria for memorialization was a requirement that fallen astronauts had to have been on government-flown or government-sponsored spacecraft. But that requirement was added in 2006 — a response in part to the private sector beginning to tread on NASA’s turf.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The memorial committee of the foundation voted in March to change its rules, opening the door for Mr. Alsbury’s name to be added. It is perhaps a reluctant acceptance of the inevitable: that space no longer belonged only to governments, and that the expansion of humanity’s horizon is perilous to all who undertake those efforts, regardless of employer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If a company like Boeing were to hire people to fulfill a role like that — trained to operate a spacecraft, achieve a mission in space as part of a crew, that for me is also a professional astronaut,” said Megan McArthur, a NASA astronaut who flew into space on the shuttle Atlantis and serviced the Hubble Space Telescope.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the same time, as more civilians travel to orbit and beyond to complete commercial or academic work, or even just fly in space as tourists, Dr. McArthur said she could see why some might not be called astronauts. She compared such voyages to her own treks as a graduate student, when she studied aboard oceanic research vessels.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There was a crew that operated the ship and a team that conducted the science,” she explained. Though she was familiar with the boat and sailed in the sea, Dr. McArthur said she would not have called herself a professional sailor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But it is not NASA who bestows the name, said Ms. Garver, who championed <!-- -->commercial space<!-- --> travel while at the agency. To her, calling more people “astronaut” does not diminish the job or make it less special.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Culture will decide <!-- -->what becomes the definition<!-- -->,” she said. “And I think we have run the experiment. If you go to space, you risked your life: You are an astronaut.”</p>',\n",

       " 'audi-tt-anniversary-nissan-z': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The cars came from Germany and Japan decades ago, their makers confident that some design and engineering bravado could conquer the States.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Audi TT, now 20 years old and an enduring, not-so-obscure object of desire, and the Datsun 240Z, unveiled 50 years ago with a hatchback body that looked fast even if it wasn’t, were not particularly powerful by today’s standards. You could shoehorn two tiny adults in the back seat of a TT coupe; the Z had no back seat. Radios? Low fidelity. Navigation? Please. Turbochargers? They were standard on the Audi, and arrived eventually in the Z. Manual transmissions? Absolutely.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Z came to America after a gestation period in Japan in the ’60s. The TT blossomed in 1998 at the Paris auto show after making the rounds as a raved-about concept study. In late maturity now, both cars have, essentially, bottomed out.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most dealers may carry one trim level of the TT or the Z (its Nissan-branded offspring); many dealers won’t stock the cars at all.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you want a Z, you’ll have to order it,” one dealer on Long Island said. “And leave a nonrefundable deposit.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the car industry, when sales flag this much, extinction is imminent. Indeed, there have been rumors that, sooner rather than later, both cars will be killed outright or “reinvented,” possibly as electrics, by their corporate parents — the Volkswagen group and the Renault-Nissan alliance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The post-mortems, doubtless, will be full throated and numerous.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But, to put a reverse spin on Mark Antony’s well-worn eulogy of Caesar, we come here not to bury the Z and the TT but to praise them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“For Audi, the TT was to be sort of a club car,” said the car’s designer, Walter de Silva. The plan, he added, was “to generate a model that was unique for the brand, and all new.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. de Silva, now 68 and living in Munich, was appointed head of Audi design in 2002. From 2007 to 2015, he essentially supervised the design strategy for the entire Volkswagen group, including the TT, the Scirocco, the Passat and the Golf. Today he designs his own line of — wait for it — women’s shoes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although Mr. de Silva considers the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/audi/audi-a5-30-tdi-2007-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">2007 Audi A5 coupe</a> the pinnacle of his automotive design art (“the sex appeal, the shape of the lights, the architecture”), he also boasts about his so-called Singleframe front-end graphics for the TT that migrated across the range.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The bold, upright, trapezoidal elements of the grille “created a brand identity,” Mr. da Silva said. Through the decades it has evolved as the symbol and signature of Audi; on the 20th Anniversary TT, the black grille rather starkly sets off the pearly Aviator Gray paint.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The first-generation TT was an extreme experiment, to raise the sportiness of the Audi brand,” said Dany Garand, an Audi designer in Ingolstadt, Germany, where the company is based.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In fact, TT stands for the Tourist Trophy, the demanding motorcycle race held each year on the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was very far from the mainstream of what Audi was doing at the time: clean, Bauhaus, with a touch of emotion,” Mr. Garand said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The original TT was sculpted as well with input from the designers Freeman Thomas and Peter Schreyer, who is now at Kia. Mr. Garand considers it as an exercise in spheres, “very geometric: The roof is round. All the corners are spherical.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The cabin is one-third the proportion and the body two-thirds,” he added. “This had a very strong influence on the whole lineup of Audi afterwards.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Evolving the current third-generation car, which arrived in 2014, “was not an easy job,” Mr. Garand said. His expectation for the next version “is something more sporty, more radical, yet more true to the original,” he said. “I’m more concerned that we don’t lose the DNA.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As a piece of rolling sculpture, the TT remains, as Mr. de Silva said, a “nice toy.” To mark its 20th birthday, Audi has tweaked the current base model hardtop and roadster with mainly cosmetic niceties, like 19-inch wheels, “trumpet” exhausts that mimic the original, Moccasin Bronze seats that echo the much-loved baseball-glove stitch buckets of Audi TTs past, and two limited colors, Aviator Gray and Nimbus Gray.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The manual transmission, a staple of the original, is gone. The turbocharged four-cylinder motor makes a modest 228 horsepower.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even with the extra equipment and decorations, the birthday pair are no bargain: The starting prices are $53,895 for the coupe and $57,795 for the roadster — $8,000 and $8,400 more than the non-special models. Of the 990 units produced, American dealers will share 80, Audi said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some 30 years before the TT emerged into series production, the Datsun 240Z (Datsun was then part of Nissan Motors) loudly announced the intention of the Japanese to build a mass-market sports car. It didn’t hurt that the sleek fastback with the long hood had design echoes of Jaguar’s fabulous E-type, and that the price — about $3,500, comparable with muscle cars like the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro — was in line with the budgets of younger buyers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the car’s introduction in 1969, Nissan’s president, Yutaka Katayama, emphasized that the Z “was designed to please a demanding taste that is strictly American.” The later company chief Carlos Ghosn praised its “European styling, American muscle, Japanese quality and global desirability.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rob Sass, an expert is classic-car pedigree (and owner of four Zs through the years), said, “It was a groundbreaking car that gave Japanese cars credibility for the first time in the United States.” (Mr. Sass is an occasional contributor to the Wheels column.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A parade of Z cars has marched through showrooms over the decades, from the 240 (actually born as the S30 in Japan) to the 260, the 280ZX, the more exotic <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.simeonemuseum.org/collection/1990-nissan-300zx-twin-turbo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">300ZX</a> and, from 2003, the 297-horsepower <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.kbb.com/nissan/350z/2003/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">350Z</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The 50th anniversary 370Z edition, an example of the sixth generation of the model, emerged in red-and-white racing livery at the recent New York auto show, and, unlike its ancestor, it’s stuffed with bells, whistles and Bose audio. The colors of the special edition mimic those that decorated the motorsports legend <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://classicmotorsports.com/articles/datsun-rising-peter-brock-bre-datsun-240z/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Peter Brock’s BRE 240Z</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pricing starts at just above $37,000 for the birthday model, and, yes, a six-speed manual is offered.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While Mr. Sass suggests that the Z car “may have run its course,” he remains a fan. “Remember that without the Z, there’s probably no RX-7, no Honda S2000, no Toyota MR2,” he said. “It set the future for a whole wave of Japanese sports cars.”</p>',\n",

       " 'best-suvs-2019-mudfest': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For decades, the sedans that dominated American roads had more flavors than Baskin-Robbins: budget-minded, status-symbol, cushy, sporty and everything in between.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Unless you’ve been living under the kind of remote rock an off-roading S.U.V. might crawl over, it’s clear that crossovers and pickups dominate the automotive market today. Less obvious? The sport utility segment has matured so that all of those sedan varieties can still be had, with practicality and a raised ride height to boot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Not everyone wants to look like Ranger Rick, and the models have adapted. These days you can have your crossover chunky, sleek, luxurious, economical or even high performance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here’s why. In 1992, S.U.V.s eked out an 8.8 percent share of the automotive market, with sedans commanding 63.9 percent, according to PwC. By 2017, those numbers had flipped to 42.9 percent for S.U.V.s and crossovers while sedans dropped to 35.5 percent. In short, automakers are chasing the money.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the recent Northwest Outdoor Activity Vehicle of the Year competition, affectionately known as Mudfest, 25 writers from the Northwest Automotive Press Association reminisced about the path that S.U.V.s had taken.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the first Mudfest, in 1995, all but one of the 11 entries used body-on-frame platforms. The Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Suburban and Nissan X-Terra rode like trucks, towed like trucks and conquered terrain like trucks because … they were trucks. The outlier was a tiny new shoelike vehicle with an odd name that Toyota had shipped special from Japan: the RAV4.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This “soft-roader” had all-wheel drive but navigated the muddy mess with a unibody car chassis. The significance of that vehicle can’t be overstated. The makeup of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.nwapa.org/mudfest-2019-winners-announced/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">2019 Mudfest </a> was nearly reversed from the first. Of the 17 sport utilities competing, only the Toyota 4Runner and Mercedes-Benz G550 had body-on-frame construction.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mudfest has always been an excellent barometer of this segment’s evolution. It’s a two-day event where automotive journalists test on- and off-road ability and all of the latest technology. This year, the vehicles ranged in size from the diminutive Hyundai Kona to the family-hauling three-row Volkswagen Atlas.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The field is wide open as automakers make a land grab for America’s garages and driveways. It’s easy to forget that the Mercedes M-Class S.U.V., which made its debut in “The Lost World: Jurassic Park” in 1997, is considered to be the first upmarket sport-ute and a huge risk for the German automaker (though historians often ignore Land Rover’s Range Rover, but I digress).</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The luxury S.U.V. bet paid off for Mercedes in a brontosaur-size way, blazing a trail for BMW, Lexus and Porsche to break out of their stereotypes with the X3, RX300 and Cayenne. The luxury winners at this Mudfest were the BMW X7 xDrive 50i in the Full-Size Luxury category, and the Mercedes GLE450 in the Compact and Midsize Luxury segment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nowadays, automakers gladly offer any crossover essence you could want. Tugging big toys? Any of the truck-based machines from General Motors, Ford, Dodge, Toyota and Nissan will tow boats, water scooters and campers. Luxury starts with any of the small crossovers (Audi A3, Cadillac XT4 and Lexus UX for starters) and spirals up to the Maserati Levante, Bentley Bentayga and even Rolls-Royce with the Cullinan.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Driving enthusiasts lamenting performance sedans get the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio, Porsche Macan Turbo, BMW X3M, and Mercedes AMG GLC63. Those on more of a budget have the frisky Mazda CX-5 and Acura RDX with Super Handling All-Wheel Drive to consider.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Don’t want to drive a box? BMW started the controversial “fastback” look with its X6 and X4. Mercedes followed with the GLC300 Coupe (let’s point out this has four doors, not two). Acura was not so successful with its slope-backed ZDX.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mainstream offerings are all over the map when it comes to earning your business. The winner of Mudfest’s Mid- and Full-Size Family category was the three-row 2020 Kia Telluride SX AWD, most likely because of its blend of Chris Hemsworth looks, technology-stuffed interior and fully loaded price of $47,330. For something less Woodsy Owl, Kia’s corporate cousin Hyundai offers a more genteel look with the Palisade.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The sheer number of S.U.V.s that span sport, luxury, economy, hybrid and family segments are too numerous to stuff into this column. It would simply become a list. It’s safe to say that if the vibe can be had in a sedan, it’s available as a sport utility.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The same goes for pickup trucks. At Mudfest, the members evaluated five of them, and each came to the competition with a different mission. The midsize Ford Ranger is an everyday workhorse that hauls bikes and kayaks in comfort. The Ram 2500 Power Wagon can rip a house off its foundation and winch itself over a small mountain of gravel (in case you do those sorts of things). The <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/business/2020-jeep-gladiator.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Jeep Gladiator</a> Rubicon, a triple winner with Extreme Capability, Best Pickup and Northwest Outdoor Vehicle of the Year trophies, is equal parts Jeep Wrangler, midsize pickup and Leatherman tool.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Nissan Titan and GMC Sierra Denali AT4 were the two traditional offerings, but even the Sierra had its own personality with the trick MultiPro tailgate that’s a step, a standing desk, a load extender and more in one origami-like package. And for luxury, a Ram 1500 Limited or Ford F150 Limited will coddle discerning executives whether they’re in construction or high finance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The market isn’t resting. Toyota’s RAV4 has risen from its humble beginnings to become the best-selling passenger vehicle in the United States. Ditching its city-slicker looks, the new model clearly took grooming tips from the company’s aggressive 4Runner S.U.V. Curiously, the brand’s 2020 Highlander smooths out its outdoorsy attitude for a more suburban vibe.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The big Mudfest takeaway is that buyers will get a lot more out of their vehicle if they consider their lifestyles and then choose the rig that best fits their needs. That has always been the case when choosing sedans, and now S.U.V.s offer a rich variety of ability and attitude.</p>',\n",

       " 'bird-amber-toe': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some 99 million years ago, a small animal with a weird elongated <!-- -->toe<!-- --> died and became partially entombed in amber. Its lower leg and foot remained undisturbed in the hardened tree resin until amber miners eventually discovered the fossil in Myanmar’s Hukawng Valley in 2014.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The preserved toe measures less than half an inch from knuckle to claw-tip, making it 41 percent longer than the next longest digit on the animal’s foot. When traders showed the curious specimen to <!-- -->Chen Guang<!-- -->, a curator at China’s Hupoge Amber Museum, they suggested that it probably belonged to an extinct lizard.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Chen thought that the remains looked more like an avian species, so he looped in Lida Xing, a paleontologist at China University of Geosciences who specializes in Cretaceous birds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was very surprised at the time,” Dr. Xing said, recalling that the fossil was “undoubtedly the claw of a bird.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A handful of Cretaceous bird fossils have been found in Burmese amber, but this is the first to be identified as a new species. Named Elektorornis<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em>(“amber bird”) chenguangi, the specimen is described in a study, led by Dr. Xing, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)30691-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">published Thursday</a> in Current Biology.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">E. chenguangi was <!-- -->smaller than a modern sparrow<!-- --> and belonged to a family of birds called Enantiornithes, which was abundant during the Cretaceous period.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Its elongated toe structure has never been observed in other birds, living or extinct. Its foot also sported an unusual layer of bristled feathers, “unlike any adult bird known today,” according to Jingmai O’Connor, a co-author and paleontologist at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Long toes are associated with arboreal animals that need a firm grip on tree branches. The bristles suggest that the bird’s foot also had a sophisticated sensory system. Dr. Xing’s team speculated that E. chenguangi may have used the long, sensitive digit to probe cracks in trees for insects and grubs, just as the aye-aye lemur uses a slim finger to extract food in modern Madagascar.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These sorts of special adaptations may have helped propel Enantiornithes to evolutionary success during the age of dinosaurs. At that time, Enantiornithes overshadowed Neornithes, the group that contains all modern avian species. But that abruptly changed when a huge asteroid hit Earth 66 million years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Enantiornithes were wiped out along with the non-avian dinosaurs, while Neornithes went on to become the diverse group of birds — from ostriches to penguins, eagles to hummingbirds — that currently inhabits our planet.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“<!-- -->Enantiornithines<!-- --> were good enough to survive and dominate in the Cretaceous but maybe not good enough to make it through the mass extinction,” Dr. O’Connor said. She noted that the faster maturation cycles and more efficient digestive systems of Neornithes may have given them an edge.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Enantiornithines may no longer be with us, but this amber fossil has provided a sepia-toned snapshot of their lives and their world.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While many fossils trapped in amber like this one are reshaping our understanding of the distant past, they may also be <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/fossils-burmese-amber-offer-exquisite-view-dinosaur-times-and-ethical-minefield\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">amplifying intractable social tensions</a> in Myanmar in the present.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Some of these specimens have big price tags, and that money might in some cases help fund armed conflict in Myanmar between the government and militias,” said Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These fossils are hugely important, and the scientists studying them have done an excellent job, but I want to be sure that these <!-- -->fossils were not incidentally complicit in human suffering.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. O’Connor agreed that she and her colleagues had growing awareness about ethical problems with the amber trade, but said, “It’s the conflict that has dragged the amber into it, not the other way around.”</p>',\n",

       " 'born-to-walk-barefoot': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wearing shoes when we walk changes how our feet interact with the ground below us, according to a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1345-6\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">novel new study in the journal Nature</a> of shod and unshod walkers, the state of their feet and the extent of the forces they generate with every step. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The study, which echoes some of the research that first popularized barefoot running, finds that walkers move differently when they are barefoot or shod and have differing sensitivity to the ground, potentially affecting balance and joint loading. The results intimate that there could be advantages to perambulating with naked feet, not the least of which, surprisingly, involves developing calluses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We humans are born to walk. Distance running during hunts may have been important for the survival of early homo sapiens, most evolutionary biologists agree. But our forebears almost certainly spent far more time walking than jogging, just as modern hunter-gatherers do.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Shoes, though, are new to us. Archaeological finds indicate that humans first started wearing rudimentary sandals about 40,000 years ago, an eyeblink in our history as a species. Before then, nature seems to have deemed that our best protection for bare feet would be tough skin. So, people who walk without shoes develop hard, leathery calluses on the heels and balls of their feet that can reduce sensations of pain when they stride over small obstacles like gravel.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today, many of us might consider such calluses unsightly and disagreeable. But Daniel Lieberman, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University who, with various colleagues, conducted much of the early research into barefoot running, began to wonder recently whether those calluses might have a hidden utility and beauty. Might they, he wondered, protect and guide feet during walking in ways that shoes cannot? And, if so, what does that tell us about walking and footwear?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To learn more, he and a team of collaborators traveled to Kenya for the new study with a portable ultrasound machine and a device that sends slight prickles of electrical current through the skin to test nerve reactions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Kenya, they recruited 81 local men and women, about half of whom had grown up in cities wearing shoes, while the rest had spent most of their lives walking barefoot. They asked everyone to remove their shoes, if they wore them, and examined the revealed skin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As they had expected, they found that people who had grown up walking barefoot had large, tough calluses on their feet. Ultrasound readings showed that these skin patches were about 25 percent to 30 percent thicker than any calluses on the feet of the group who usually wore shoes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More unexpected, the calluses were sensitive, in specialized ways. Dr. Lieberman and his colleagues had thought that the hardened skin might block nerves deep within the skin from sensing the ground, which could affect balance and movement. But when they measured those nerves’ reactions in people with and without calluses, they found few differences, suggesting that while calluses lessen people’s sensation of walking over pebbles, they do not prevent us from feeling the earth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Finally, to test whether being barefoot and having calluses do affect how people move, Dr. Lieberman and his collaborators asked some of the Kenyans to walk unshod over a plate that measures forces generated while striding. The plate registered almost no variations in their strides, whether they had thick calluses or none.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But back in Boston for the final element of the study, the researchers found that shoes can shake up a walk. When male and female volunteers strolled on treadmills at Dr. Lieberman’s lab while barefoot, they struck the ground in about the same way as the unshod walkers in Kenya had.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But when those same volunteers donned average, cushioned sneakers, their walking subtly altered. They began striking the ground a little more lightly at first, presumably because the footwear’s cushioning absorbed some of the force, but the impacts from each stride lingered longer than when they were barefoot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Such persistent impacts tend to move up and dissipate through our leg bones, ankles and knee joints, whereas the shorter, sharper jolts created when we walk barefoot are more likely to rise through our soft muscles and tendons, Dr. Lieberman says.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What these findings suggest, in aggregate, is that what we wear on our feet shapes the way that we walk, and that nature would make a fine footwear engineer, Dr. Lieberman says. Shoes protect our feet and sop up some of the slight pounding during a walk, he says, but they also alter our strides and could, over time, increase the pressure and wear on our leg joints. Meanwhile, calluses shield us from some of the discomforts and pointy objects we encounter while barefoot, but do not reduce our contact with and feel for the ground.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So, the message of the study would seem to be that people who have concerns about their balance or their knees but not their pedicures might consider sometimes walking barefoot, he says.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Walking barefoot can be fun,” he says, although it is not for everyone or every situation. When winter ends and warmth returns to Harvard, he often sheds his shoes and encourages new calluses, he says. “But I wear shoes most of the time.”</p>',\n",

       " 'british-open-portrush-rory-mcilroy': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland — Rory McIlroy will assuredly receive the loudest ovations throughout the British Open. McIlroy, a native of Northern Ireland and the third-ranked golfer in the world, has already drawn hordes of spectators to his practice rounds at Royal Portrush Golf Club, the tournament site and a course he has played since he was 10.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But forget that McIlroy is the presumptive favorite as the Open returns to his golf-crazed home for the first time in nearly 70 years. When the Open begins on Thursday, he knows the moment will be “bigger than me.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“To be able to have this tournament here again, I think it speaks volumes of where the country is and where the people that live here are now,” McIlroy said, referring to the three decades of bloody political turmoil known euphemistically as “the Troubles.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re so far past that,” he said, “and that’s a wonderful thing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ian Bamford, who was the North of Ireland Amateur Open champion in 1954 and 1972 and has been a member of Royal Portrush since 1944, recently discussed the effects of the conflict, which claimed some 3,600 lives, and what it meant for his beloved game’s position in Northern Ireland.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The turmoil was terrible, the number of deaths, the number of families that were being broken up,” Bamford, 86, said. “The Open was very far from people’s minds. Golf clubs were being blown up. The game itself was in jeopardy, although the championships went on.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bamford watched as the Englishman Max Faulkner won the Open in 1951, when it was last held at Royal Portrush. The club gradually climbed back to prominence after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 stemmed the insurgency.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Portrush hosted the 2004 Senior British Open and the 2011 Irish Open, both critical steps. Then the Irishman Padraig Harrington won consecutive Open titles in 2007 and 2008, and Graeme McDowell, a Portrush native, won the 2010 United States Open. In June 2014 Peter Dawson, then the R&amp;A chief executive, announced the return of the championship to Northern Ireland.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McDowell, who qualified for this year’s Open by sinking a 30-foot putt on the 18th hole at the Canadian Open in June, said the return to his hometown had been extraordinarily meaningful.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The buzz from the people this week, it’s been amazing the past few days,” the 39-year-old McDowell said after practicing in front of scores of supporters this week. “This should put Portrush on the global stage, and it should, hopefully, look amazing on TV this weekend.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bamford called the Dunluce Links, the Open course, a “masterpiece of design more enduring than brass.” Designed by Harry Colt, it opened in July 1933.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That may well be, but considerable changes were made to accommodate the championship and the huge crowds it is expected to draw. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.independent.ie/sport/golf/the-british-open/exclusive-holebyhole-guide-to-royal-portrush-2019-open-championship-course-38322848.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Two new holes were built</a>: the 592-yard, par-5 seventh, and the daunting 434-yard, par-4 eighth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Tiger Woods, the reigning Masters champion, is seeking his fourth British Open win and his first since 2006. On Northern Ireland’s rugged coast, he will have to decipher a course that he is playing for the first time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It can play so many ways, depends on the wind,” Woods said. “Some of the bunkers here, you wonder why the hell is it there, and then all of a sudden it’s in play.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Brooks Koepka, the four-time major winner, may have an advantage because his caddie, Ricky Elliott, grew up in Portrush.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Definitely have a little bit more confidence having him on the bag this week, knowing this course so well,” Koepka said. “I don’t think when he grew up that he ever thought there would be an Open Championship here.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Elliott has already helped navigate the area, having <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://golfweek.com/2019/07/15/golf-open-championship-portrush-northern-ireland/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">reportedly warned</a> Rickie Fowler that his trademark orange shirts, a nod to his Oklahoma State days, could carry a different significance in Northern Ireland, where the color has long represented Protestant loyalties.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McIlroy, who grew up near the capital, Belfast, holds the Dunluce Links record of 61, a score he fired as a 16-year-old in 2005.

       " 'budget-negotiators-mick-mulvaney': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">WASHINGTON — As the federal government inches closer toward a potentially disastrous default on its debts, lawmakers and some Trump administration officials desperate for a budget deal have carefully maneuvered negotiations away from the man who has emerged as the common enemy: Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Mulvaney made his name in the House as an ardent opponent of federal spending, even willing to risk a default crisis to secure deep budget cuts. But in the coming days, Washington must come together to raise the government’s statutory borrowing limit before the Treasury Department runs out of money to pay its bills, possibly in early September, and raise spending caps to stave off across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to sweep through the government next year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To do it, congressional negotiators from both parties have elevated Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, at Mr. Mulvaney’s expense.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Mulvaney is one of the people who shut down government because they didn’t want to lift the debt ceiling, and so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over the past week, Ms. Pelosi has spoken to Mr. Mnuchin on the phone at least five times, sometimes multiple times a day, and the conversations have prompted cautious optimism among lawmakers that a deal can be reached before the House is set to leave next week.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are understanding each other,” Ms. Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday, after she and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, spoke with Mr. Mnuchin for about 30 minutes. “We would like to have something on the floor next Thursday.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Mnuchin, speaking on CNBC on Thursday, said that the pair had agreed on how much to raise both domestic and military spending over the next two years as part of a two-year debt ceiling increase. Left up for debate is how to offset some or all of the new spending and what Mr. Mnuchin called “certain structural issues.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I don’t think the markets should be concerned,” he said. “We’re working hard, we’ll get there one way or another.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since Congress emerged bruised and battered in January from <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/08/us/politics/government-shutdown-calendar.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a record 35-day shutdown</a>, lawmakers have been eager to avoid a budgetary breakdown. They have been blunt about their distrust of Mr. Mulvaney, a founder of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus whose political career was shaped by crusading against the type of deal the White House and Congress are now seeking. Senior officials on Capitol Hill involved in the budget talks describe him alternately as a “problem child” or a “troublemaker” or just “not helpful.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A former congressman from South Carolina, Mr. Mulvaney came of age politically during the Tea Party movement, helped orchestrate a government shutdown during the Obama era and has expressed doubts about what virtually all economists say would be the dire consequences of defaulting on government debt. Giving him a seat at the budget talks, lawmakers say privately, is like putting an arsonist at the table to establish a fire prevention plan.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is a man who never voted for an appropriations bill,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. “He doesn’t bring a great deal of credibility to it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, prefers to note Mr. Mulvaney’s presence in the room — “He was there,” he said after one meeting — before pivoting to the importance of having Mr. Mnuchin doing the talking.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wall Street analysts are also watching Mr. Mulvaney warily. Henrietta Treyz, the economic policy director at Veda Partners, a market analysis firm outside Washington, wrote in a note to clients this week that the threat of a presidential veto and Mr. Mulvaney’s hawkish views were the most significant risks to a deal falling apart.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In contrast, Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood film producer, tends to be the Trump administration’s voice of moderation, willing to compromise to reach a deal. Last month, Mr. Mnuchin emerged from a meeting in Ms. Pelosi’s office to tell reporters that the White House was not looking for a shutdown fight or flirting with a debt limit default. Mr. Mulvaney stood, red-faced, to his left, waiting for a chance to interject.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the Treasury secretary stopped speaking, the acting chief of staff jumped in, charging Ms. Pelosi with having raised her spending demands and asserting — incorrectly — that she had promised to raise the debt ceiling no matter what, a shift, he insisted, from her previous position.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I shouldn’t even be engaged in a conversation that has him mischaracterizing,” Ms. Pelosi later said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By no means has Mr. Mulvaney been completely shut out: A White House official said that on Tuesday, Mr. Mulvaney participated in a meeting with the president about the debt ceiling. And two administration officials said that Mr. Trump’s lack of interest in the talks meant that the acting chief of staff could dip in and out of the discussions, sticking to the big picture without getting sucked into the minutiae.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At times, he has privately expressed bemusement at what he calls Mr. Mnuchin’s naïveté when it comes to haggling with Congress. In the spring, when Mr. Mnuchin suggested that House Democrats would be amenable to a “clean” raising of the debt ceiling — without preconditions, like raising the spending caps — Mr. Mulvaney insisted that Ms. Pelosi would surely try to extract concessions — as he would have.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He is likely to be proved right.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And Mr. Mulvaney certainly sees himself in charge. At a Heritage Foundation forum on Wednesday, Mr. Mulvaney said that he often joked that the White House budget office was now under the conservative think tank’s management.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But two administration officials acknowledged that Mr. Mulvaney’s diminished role in the budget negotiations could be in response to the bipartisan contingency on Capitol Hill that does not want him there. Mr. Mulvaney was seen poorly by those legislators, White House officials suggested, because they want to spend more than he does.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Like Ms. Pelosi, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has also singled out Mr. Mnuchin as the preferred lead negotiator among the three administration officials — Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Mulvaney and the acting budget director, Russell T. Vought — who have traipsed up to the Capitol in recent weeks for talks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“By all accounts, Secretary Mnuchin is very outcome driven and that’s what this is about,” said Antonia Ferrier, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell. “He’s uniquely positioned to work this through, because he’s dispassionate, he listens, he’s respected and he’s not playing games.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Aides to Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney say that the two men have a constructive working relationship, but that their backgrounds, ideologies and negotiating styles starkly differ. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said, “The president has confidence in his team and the progress that is being made.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At times they have knocked heads: Last year, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney clashed over who would have <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-treasury-omb.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the final say about rules</a> for enforcing the Republican tax overhaul passed in 2017. Mr. Mulvaney, then the head of the budget office, succeeded in wresting control over how to interpret tax regulations from the Treasury Department over Mr. Mnuchin’s objections.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Mr. Trump needed to replace his chief of staff in late 2018, some of Mr. Mnuchin’s aides privately expressed dismay that Mr. Mulvaney was tapped for the job.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Aides to both men have said that their differences were largely institutional rather than personal. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Mr. Mulvaney, said that despite the fact that his style differed from Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Mulvaney was ultimately looking for an outcome that would be good for the economy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Good cop, bad cop, he’s happy to play any role that gets the best deal for the hard-working American taxpayer,” Mr. Czwartacki said.</p>',\n",

       " 'bulgaria-hack-cyberattack': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An investigation into the theft of the personal information of nearly every adult in Bulgaria led to the arrest of a 20-year-old computer programmer, the police announced Wednesday, in connection with a breach that underscores the vulnerability of vast troves of digitized information.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The authorities acknowledged that Bulgaria’s national tax agency was hacked after a news outlet received an email on Monday with a taunt and a claim of responsibility. The names, addresses, incomes and social security information of as many as five million Bulgarians and foreign residents — in a country of only seven million — had been taken.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The state of your cybersecurity is a parody,” the self-proclaimed hacker <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2019/07/15/3938643_anonimen_meil_razprostrani_lichni_danni_za_milioni/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">emailed</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Though the police cautioned that the investigation was in its early stages, some officials suggested that Russia might have been behind the attack, as retaliation for the country’s recent purchase of American-made fighter jets. A lawyer for the suspect denied he played any role in the breach.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Regardless of who perpetrated the hack, experts said the breach highlighted the ever-growing danger faced by both governments and their citizens in an increasingly digitized world.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The breach was the largest theft of personal data ever reported in the Balkans — Bulgaria’s prime minister convened an emergency meeting of the nation’s security agencies — and just the latest in a series of attacks that have exposed how much data remains insecure online despite a series of recent high-profile thefts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last year, the United States <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/us/politics/north-korea-sony-hack-wannacry-indictment.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">accused North Korean hackers</a> of crippling Britain’s health care system and stealing millions from Bangladesh, as part of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/us/politics/north-korea-sony-hack-wannacry-indictment.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a yearslong campaign </a>to place ransomware on computers around the world. A few years earlier, American officials said that hackers based in China <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/world/asia/chinese-hackers-pursue-key-data-on-us-workers.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">broke into the computer networks </a>of a United States government agency, exposing the personal information of more than 21.5 million people.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Corporations have suffered even larger breaches. Thieves stole more than 140 million Social Security numbers <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/business/equifax-breach.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">from the credit agency Equifax</a>, hackers exposed the data of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/business/marriott-data-breach.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">up to 500 million Mariott International guests</a>, and attacks on the tech giant Yahoo <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/yahoo-hack.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">compromised more than 1 billion user accounts</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, many governments have concentrated their attention on areas deemed “critical infrastructure” — such as energy and defense networks — a category that does not always include vast repositories of personal data.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since becoming a member of NATO in 2004, Bulgaria has steadily worked to bolster its cyberdefenses, and in June it became a member of a NATO program, the Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, meant to help member nations improve their cybersecurity capabilities.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Dr. Vesselin Bontchev, an assistant professor at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and a cybersecurity expert, said that the government — like many others — needed to broaden its view of what is vital to national security.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many government officials, he said, “were worried mostly about the usual that gets discussed in the Western press — hybrid warfare, Russian disinformation and meddling, attacks against the critical infrastructure — that sort of thing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But those were “largely theoretical problems,” he said. “I didn’t see anyone being particularly worried about viruses, ransomware, data breaches, phishing and other everyday cybersecurity problems. Although, arguably, the National Revenue Agency is critical infrastructure.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The breach of the National Revenue Agency, Bulgaria’s tax authority, is believed to have occurred in June and may have continued for some time. It was not made public until Monday, after news outlets around the country received an email — which came from a Russian address — claiming responsibility for the attack.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But like with so many cyberattacks, taking an inventory of the damage was a simpler task than assigning blame and understanding the broader implications.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As residents of one of the European Union’s newest and poorest member states wrestled with how the breach might affect their lives — with many fearing identity theft, and scores going to social media to mock their government — public officials offered a variety of theories about who might have been responsible.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most attacks of this nature in Eastern and Central Europe are financially motivated, the tactic of criminal gangs looking to sell the information or use it for blackmail. David Balson, the director of intelligence at Ripjar, a security company in Britain, said it was becoming easier and easier to conduct this type of attack, with open-source tools readily available online.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Personal data, including job titles and their associated income, would be of interest to all kinds of actors. “There’s a lot of incentive to go after this data, regardless of the barriers to entry,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The value of this kind of data could range from $10 to a few hundred per identity, he said. “You’re looking at a hack that could be worth as much as $200 million,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Because the suspect worked for a cybersecurity firm, there was some speculation that the hack might have been a so-called “white hat” attack, perpetrated to expose vulnerabilities in the government’s computer networks and create public pressure to fix it. But the lawyer for the suspect rejected that theory, saying the suspect wasn’t involved at all in the attack.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Other government officials suggested that the country might have been targeted by Russia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mladen Marinov, the interior minister, said that the authorities had to remember the political context in which the attack took place, an apparent reference to Bulgaria’s relations with Russia and the West. This spring, Bulgaria finalized the details of its largest-ever foreign military acquisition since the end of Communist rule in 1989, agreeing to spend nearly <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/07/10/world/europe/10reuters-bulgaria-usa-jets.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">$1.3 billion to buy eight F-16<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>fighter jets</a> from the United States.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Organized criminal groups involved in cyberattacks usually seek financial profits, but here political motives are possible,” Mr. Marinov said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov called an emergency meeting of the nation’s security agencies to discuss the ramifications of the attack. He told reporters that the incident showed that there were some “brilliant minds” working in the country’s tech sector, many of whom should be working for the state.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It seems like education is getting better and better, especially in the I.T. field,” he said on Wednesday. “We have some true wizards.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Maya Alexandrova, a senior associate at a law firm in Sofia specializing in cybersecurity, said Bulgaria had introduced a legal framework for dealing with cybersecurity issues only last year. Private companies, she said, have been working to enhance their defenses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Unfortunately I could not say the same thing for the government authorities,” she said. The state authorities, she said, “are not keeping up.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The case could also test the European Union’s ability to help a member nation, in both its investigation and any possible retaliation. The European Council recently passed its first legal framework that would allow the bloc to sanction people or networks involved in cyberattacks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But first, blame must be assigned, which can be difficult even outside the murky world of cyberattacks, in which the lines can be blurred between criminals, state-sponsored groups and intelligence agencies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yavor Kolev, the head of the Bulgarian police’s cybersecurity unit, said that it was too early in the investigation to draw any firm conclusions. But he said that they had uncovered evidence that “suggests that the suspect is connected to the crime.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The suspect, identified by his lawyer as Kristiyan Boikov, worked for the TAD Group, a private cybersecurity firm.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Kolev said that Mr. Boikov had engaged in criminal activity in the past. “In his life, he has been on both sides,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">However, Mr. Boikov’s lawyer, Georgi Stefanov, said that his name had been given to the police by a competing cybersecurity company in an attempt to frame his client.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Kristiyan in an expert in his field,” Mr. Stefanov told reporters in Sofia. He added that if he wanted to hack the tax authority’s database, the Bulgarian police would never have found a trace.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Tuesday, the same day Mr. Boikov was taken into custody, Bulgarian news outlets received another email from the alleged hacker. The writer, who claimed to be a Russian citizen married to Bulgarian woman, taunted officials, saying the government will never find him. “They will just cover up the real truth,” he wrote.<br/></p>',\n",

       " 'candida-auris-fungus-chicago': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Gregory Spoor got the distressing news about his wife on the morning of Jan. 16 while standing outside her room in the intensive care unit at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. The doctor explained that Stephanie Spoor, 64, had contracted a “rare, very rare, fungus.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The physician said the fungus was called Candida auris, and it appeared to have entered her bloodstream through a catheter or other intravenous line during her treatment. Mr. Spoor sent a text to the couple’s four children.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Hey guys, I’m very sorry to do this via text but you need to know and not fair to wait until all of us are together,” he wrote. “The fungus mom has is the worst possible and can be terminal.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added: “It is a day to day issue so I don’t have any more answers or info at this time.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Spoor, 67, an executive at a plumbing equipment company, wasn’t the only one with few answers. C. auris, a germ that typically is resistant to major antifungal medications, has been quietly confounding doctors, hospitals and infectious disease scientists around the world.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">First identified in the ear of a woman in Japan in 2009 (“auris” is Latin for “ear”), the germ has<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> spread around the globe</a>, mostly appearing in hospitals and nursing homes, where it afflicts people with weakened immune systems.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nearly 600 cases of C. auris <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">have been reported</a> in the United States, the majority of them in New York, New Jersey and Illinois. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of people who contract the illness die within 90 days. But the true death rate is difficult to quantify because most patients have other medical conditions and their deaths may be attributed to other causes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About 90 percent of C. auris strains are resistant to at least one drug, and 30 percent are resistant to two or more of the three major classes of antifungal drugs. However, on Tuesday, the C.D.C. confirmed that it has learned in the last month of the first known cases in the United States of so-called “pan-resistant” C. auris — a strain resistant to all major antifungals, said Dr. Tom Chiller, head of the agency’s fungal division, in an interview.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Such cases have been seen in several countries, including India and South Africa, but the two new cases, from New York State, have not been reported previously. Dr. Chiller said that it appeared that, in each case, the germ evolved during treatment and became pan-resistant, confirming a fear that the infection will continue to develop more effective defenses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s happening and it’s going to happen,” Dr. Chiller said. “That’s why we need to remain vigilant and rapidly identify and control these infections.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It often has been hard to gather details about the path of C. auris because hospitals and nursing homes have been unwilling to publicly disclose outbreaks or discuss cases, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/health/candida-auris-hospitals-drug-resistant.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">creating a culture of secrecy</a> around the infection. States have kept confidential the locations of hospitals where outbreaks have occurred, citing patient confidentiality and a risk of unnecessarily scaring the public.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor’s family contacted The New York Times to share details of her case after reading <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">an article in the newspaper about the emergence of C. auris</a> and the growing threat of drug resistant infections. Her experience sheds some light on the experience of dealing with the new health threat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Northwestern Memorial has not issued any public announcement that it had cases of C. auris. The Illinois Department of Public Health confirmed Ms. Spoor’s case after the family gave officials permission to discuss it with The Times. But it would not disclose the identities of what it called “numerous” hospitals and nursing homes that have reported a total of 158 cases in the state since 2016.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Northwestern Memorial declined to answer any questions from The Times about Ms. Spoor’s case, despite receiving permission from the Spoor family to cooperate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The hospital also declined to respond to questions about how many C. auris cases it has treated, whether there were any current cases, what precautions it was taking and other queries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“After careful consideration, we are going to pass on participating in this story,” Christopher King, a hospital spokesman, wrote in an email in response to questions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Generally, health care institutions have said that they do not want to worry the public unnecessarily, given that they are working hard to control the spread of the infection and also that the germ is not a health threat to the general public. The people at the greatest risk are those who have compromised immune systems, typically through illness and age, and who are in hospitals and nursing homes where many infections are carried and transmitted.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor’s tale reveals the powerlessness of patients and institutions in the face of resistant infections.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Late last year, Ms. Spoor began experiencing shortness of breath and appeared to be having a surge of symptoms from lupus, an autoimmune disorder she had been diagnosed with years earlier but that did not seem to disrupt her daily life. Now, her lungs were having trouble absorbing oxygen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor’s family kept a detailed diary of the events, at her request. She went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a highly ranked academic medical center affiliated with Northwestern University. There, in mid-December, she had a biopsy that led to complications: The wound bled and she went into cardiac arrest. She was revived and put on a device called an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine to help her breathe.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That machine was considered a way station to help Ms. Spoor survive until she could receive a lung transplant. She felt hopeful she would be able to see her youngest son, Zack, get married in a ceremony planned for June.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But a month later, a blood test found C. auris. Ms. Spoor’s medical records, which the family shared with The Times, contained a note in mid-January in bold type: “This is a highly transmissible fungus that has a propensity to develop resistance.” The records continued, again in bold type, that it was necessary to “discuss with nurses to maintain diligent contact precautions and limited visitors if possible.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those records indicated that the hospital suspected Ms. Spoor picked up the infection from one of the tubes inserted into her body.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor’s son Nicholas, 40, a Chicago architect, said that the day his mother was diagnosed with C. auris, he noticed the nurses and doctors in full protective aprons and gloves, using bleach to wipe off their feet when they entered and left the room. Everything in the room had a white glaze, he said, from the chemicals used to clean it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was like a laboratory,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the family was hopeful. A doctor told them, Nicholas recalled, “that the strain they had had at Northwestern had been susceptible to the drug cocktail they were currently giving her, and they expected it to clear up.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Indeed, according to the medical records, initial lab tests suggested that the strain of C. auris that had infected Ms. Spoor’s bloodstream was susceptible to the hospital’s drug treatment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The records also included hints of doubt. “Limited literature on C. auris indicates a relatively high mortality and this pathogen may be difficult to eradicate,” a Jan. 19 notation said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over the latter half of January, doctors and nurses furiously tried to treat the fungus, but it kept growing back. The drugs weren’t working. Ms. Spoor appeared fatigued, the family said, but was not showing any other particularly obvious signs of infection.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Barely two months earlier, before her biopsy, Ms. Spoor had been thrilled to accept an early Christmas present from the family: She attended a speech by Michelle Obama at the United Center in downtown Chicago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, in the early days of February, she and her family were being told to put her affairs in order. A doctor told Ms. Spoor that there was nothing more to be done. A transplant wasn’t realistic until she was clear of C. auris, but there seemed to be no effective treatment for the infection.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Feb. 8, their grief was suspended briefly and the atmosphere in her hospital room turned celebratory. The Spoors’ youngest son, Zack, married his fiancée, Carley, in a wedding ceremony at her bedside.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bride and groom wore protective blue hospital gowns over their formal wear, and blue gloves. After the chaplain pronounced them husband and wife, said a blessing and an “Amen,” Ms. Spoor grinned as if she had beat the devil at cards.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A few days later, after consulting with the family, doctors removed Ms. Spoor from the oxygenation machine — her life support, essentially. In the hours before, Ms. Spoor said there was one last person she’d like to speak with: her son Nicholas, with whom she had not yet had a final heart-to-heart conversation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“She just said what you’d expect a mom to say to you in that situation,” Mr. Spoor recounted. He tried to elaborate, but began to cry: “I can’t talk about it. She just said the exact right thing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor died on Feb. 11. Her death certificate describes the cause as respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Rosalind Ramsey-Goldman, a rheumatologist who treated Ms. Spoor, said she felt for the family. “Understandably, her family has had a hard time dealing with their loss,” she said. “And as providers, we too were saddened by the events that transpired, and that we were not able to help her when she had this infection.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor’s husband, Greg, said he bore no grudge against the hospital and, in fact, found its care exceptional. He said he wished that he had known to ask about C. auris and the precautions the hospital was taking.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was something that we didn’t even know was out there, and then it happened and it was one of the major reasons she died,” said her son Nicholas. “If you’re not sharing the data about the patients, that’s an issue.”</p>',\n",

       "   'title': 'How a Chicago Woman Fell Victim to Candida Auris, a Drug-Resistant Fungus'}},\n",
       " 'candida-auris-hospitals-ny': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">New York State health officials are considering rigorous new requirements for hospitals and nursing homes to prevent the spread of a deadly drug-resistant fungus called <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Candida auris</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The requirements could include mandatory pre-admission screening of patients believed to be at-risk and placing in isolation those patients who are infected, or even those just carrying the fungus on their skin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Howard Zucker, the state health commissioner, and a fungal expert from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met last Friday in Manhattan with nearly 60 hospital officials from across the state to discuss the proposed guidelines. State health officials said they were seeking hospital input before issuing the guidelines, which they acknowledged would likely be a hardship for some institutions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Screening can be costly and time-consuming, but the officials said they are determined to stop the spread of C. auris, a fungus of mysterious origin that has been quietly spreading around the world since it was first identified in 2009. Most of the state’s 331 cases of the disease, which is often resistant to antifungal medication, were in Brooklyn and Queens.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While C. auris is not the first drug-resistant germ to take hold, it is so dangerous and easily spread that it is putting new kinds of pressures on the health care system. One hallmark of C. auris is that it can be very difficult to clean from equipment or clothing, and it may spread through the air. Officials suspect that the spores can be shaken loose from bedding and they have been known to cling to walls and ceiling tiles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“One of our guiding objectives is to stop the geographic spread,” said Brad Hutton, the state’s deputy commissioner of public health. He said the state’s efforts to contain the spread have required significant resources — including sending individual infection specialists to investigate more than 150 cases — and that New York now needs help from individual institutions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re at a point where our response strategy needs to change,” he said. He added that he hoped the guidelines would be finalized by the end of the year, but said the state is still determining whether to apply them statewide or just to New York City and surrounding areas. It has yet to be decided whether the guidelines would be recommendations or regulatory requirements, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Zeynep Sumer King, a vice president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group that represents hospitals in the metropolitan region, described the meeting as “very productive and very collaborative.” But she said hospitals raised concerns about such matters as whether hospitals have lab capacity and expertise to handle on-site testing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For the moment, she said, hospitals are pre-screening many patients who appear to be at risk. But it can take a week to get skin-swab results back from the state laboratory, posing challenges for housing patients in isolation during the interim. Further, she said, regular testing is likely to turn up patients who are carriers but not infected, increasing the number of patients who require isolation, appropriately or not.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The more we screen the more we find colonized cases,” she said, “That takes up space and more beds.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The steps proposed by New York, while “draconian,” are probably right to do, said Matthew Fischer, a professor of fungal epidemiology at Imperial College London, and co-author of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/739\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a recent scientific review</a> on the rise of resistant fungi. “We’re dealing with something very unusual here,” he said. “I think it seems wise, seeing as we don’t really know what we’re dealing with, to at least attempt control.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The thoughts were echoed by Dr. Tom Chiller, head of the fungal division of the C.D.C., who said New York is “at the forefront and has not shied away” from tackling an issue for which it has been “ground zero.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Going for it now makes sense,” he said, adding of auris: “We have to see if we can stamp it out or keep it in check.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The germ has also spread in New Jersey and Illinois, particularly the Chicago area. The spread of the germ in some hospitals and nursing homes <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/health/candida-auris-hospitals-drug-resistant.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">has been cloaked in secrecy</a> even as it can lead to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/health/candida-auris-fungus-chicago.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">devastating outcomes</a> for individual patients and their families.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">According to the C.D.C., 90 percent of C. auris infections are resistant to at least one drug and 30 percent resistant to at least two drugs. New York State has seen three cases that are resistant to all known treatments. The C.D.C. reports that nearly half the patients who contract C. auris die within 90 days. Most people infected by the germ are already are very ill or have compromised immune systems.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is patients like these that New York state health officials would like to see “prescreened” when they arrive at a hospital — including people who have recently stayed at a hospital intensive care unit or nursing home in Brooklyn or Queens; and those who are on ventilators, catheters or other invasive equipment that allow the infection to enter the body.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. King, from the hospital association, said that hospitals are already screening patients from nursing homes in the affected areas.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The germ is so virulent that the C.D.C. recommends those infected or even just colonized with the fungus — meaning they carry the disease without being infected — should be isolated in individual rooms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For now, much of the burden for surveillance has fallen to the state. The effort has involved the development of a fast-screening test that can analyze a skin swab in a matter of hours. But all hospitals, for the moment, have to send those tests to a state laboratory in Albany and wait several days before receiving the results, though hospitals say the backlog means tests can take a week.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Officials say they are hoping to eventually deploy the tests so they can be done on-site. An additional challenge is dealing with an unusual aspect of C. auris: It doesn’t seem to go away once it’s on the skin, said Dr. Eleanor Adams, a state public health physician who has led the surveillance efforts of C. auris in New York City.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Adams and her team have made 173 visits to follow-up on suspected and confirmed cases at hospitals and nursing homes, and also to test people who came in contact with infected patients. Initially, she said, the team was testing people infected and colonized every few weeks, but she realized that people who are colonized typically remain that way, sometimes indefinitely.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The question remains if anyone is truly cleared. That is an academic point we don’t know,” she said.</p>',\n",

Every Saturday morning, we email runners with news, advice and some motivation to help you get up and running. </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/running?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Sign up here</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> to get it in your inbox.</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I watched the 2016 Olympic Marathon trials with a bunch of runners at a bar that opened early to host a watch party. Before the race, we were asked to guess which runners would finish in first, second and third place to make the Olympic team. When the guys all listed their top three male choices, I asked, “What about the women?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One rolled his eyes. Another tapped his pen against the bar. Another couldn’t even come up with three names.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Sunday, I watched the United States women’s soccer team in the World Cup final at another bar, which was at maximum capacity. The gender split was about 50/50 between men and women. The men weren’t just there to appease their wives or girlfriends, either. Those at my table knew the team’s roster by heart, and when they started a chant of “We Want Lloyd!” in the final minutes of the game, it was out of their love of Carli Lloyd, a local, who most likely played in her last World Cup game — they were big fans. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/sports/soccer/usa-vs-netherlands-score.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">When the U.S. won</a>, the bar went berserk — with two grade-school boys so moved that they whipped off their shirts to stand on their chairs and cheer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was a rush, not just because this team has been such a pleasure to watch, but because that game was the first time I’ve felt women were being recognized as the incredible athletes that they can be. It wasn’t just women watching and cheering — it was everyone. These women were being treated as real sports champions, not just a bunch of girls to be patted on the head for doing a good job at a lesser version of a men’s game. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whoever thought the women in that 2016 United States Olympic trial weren’t worth watching missed out on the start of a fantastic run of performances. Amy Cragg, Des Linden and Shalane Flanagan didn’t medal in those Olympics, but dominated soon after. In 2017, Cragg won bronze in the World Championships marathon, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.flotrack.org/articles/5967351-amy-cragg-does-it-usa-steals-bronze-medal-in-very-tactical-worlds-marathon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the first American to medal there in 34 years</a>.

We can have a debate as to whether or not the men’s standards are too strict, or how many of those runners really have a shot at making the top three. But the reason I point this out now is because women’s marathoning is another example of how we’re living in a time when the promise of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/inclusion/title-ix-frequently-asked-questions#title\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Title IX</a>, which provides for equal opportunities in school sports, is being realized.

At 22,000 feet above sea level, it’s the second highest active volcano on Earth. Most of the mountain is a barren, red landscape of volcanic rock and dust, with thin, dry air, intense sunlight and winds that will blow your tent down the mountain.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the ground can heat up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, air temperatures rarely reach above freezing. When snow falls, it turns to gas just as it hits the earth. Occasionally, snow can collect in windblown banks, which then melt into icy spires up to 16 feet tall. The Spaniards called these “nieves penitentes,” penitent ones, because they look like <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgYEuJ5u1K0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">hooded monks doing penance</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These conditions high up on the volcano made it seem about as lifeless as Mars. But a team of researchers led by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/steven-k-schmidt\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Steven K. Schmidt</a>, a microbiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://alpinemicrobialobservatory.weebly.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">studies extreme life</a>, have discovered microbes living in and around the penitentes at 17,300 feet above sea level, about one thousand feet above the point at which vegetation stops on Volcan Llullaillaco. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The scientists’ descriptions, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230430.2019.1618115\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">published recently in the journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research</a>, exemplify how life on Earth consistently pushes our expected limits — and may even offer clues to how or where life could exist in similar environments elsewhere in the solar system.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Schmidt thought the volcano might be an ideal place to study the limits of life on Earth after he heard about <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/JGA/article/view/16639\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">three children unearthed there in 1999</a>. The 500-year-old mummies were perfectly preserved without embalming agents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The mummies when buried were “huge bags of microbes,” full of water. That they hadn’t decayed suggested the conditions deep beneath the volcano’s soil were constantly too cold and dry for any life to function.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But what about closer to the surface, where environmental conditions vary?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Schmidt knew <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00248-017-1129-1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">microbes had been found in the surface tephra, or volcanic soil, of the same volcano, as well as a nearby</a> one at slightly lower elevations. But little was known about the summits or penitentes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By discovering what conditions supported patches of life among this mountain’s sterile heights, perhaps he could truly understand life’s limits.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In March 2016, the team hoped to collect soil samples from the summit of Llullaillaco. But after a week’s journey from the coast to the desert, poor weather pushed them to explore the volcano’s penitente fields instead. This was not the volcano’s most extreme environment, but it was still quite harsh and far higher up than where it seemed life could persist.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When someone on the expedition serendipitously noticed red snow at the base of some penitentes, they wondered if it could be <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/science/watermelon-snow-global-warming.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">watermelon snow</a>, an algae found in other frigid environments.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Scientists think penitentes are the result of an unusual mix of conditions, involving wind, temperature fluctuations and the sun’s ultraviolet rays. As tiny indentations in snowpacks melt, penitentes grow up. This also liberates life’s vital elixir — liquid water.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Microscopic and genetic analysis confirmed the red patches at the bottom of the penitentes were snow algae. And the scientists also found cyanobacteria, yeast and even more complex microbes in the ice and shallow tephra downhill from where penitentes melted.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We see the penitentes as an oasis in this harsh landscape,” said Dr. Schmidt, offering water and protection from the elements to wind-carried microbes that were likely dormant before the water reanimated them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And because penitentes are also found in the Himalayas, Pamirs and Hindu Kush — as well as on <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103517303688?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Pluto</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0235-0#author-information\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Europa</a> — a closer look could point the way toward discovering lively oases on other worlds too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I am excited about this finding for its astrobiological implications,” <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://vivo.brown.edu/display/lr3\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Lynn Rothschild</a>, an astrobiologist at Brown University who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email.</p>',\n",

But when a small group of scientists first saw it a decade ago, they knew that it was more than entertaining. If it was real, it offered the first genuine support for a claim Darwin had made 148 years ago, but never proven: that animals perceived and enjoyed music as much as we did.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They wagered an expensive bottle of Spanish wine on whether it was legitimate, and shared that wine several years later when they were finally convinced it was real.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, the team has published <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.05.035\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">their findings</a> in the journal Current Biology, showing that Snowball can not only groove to music without explicit training, but he’s got his own dance moves. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This suggests that sensitivity to music or capacity for music or musicality is shared among more animals than only humans and might have a long evolutionary history,” said Henkjan Honing, a professor of music cognition at the University of Amsterdam, who was not involved in the research, but who paid off the earlier bet. He said research on Snowball’s dancing persuaded him that musicality is an inborn, biological ability, like language, rather than a learned one, like reading.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whether musicality is embedded in biology is still hotly debated. “My dream for my career is to be able to answer it with some feeling of certainty,” said Aniruddh Patel, a professor at Tufts University near Boston, who has led the Snowball research. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If musicality is something that our brain has been shaped to do, that does speak to people’s questions about what human nature is,” said Dr. Patel. The research also raises the question of whether humans have evolved brain specializations for processing music, as we have for language.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Patel first saw Snowball on YouTube in 2008 and called Irena Schulz, who ran the shelter where the parrot lived. She had a background in biology and agreed to participate in a study. They tested Snowball’s ability to stick to the beat at 11 tempos. He isn’t perfect — rather like a toddler in a music class — but his movements sped up or slowed with the music.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Importantly from a scientific perspective, there was no human rocking out in the room with him, or feeding him treats to reward him for his dance moves. He did receive social rewards, like the verbal encouragement “good boy!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He shakes one leg a dozen beats or so, then the other. He moves back and forth across his padded perch. He bobs his head for a bit, and then sways it side to side. He pauses between moves as if considering what to do next. Researchers counted a repertoire of 14 movements, none explicitly taught.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Snowball’s dancing ability was first noticed by a previous owner. One day, he and his daughter saw Snowball bobbing to the Backstreet Boys. They showered him with attention. And Snowball definitely knows that people appreciate his dancing, Dr. Patel said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The team took more than a decade to publish these findings, Dr. Patel said, because life intervened — graduations, children, etc. He and the paper’s lead author, R. Joanne Jao Keehn, both completed the work this year during sabbaticals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Animals that can move to a beat are likely to be those that learn by vocal imitation, like parrots and maybe dolphins and whales (no one’s tested those). One sea lion, named Ronan, has been shown to bob to a beat, defying this hypothesis. Dr. Honing said he can’t explain how a nonverbal imitator like a sea lion could do this. Ronan was also given food rewards for his bobbing, suggesting that his musicality was learned rather than innate, Dr. Patel said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Humans’ close relative, the monkey, can be taught to tap to a metronome, but it’s a learned skill and is tough to teach, Dr. Patel said. They’re better at responding to a tone than predicting another downbeat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Popular culture suggests that many animals can perceive and enjoy music as well as we can. Think of dancing bears, the internet sensation of freestyling dogs and the cliché about music taming wild beasts. But the bears and dogs are only responding to cues from their owners, not generating the rhythm themselves, research suggests. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">W. Tecumseh Fitch, a biologist and cognitive scientist at the University of Vienna, who was not involved in the research, but who won the earlier bet, strongly believes that musicality has a biological basis. The obvious pleasure derived from music generates by both humans and animals like Snowball supports that belief, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Really what the bird seems to be doing is playing around,” Dr. Fitch said. “He’s not just doing this stereotyped robotic thing. He’s actually experimenting.”</p>',\n",

But do they? This is the first in a series in which The Times is going back to the scene of major news events to see if those promises were kept.</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After Colombia’s government signed a peace deal with the country’s main rebel group, ending decades of war and upheaval, both sides said it heralded a new era. But two and a half years after the militants agreed to lay down their arms, many of the promises made are not being honored, and the prospect of a true, lasting peace now seems far from certain.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This is what we found:</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">As many as 3,000 militants have resumed fighting, threatening the very foundation of the accord.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Many of the millions of Colombians who once lived in rebel-held territory still await the promised arrival of roads, schools and electricity. The government’s pledge to help rural areas was a big reason the rebels stood down.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Since the peace deal was signed, at least 500 activists and community leaders have been killed, and more than 210,000 people displaced from their homes amid the continuing violence. That undercuts a core selling point of the deal: that it would bring safety and stability.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Colombia’s new president, Iván Duque, a conservative who took office in August, has expressed skepticism of the accords <!-- -->and wants to change a commitment that was fundamental to the rebels agreeing to lay down their weapons. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Colombia’s five-decade civil war took at least 220,000 lives and devastated large swaths of the countryside. In rebel-held areas, government services disappeared and the infrastructure crumbled. Many turned to the drug economy to survive.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">All sides were accused of atrocities — kidnappings, rapes and summary executions — that bred deep-seated animosities across the country and even within families. In a war so deeply personal, finding a way out posed an enormous challenge.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So when the government and the largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/world/americas/colombia-farc-peace-agreement.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">reached a peace agreement</a> in September 2016 after years of negotiation, much of the world applauded. Juan Manuel Santos, then Colombia’s president, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/world/americas/nobel-peace-prize-juan-manuel-santos-colombia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">won the Nobel Peace Prize</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But peace deals of this scope are never easy to implement, and Colombians knew a long, daunting path was ahead of them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The deal the two sides reached was ambitious and complex — with 578 separate stipulations — but it can be boiled down to a few core promises. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A primary goal of the FARC insurgency was improving the lives of rural Colombians. The deal calls for “universal” education in rural areas for preschool through secondary school; guaranteed access to drinking water; and heavy subsidies for development programs in former rebel territories.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rebels, in turn, would cease all hostilities, turn in their weapons to the United Nations and return to civilian life. The FARC would be allowed to compete in elections and was guaranteed 10 seats in Congress.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[The head of Colombia’s army has ordered</em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/americas/colombian-army-killings.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> increased attacks on criminals and rebel groups</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Much of the war was fought in the countryside.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The peace agreement raised hopes that the rural deprivation that fueled the conflict might finally ease. But two years after the accord was signed, a visit to the town of Juan José made clear that little has changed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The community of 8,000 has not received even the most basic services it was promised. With no running water, residents are still forced to rely on untreated wells. No schools have been built in the surrounding villages, despite government pledges, and many children have never seen the inside of a classroom.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the police are now in Juan José, neither they nor the military have made it to the nearby villages, and new armed groups have moved in to fill the vacuum left by the FARC. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Emilio Archila, an adviser to the government, said many of the biggest development promises in the agreement — such as delivering water and electricity — would take more than a decade to accomplish, <!-- -->given<!-- --> the damage the countryside suffered from the conflict. “Anyone who thinks we could solve these issues in two years doesn’t understand the magnitude of the problem,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Adam Isacson, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group, said the government had failed to act. “The government had a window of opportunity to establish the state in lands the rebels gave up, but it didn’t take that chance,” he said. “Now there are many groups fighting for the same territory.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Money is a major obstacle to meeting all the promises.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the peace deal was signed, the estimate was that it would cost about $45 billion to fulfill all the promises over a period of at least 15 years. At the time, the government enjoyed revenue from a state oil company whose output was going for almost $100 a barrel. Now, prices are a third lower.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Much of the FARC’s funding came through the drug trade. But peace did little to make farmers rethink their business model: Last year, the amount of land used for coca leaf production reached an all-time high.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Part of the problem is that the appeal of the lucrative cocaine business is as strong to the armed groups that have swept into rural areas as it once was to the FARC.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the government also bears much of the blame.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The crop-substitution program agreed to in the peace deal promised cash payments to those who uprooted their coca plants and replaced them with legal crops. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But in Juan José, residents say the payments to farmers ceased for a time after President Duque took charge. They eventually resumed at the end of the year, but the officials who were supposed to introduce the alternative crops never arrived.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So many farmers have gone back to planting coca.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A central pillar of the accords was a promise to seek the truth of what happened during the conflict, with the goal of national reconciliation. The deal established the so-called Special Jurisdiction for Peace — tribunals to hear accounts of crimes and abuses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ten thousand former rebels and 2,000 members of the armed forces pledged to testify under a broad blanket of immunity: Blame could be assigned, but no jail time would be handed out, except for a few select crimes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That part of the peace deal, however, was a tough sell for many Colombians. In October 2016, when they were given a chance to weigh in on the accord, they shocked many by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/world/colombia-peace-deal-defeat.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">voting against it</a> in a referendum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Santos sidestepped voters with <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/world/americas/colombia-farc-accord-juan-manuel-santos.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a revised deal</a> that he sent straight to Congress.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, Mr. Duque has requested an overhaul of the tribunals, calling them too lenient. Some worry he hopes to dismantle them entirely.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the no-jail pledge was critical to getting the FARC to sign the deal. Reneging on it might well be seen as a bait and switch.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And that could be a deal breaker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The ability to get a lighter sentence and participate in politics is what convinced the FARC to get into politics to begin with,” said Mr. Isacson, the human rights analyst.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some of the promises made in the peace accords have been kept. More than <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.wola.org/analysis/5-ways-united-states-can-support-colombia-peace-process/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">6,804 FARC fighters did initially disarm</a>,<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong>and more than <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://unmc.unmissions.org/en/un-mission-finalizes-activities-neutralization-farc-ep-armament\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">8,994 weapons were surrendered</a>.<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong>By 2017, the FARC had completely demobilized, except for a small dissident group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About 23 percent of the 578 provisions in the deal have been fully carried out, according to a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://kroc.nd.edu/news-events/news/second-kroc-institute-report-shows-steady-progress-of-peace-accord-implementation-in-colombia/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">recent study</a> by the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, which is monitoring the accords.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the study projected that despite the “steady progress,” only one-third of the commitments made in the deal would be met in the agreed-upon time frame. The rest, it said, were either in a “state of minimal implementation” or had not yet even been touched.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s undeniable that the government hasn’t made good on its promises, whether it’s reintegrating former fighters, agrarian development or political reforms,” said Julián Gallo Cubillos, a former FARC commander who is now a Colombian senator. “There’s been a general neglect.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the biggest failures has come on the security front, which government officials and rebels alike assured skeptical Colombians would be the largest dividend of the peace deal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In many areas where the FARC has disarmed, the government has yet to arrive in force, breaking a key promise of the accords.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The resulting lawlessness and disorder in rural areas <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/world/americas/colombia-farc-government-war.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">have proved deadly for Colombian activists</a>, 252 of whom were killed last year, up from 191 in 2017, according to Colombia’s Institute of Studies for Peace and Development.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The FARC said this month that 130 of its former fighters had been killed since the signing of the peace deal. The ex-rebels have repeatedly complained that demobilizing has left them defenseless against the paramilitary gangs still roaming the countryside.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This has led to a major setback for peace: Experts estimate that as many as 3,000 militants <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/world/americas/colombia-farc-peace.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">have taken up arms again</a> — a figure equal to more than 40 percent of those who initially demobilized.

       " 'colombian-army-killings': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">BOGOTÁ, Colombia — The head of Colombia’s army, frustrated by the nation’s faltering efforts to secure peace, has ordered his troops to double the number of criminals and militants they kill, capture or force to surrender in battle — and possibly accept higher civilian casualties in the process, according to written orders and interviews with senior officers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the start of the year, Colombian generals and colonels were assembled and told to sign a written pledge to step up attacks. Daily internal presentations now show the number of days that brigades have gone without combat, and commanders are berated when they don’t carry out assaults frequently enough, the officers said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One order causing particular worry instructs soldiers not to “demand perfection” in carrying out deadly attacks, even if significant questions remain about the targets they are striking. Some officers say that order has instructed them to lower their standards for protecting innocent civilians from getting killed, and that it has already led to suspicious or unnecessary deaths.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The military tried a similar strategy to defeat Colombia’s rebel and paramilitary groups in the mid-2000s, before a landmark peace deal was signed to end decades of conflict.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the tactics caused a national outrage when it emerged that soldiers, aiming to meet their quotas, engaged in widespread <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/world/americas/29iht-colombia.4.17352270.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">killings and disappearances of civilians</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, another incarnation of the policy is being pushed by the new government against the country’s remaining criminal, guerrilla and paramilitary groups, according to orders reviewed by The New York Times and three senior officers who spoke about them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/americas/colombia-farc-peace-deal.html?module=inline\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/americas/colombia-farc-peace-deal.html\" title=\"\">[Read more about why the peace deal is fraying.]</a></a></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new orders have sent a chill down the ranks of the army. Colombia’s military remains under investigation for the series of illegal killings in the mid-2000s, known as “false positives.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Soldiers repeatedly killed peasants and claimed they were guerrilla fighters, sometimes even dressing them in fatigues and planting weapons near their bodies. The tactics stemmed from superiors demanding increased body counts, prosecutors say.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two of the officers said in lengthy interviews that Colombian soldiers were under intense pressure yet again — and that a pattern of suspicious killings and cover-ups had begun to emerge this year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a meeting recounted by one of the officers, a general ordered commanders to “do anything” to boost their results, even if it meant “allying ourselves” with armed criminal groups to get information on targets, a divide-and-conquer strategy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Beyond that, officers said, soldiers who increase their combat kills are being offered incentives, like extra vacation, in a pattern they fear is strikingly similar to the unlawful killings of the mid-2000s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have gone back to what we were doing before,” said one of the officers, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals by their superiors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Major Gen. Nicacio Martínez Espinel, the top commander of Colombia’s army, acknowledged issuing the new orders and having officers set concrete goals for killing, capturing or forcing criminal groups and militants to surrender.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said he had issued the written order that instructed top commanders to “double the results” because of the threat that Colombia continues to face from guerrilla, paramilitary and criminal organizations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The criminal threat rose,” he said. “If we continued at the pace that we were going at, we would not have completed our objectives.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, the general disputed how officers have interpreted his instructions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The orders are that you are operationally effective,” he said. “Some told me they wanted a 10 percent increase, good, you do 10 percent. Some told me they wanted a 50 percent increase, but with no dead. Some said, ‘I want a 100 percent increase.’ There are some who have kept their word, and others that haven’t been able to.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He also acknowledged that the orders tell commanders to conduct operations when they are still uncertain about their targets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">However, General Martínez argued that the instructions referred only to planning missions, not to carrying them out.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Respect for human rights is the most important thing,” he said. “Everything has taken place within the letter of the law.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the order itself says, “You must launch operations with 60 to 70 percent credibility or exactitude” — leaving enough room for error that the policy has already led to questionable killings, two of the officers said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new orders signal an increase in military campaigns against guerrilla and paramilitary groups in Colombia, which reached a peace deal with the nation’s largest rebel group — the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC — just two years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Peace has been elusive. Many former guerrillas have returned to fighting, while other criminal and paramilitary groups have expanded their control over parts of the country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One rebel group that never signed a peace deal carried out a deadly car bombing in the capital in January.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Colombia is also under pressure from the Trump administration to show progress in cracking down on drug trafficking, a battle that has shown little progress despite $10 billion in American aid.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the pressure mounted, President Iván Duque, a conservative who campaigned against the peace deal because he thought it was too soft on the rebels, replaced the country’s top army commanders in December.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Duque’s government appointed nine officers linked to killings in the mid-2000s, including some who now hold top positions directing military offensives throughout Colombia, according to documents published by Human Rights Watch. One of the commanders linked to the killings, according to the rights group, is General Martínez<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">, </strong>who at the time held a mid-ranking position.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">General Martínez says he did not participate in any of the unlawful killings and that he is not under investigation by Colombia’s attorney general’s office.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The unlawful killings are a particularly contentious chapter in Colombia’s recent history. From 2002 to 2008, as many as 5,000 civilians or guerrillas were killed outside of combat, according to the United Nations. At least 1,176 members of the security forces have been convicted of crimes related to the illegal deaths, according to the government.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two of the officers who spoke to The Times said they had served during the killings and risen in rank through subsequent periods of reckoning and reform.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But a major shift took place, they say, when General Martínez called a meeting of his top officers in January, a month after assuming command of the army.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The meeting included the country’s top 50 generals and colonels, who met in a hangar in the mountains outside of Bogotá. Many were eager to hear whether there would be a new direction under the new leadership.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After a break, the commanders returned to tables where they found a form waiting for each one of them, the officers said. The form had the title “Goal Setting 2019” at the top and a place for each commander to sign at the bottom.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The form asked commanders to list the “arithmetic sum of surrenders, captures and deaths” of various armed groups for the previous year in one column, and then provide a goal for the following year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some of the commanders seemed confused — until they were instructed to double their numbers this year, the officers said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Soon afterward, the same order appeared from General Martínez, this time in writing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The goal is to double the operational results at all levels of command,” read the orders, which included his signature.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Three days after the meeting near Bogotá, a group of military intelligence officers and regional commanders were convened in the city of Cúcuta, on the border with Venezuela, the officers said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the meeting, the officers said, they were told, “We have to do anything now,” including using illegal paramilitary groups to provide information on rival armed groups “in order to get results.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The suggestion of working with one armed group to defeat another created a hush among the people there, said one of the officers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Feb. 19, a new document titled “50 Command Orders” emerged. One order demanded “opportune and massive strikes” against the enemy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the instructions on the threshold required for ordering deadly attacks were the largest shift from previous policy, the officers said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the past, they argued, military operations needed to be carried out with at least 85 percent of certainty of the target, after a series of meetings between commanders and intelligence agents to approve a strike. The new order called for a lower standard.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Soon after, the officers said they began identifying suspicious killings or arrests.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the officers cited the killing of what an army report called the death on Feb. 23 of a member of the paramilitary group Clan del Golfo. The report said that three members of the group had fought an army platoon, and that the fight ended in one death and two arrests. A pistol and revolver were found with the men.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The report was provided to The Times by the officer. He found it unlikely that three lightly armed criminals would combat an entire platoon of 41 men.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Perhaps the most disputed killing since General Martínez took command occurred around April 22, when the body of Dimar Torres, a former guerrilla who had disarmed under the peace deal, was found outside a village near the Venezuelan border.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Cellphone video circulated by villagers showed Mr. Torres’s body shot through the head. Villagers could be heard screaming epithets against paramilitary groups.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It turned out Mr. Torres was killed by the army. Colombia’s defense minister, Guillermo Botero, at first defended the shooting by saying Mr. Torres had been killed during a struggle over a weapon with a soldier. But days later, the general in charge of the region offered a public apology.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">José del Carmen Abril, a peasant leader in the village, said townspeople had found soldiers near Mr. Torres’s body trying to “dig a grave to make him disappear” that night. Cellphone video showed soldiers near a half-dug grave.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The officers said they had also been told that the soldiers were trying to hide Mr. Torres’s body. While the case has become a national controversy, the officers said that other killings were likely to go unnoticed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They produced a copy of a slide from a February presentation with the title “Days Without Combat.” It listed brigades and task forces, tallying how long each had gone without doing battle. The instructions were clear, they said: Increase kills, captures and surrenders.</p>',\n",

       " 'cutting-300-calories-a-day-shows-health-benefits': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Scientists have long known a fairly reliable way to extend life span in rodents and other lab animals: Reduce the amount of calories they eat by 10 percent to 40 percent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This strategy, known as caloric restriction, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/calorie-restriction-and-fasting-diets-what-do-we-know#animal\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">has been shown to increase the life span</a> of various organisms and reduce their rate of cancer and other age-related ailments. Whether it can do the same in people has been an open question. But an intriguing new study suggests that in young and middle-aged adults, chronically restricting calorie intake can have an impact on their health.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the new study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(19)30151-2/fulltext\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">published this month in the Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology</a>, researchers looked at a group of 143 healthy men and women who ranged in age<!-- --> from 21 to 50. T<!-- -->hey were instructed to practice caloric restriction for two years. They could eat the foods they wanted so long as they cut back on the total amount of food they ate, with the aim of cutting the calories they consumed by 25 percent. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many did not achieve that goal. On average, the dieters managed to slash about 12 percent of their total calories, or roughly 300 calories a day, the amount in a large bagel, a few chocolate chip cookies or a small Starbucks Mocha Frappuccino. But the group saw many of their cardiovascular and metabolic health markers improve, even though they were already in the normal range.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They lost weight and body fat. Their cholesterol levels improved, their blood pressure fell slightly, and they had better blood sugar control and less inflammation. At the same time, a control group of 75 healthy people who did not practice caloric restriction saw no improvements in any of these markers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some of the benefits in the calorie restricted group stemmed from the fact that they lost a large amount of weight, on average about 16 pounds over the two years of the study. But the extent to which their metabolic health got better was greater than would have been expected from weight loss alone, suggesting that caloric restriction might have some unique biological effects on disease pathways in the body, said William Kraus, the lead author of the study and a professor of medicine and cardiology at Duke University.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We weren’t surprised that there were changes,” he said. “But the magnitude was rather astounding. In a disease population, there aren’t five drugs in combination that would cause this aggregate of an improvement.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Calorie restriction may be a useful tool for better health and weight loss, but it’s unclear whether the changes in the new study will ultimately translate into longevity and reductions in chronic disease, said Frank Hu, the chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved in the research.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said the modest improvements experienced by the participants would have to be sustained over time to produce long-term benefits. But he questioned whether caloric restriction would be practical for most people given that “we are living in an obesogenic environment with an abundance of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods that are cheap, accessible and heavily marketed.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added, however, that some people might find calorie restriction feasible if they combined it with other popular dietary strategies like the Mediterranean diet, intermittent fasting or reduced carbohydrate intake.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new study provided evidence of just how difficult calorie restriction can be. The study participants went through an intensive training program where they learned to cook low-calorie meals, attended group sessions and had regular check-ins with nutrition experts. Still, they were not able to meet even half the goal of a 25 percent cut in calories. And as anyone who has dieted knows, keeping the weight off long-term can be the hardest part.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, the new study was groundbreaking in several ways. Funded entirely by the N.I.H. at a cost of $55 million and called Calerie — for Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy — it was the first major clinical trial to examine the effects of caloric restriction in a group of middle-aged or younger adults who were either normal weight or just slightly overweight but not obese. The goal of the trial was to look at whether caloric restriction could influence healthy aging and disease.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the calorie target they set was steep, they did give the subjects some flexibility, allowing them to eat the foods that they wanted. What they found was that the subjects did not change their protein intake, but they did eat significantly less fat and slightly fewer carbohydrates. They also consumed more micronutrients like vitamins A, K and magnesium, indicating a big increase in fruits and vegetables, said Susan B. Roberts, a co-author of the study and a senior scientist at the U.S.D.A. Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They were eating more healthy foods,” she said. “Things like nuts, whole grains, green vegetables and legumes.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For many people, dieting can be an unpleasant experience. But the researchers found that for many of the subjects, caloric restriction was surprisingly not unbearable. While more people dropped out of the diet group than the control group, the study overall had a high retention rate. The researchers looked at measures of quality of life and discovered that the calorie-restricted group reported <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27136347\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">better sleep, increased energy and improved mood</a>. Compared to the control group, they did not have significant increases in hunger or food cravings either, Dr. Roberts said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There was nothing we measured that indicated that they weren’t doing well,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One question the study could not answer was whether caloric restriction could extend life span in humans the way that it can in other animals. The researchers would have to keep people on the diet and follow them for many decades to test that.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But ultimately, caloric restriction did have a beneficial impact on a wide range of risk factors for diabetes and heart disease, two conditions that cause death and disability for millions of Americans, especially as they get older.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Kraus at Duke said he hoped to study the participants again in 10 years to see if the benefits of the caloric restriction experiment persist, a phenomenon known as legacy effects, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/well/move/10-years-after-an-exercise-study-benefits-persist.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">which can occur with intense exercise training</a> and other health interventions. But for now, he said that one takeaway for the public is that people can benefit from shaving as little as 300 calories a day from their diets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s not that hard to achieve that amount of caloric restriction,” he said. “That’s essentially an after-dinner snack.”</p>',\n",

It was an appealing pitch for industrial farms, where crowded, germ-prone conditions have led to increasing reliance on drug interventions. The pamphlets also detailed how <!-- -->feeding pigs a daily regimen of two antibiotics<!-- --> would make them fatter and, as any farmer understands, a heavier pig is a more profitable pig. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rise of drug-resistant germs, caused by overuse of antibiotics, is one of the world’s most nettlesome health predicaments. Excessive use of the medicines has allowed germs to develop defenses against them, rendering a growing number of drugs ineffective for people and animals. The practices of livestock farmers, who for decades have used huge quantities of the drugs deemed important to humans, have long been viewed as one of the roots of the problem, but the role of the companies that make the drugs has received less scrutiny.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Antibiotics continue to be an important part of the business of companies like Elanco, which spun off from Eli Lilly in September, its share price soaring to $33 from $24. While Elanco is developing antibiotic alternatives for animals, like vaccines and enzymes, the antibiotics promoted by the Pig Zero campaign are exactly the kinds that global public health officials are trying to curb. And Elanco is no outlier — its rivals are also urging aggressive use of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190604015203/https://www.zoetisus.com/products/beef/bovatec.aspx?_ga=2.127535694.216929652.1537192460-1078237251.1536078211\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">their own antibiotic cocktails</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The reality is that antibiotics and large-scale industrial farming really grew up together,” said Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state epidemiologist and state public health veterinarian in Kansas, who sits on advisory boards addressing antibiotic resistance. She equated the problem with climate change. “By the time people understand and believe it,” Dr. Hansen said, “it may be too late.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Elanco had already been put on notice about the drugs used in <!-- -->its Pig Zero <!-- -->push. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration <!-- -->warned<!-- --> Novartis Animal Health, which had been acquired by Elanco, that the same antibiotic cocktail was “unsafe” and “misbranded,” because it was being illegally marketed to fatten pigs, rather than to simply treat disease.

Pig Zero trumpets the benefits of coupling tiamulin with chlortetracycline, a drug made by Elanco’s competitors that both American and international regulators consider <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/cia2017.pdf?ua=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">medically important</a> to humans. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an interview at Elanco’s headquarters outside Indianapolis, Jeffrey Simmons, the chief executive, said the company had decided to change the program’s marketing and to stop distributing the Pig Zero brochure after The New York Times began asking questions about it. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re trying to be stewards and leaders at the same time,” said Mr. Simmons, adding that the brochure “wasn’t misrepresentation, necessarily, relative to the label or the science, or how a farmer would look at it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. <!-- -->Shabbir Simjee<!-- -->, Elanco’s chief medical officer, said drugs like those in the campaign “would never be administered” in a herd “without some animals being physically sick,” adding that “there would need to be some animals showing clinical signs.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He likened treating a herd to caring for children in a nursery: “If one child gets sniffles, you usually find that the whole class ends up with a cold, and this is exactly the same principle.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But children almost certainly would not all be treated with preventive antibiotics in such a situation, and many scientists believe animals often should not be treated that way, either.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The connection of overuse of antibiotics in livestock to human health takes two paths: As bacteria develop defenses against drugs widely used in animals, those defense mechanisms can spread to other bacteria that infect humans; and, resistant germs are transmitted from livestock to humans — through undercooked meat, farm-animal feces seeping into waterways, waste lagoons that overflow after natural disasters like <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/climate/florence-hog-farms.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Hurricane Florence</a>, or when farm workers and others come into <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://oem.bmj.com/content/72/2/90\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">contact with animals</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">[Read other articles in our series <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/deadly-germs-lost-cures?module=inline\" title=\"\">Deadly Germs, Lost Cures</a>.]</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">New F.D.A. regulations put in effect in the waning days of the Obama administration prohibited farms from fattening livestock by lacing their feed with medically important antibiotics. The new rules, along with rising consumer demand for antibiotic-free meat, cut antibiotic use significantly in 2017. But such drugs <!-- -->are still routinely given to<!-- --> pigs <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/cattle-antiobiotics.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">and cattle</a>, accounting for almost 80 percent of medically important livestock antibiotics in the United States and nearly 5,000 tons of active ingredient. Worldwide use is projected to keep rising sharply as growing middle classes in places like China and Brazil demand more meat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ellen Silbergeld<!-- -->, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, who has worked with the W.H.O. on drug resistance, called the continuing promotion of the drugs by pharmaceutical companies “very dangerous.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The reason they’re doing it, though, is money, honey,” she added. “That’s what it’s all about. That’s what it’s always been about.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, the industry has an important ally in Washington: President Trump, who appointed one of Elanco’s former executives, Ted McKinney, as under secretary of agriculture for trade and foreign agricultural affairs. Mr. McKinney told international food safety regulators at a meeting last summer in Rome that they were too singularly focused on consumers, at the expense of pharmaceutical companies and research scientists working to meet growing global demand for food. “We have got to rededicate a focus on them as our customers,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2015, Mr. Simmons, Elanco’s chief executive, joined a White House summit meeting to pledge the company’s commitment to curbing antibiotic use.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sylvia M. Burwell<!-- -->, then the health and human services secretary, hailed the gathering as a “hopefully historic step to protect the health of our nation.” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the time, warned that antibiotic resistance “could result in the medicine chest being empty when we need it most.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Simmons outlined Elanco’s lofty aims. “We’re going to create antibiotic alternatives,” he said, adding, “We believe strongly that there are solutions, there are pipelines, there are options.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A farm boy from upstate New York, he was a nearly 30-year veteran of Eli Lilly when Elanco spun off last year with its 5,800 employees. His wife helps run a church food bank. Mr. Simmons sits in an unassuming cubicle on Elanco’s campus.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He refers to himself as a “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-simmons-4b352a1a/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">purpose-driven leader</a>” on a mission to fight hunger — echoing the megachurch founder Rick Warren’s best-selling book “The Purpose-Driven Life,” which Mr. Simmons has read and taken to heart. He uses social media to spread a sort of protein-affordability gospel: “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Protein?src=hash\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">#Protein</a> is a nutritious part of a balanced diet, but many don’t have access to it,” he <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffSimmons2050/status/679306402083418112\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">once wrote on Twitter</a>. “We can/must change this!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While microbiologists emphasize the urgency of fighting antibiotic resistance, agrochemical industry veterans like Mr. Simmons say it must be balanced against hunger and the world’s growing demand for food. He often recounts his time as an executive in Brazil, when an anguished guard in his gated community sought help <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1299&amp;context=rangebeefcowsymp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">feeding his two children</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m not doing it for a paycheck or profits,” Mr. Simmons said in an interview. “Purpose has to override that.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">(He does get a paycheck, though. His <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739104/000104746919000609/a2237775zs-4a.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">total compensation</a> was $5.4 million last year.) </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Financial disclosures for Elanco and its rival Zoetis, which spun off from Pfizer <!-- -->in 2013<!-- -->, show the two companies sell roughly $2 billion annually in livestock antibiotics. In Elanco’s case, antibiotic sales represent more than one-third of its overall business. Some antibiotics, like monensin, a top seller for Elanco, belong to a class not used in people, and thus are not considered a resistance threat. But so-called shared-class antibiotics, like chlortetracycline, are used in humans and animals, creating risk for resistant infections.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Simmons said that while Elanco “started as an antibiotic company,” antibiotics that are medically important for people and used in livestock feed now make up only 5 percent of its sales. “We’re not building our company on that 5 percent,” he said. But the company has also said that 12 percent of Elanco’s sales overall, including antibiotics used in feed and administered in other ways, come from medically important antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While consumer demand has made developing alternatives an industry imperative, few companies are eager to cede ground on existing business.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Del Holzer, who was the director of meat and poultry for Elanco’s global industry food team from 2012 to 2017, said the company and its competitors want to take positive steps and look good, to a point. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They want to do the right thing,” said Mr. Holzer, who now works for a division of the agriculture giant Cargill, an Elanco competitor that develops antibiotic alternatives. “But they say, ‘My bottom line is my shareholders will be really pissed at me.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When antibiotics were first discovered more than a century ago, no one intended them for animals. But then an American company, Lederle Laboratories, announced in 1950 that chickens grew faster when they were fed chlortetracycline, one of the drugs included in the Pig Zero campaign.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the early 1960s, almost half of livestock antibiotics were aimed at making animals fatter. Drugs were marketed by the barrel; a 50-pound chlortetracycline bag <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6140039-1972-Pfizer-and-Cyanamid.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">advertised</a> in 1972 in <!-- -->The Herald<!-- -->, in Jasper, Ind., cost $9.25.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A Purina Pig Chow ad that appeared in an Iowa newspaper in the early 1960s promised that it was “power packed with the potent vitamins, minerals and anti-biotics pigs need for fast growth and good health.” Another ad, in a Missouri paper, promoted “full-o-pep Pig Grower,” a feed laced with antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet scientists already had misgivings. In 1969, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldselect/ldsctech/081vii/st0706.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Swann Committee report</a>, commissioned by the British Parliament, concluded the problem of antibiotic resistance was significant. In 1976, a landmark study published in Nature found that resistant E. coli strains could be passed from chickens fed with antibiotics to other chickens, and then to farm workers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was pretty obvious to me that the prudent thing to do would be to take low levels of antibiotics out of animal feed,” said Dr. Hansen, the former state epidemiologist in Kansas. As an F.D.A. employee in 1978, she gathered evidence for Congress linking antibiotic use in livestock to resistant infections in humans, but no action was taken.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The science was there, the evidence was pretty easy,” she said. “It was a slam dunk.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The pharmaceutical industry has pushed back. In 1997, researchers from Elanco were among those who authored a lengthy <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2672.1997.00280.x\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">review</a> in the Journal of Applied Microbiology dismissing concerns about antibiotic use in animals, writing, “We are confronted by a lack of information, a wall of ignorance.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pharma companies kept a stranglehold on basic information. V<!-- -->arious <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2013/02/06/recordhigh-antibiotic-sales-for-meat-and-poultry-production\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">estimates</a> by academics and public policy groups claim<!-- --> as much as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://livablefutureblog.com/2010/12/new-fda-numbers-reveal-food-animals-consume-lion%E2%80%99s-share-of-antibiotics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">80 percent</a> of American antibiotic sales go to livestock.

By the time we understand the full magnitude of this threat, it may be too late.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There has been progress. In 2017, when the F.D.A. effectively banned the use of medically important antibiotics to fatten livestock, their consumption <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/UserFees/AnimalDrugUserFeeActADUFA/UCM628538.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">fell by a third</a> <!-- -->that year<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But health experts say the regulations did not go far enough and see a sleight of hand at work, with industry marketing now presenting routine antibiotic use as a “proactive” necessity and weight gain an ancillary benefit, as Elanco did in the Pig Zero marketing campaign.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before her death last year, Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a New York Democrat who was the only microbiologist serving in Congress, lamented the F.D.A.’s new rules as being riddled with loopholes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s useless,” she said of the regulations. “That’s why the industry’s supporting it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A recent tour of Elanco’s labs at its Indiana headquarters swept past a virology lab and a large machine analyzing the DNA of thousands of hamster cells. Amid beakers and hardware, scientists in coats and protective glasses discussed their efforts to find alternatives to antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Aaron Schacht, Elanco’s <!-- -->head of research and development<!-- -->, said those alternatives could include enhancing the animals’ own immune function, immunizing <!-- -->them<!-- --> against particular pathogens or reshaping their gut bacteria to favor the good ones.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Could we eliminate the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics? I think it’s possible,” he said. “Now let’s let the science play out.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But change comes in fits and starts. Mr. Holzer, the former Elanco official, said the drugmaker had created “country-specific websites” where “there were certain things you couldn’t talk about in the U.S., but then talk about in Poland.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a bit of a hypocritical thing,” he added. “Elanco wants to lead the charge on antibiotic use but then sells into these countries that could become the biggest part of the problem. The idea is that as long as we don’t lose antibiotics in country XYZ, we can take our hit in the U.S., and get the P.R. for it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Elanco called Mr. Holzer’s comments “completely inaccurate.” Colleen Dekker, a spokeswoman, said the company no longer included “growth promotion” — fattening up animals — as an approved use for medically important antibiotics worldwide, “regardless of what local regulations allow.” The company was also intentionally decreasing its sales of such drugs, she said, <!-- -->show<!-- -->ing that “this is far more than a ‘P.R. effort.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But for Pig Zero, the company sees a problem only in the marketing. Going forward, Ms. Dekker said, such drugs would be sold “more from a health perspective” than from “a weight-gain perspective.” Mr. Simmons said of The Times’s inquiries, “We had a lot of dialogue about Pig Zero that probably we wouldn’t have had,” adding, “That’s good.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p>',\n",

       " 'ebola-outbreak': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The year-old Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo is now considered a global health emergency, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday, in a formal declaration that many public health experts called long overdue.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is still a regional emergency and by no way a global threat,” said Robert Steffen of the University of Zurich, chairman of the W.H.O. emergency committee that recommended the declaration. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the panel was persuaded by several factors that have made <!-- -->combating the epidemic <!-- -->more urgent in recent weeks: <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/health/ebola-congo-outbreak.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">The disease reached Goma</a>, a city of nearly two million people; the outbreak has raged for a year; the virus has flared again in spots where it had once been contained; and the epidemic hot zone has geographically expanded in northeastern Congo near <!-- -->Rwanda and into Uganda.<!-- --> </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Violence against health workers has been a constant worry, and intensified after two Congolese workers were killed in their homes in Beni last week. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Officials are also dismayed by the persistence of the epidemic even with the extensive use of a successful vaccine. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This was the fourth time that the W.H.O. had considered whether to declare a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.who.int/features/qa/emergency-committees/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">global health emergency</a> in the Congo outbreak. It stopped short the first three times, even though some aid agencies and public health officials had called on the organization to do so in hopes such an order would elicit more funds and recruit more health workers to the region.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But government officials have repeatedly expressed competing concerns about interrupting trade or restricting travel, which Dr. Steffen emphasized should not result from the emergency status issued on Wednesday. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Emergency declarations are issued sparingly, reserved for outbreaks that pose a serious threat to public health and could spread to other countries. Only four such declarations have been made in the past: in 2009, for pandemic influenza; in 2014, for a polio resurgence in several countries; in 2014, for the Ebola epidemic in West Africa; and in 2016, for the Zika virus epidemic. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Congo outbreak began a year ago, with the first cases confirmed in August. As of Monday, the disease had infected 2,512 people and killed 1,676 of them. The virus has defied efforts to control its rampant spread in the northeastern part of the country, a conflict zone under unrelenting peril from warring militias.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> Dr. Tedros Adhanom <!-- -->Ghebreyesus<!-- -->, the director-general of the W.H.O., has described this outbreak as one of the world’s most dangerous viruses in one of the world’s most dangerous areas. Public health experts warn that the <!-- -->implacable<!-- --> spread of the virus means the outbreak could easily continue well into next year. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is the second largest Ebola outbreak in history <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/health/ebola-virus-facts.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">after the one in West Africa in 2014-15</a>, which infected 28,616 people and caused 11,310 deaths. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The decision on Wednesday was based <!-- -->on a vote by 11 members of an expert <!-- -->panel convened by Dr. Tedros to reassess the current outbreak after an<!-- --> infected man<!-- --> carried the virus to the city of Goma, a densely populated transportation hub close to Rwanda that has an international airport. That patient has died.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Global health groups had been calling for the declaration for months. Josie Golding of the Wellcome Trust, a research charity based in London, said in statement, “We commend the W.H.O. for making this tough decision, it is right to do so.” The public health response in Congo, she added, was “overstretched and underfunded.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Labeling the epidemic a global emergency will “help raise international support and release more resources — including finance, health care workers, enhanced logistics, security and infrastructure,” she predicted.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University, said in a statement: “Almost all international legal and policy experts agree that the conditions for declaring a public health emergency of international concern were met long ago, so we are delighted to see that the emergency committee and the director-general have finally come to this decision. Not only do we believe that the decision will help bring additional needed attention to this ongoing crisis, but also move nations in the regions to take all necessary steps to address the potential spread of the disease.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The executive director of Unicef, Henrietta Fore, said in a statement: “This is an emergency. There is a very real risk that the Ebola outbreak could spread to neighboring countries, so the international community should urgently come together to make sure that doesn’t happen.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The W.H.O. said it had received $49 million from international donors from February to July, only half the money it needs. Officials who have visited the region say supplies are running short, including the protective gear that health workers need to avoid becoming infected. At a United Nations meeting about the outbreak on Monday, one official said he had seen syringes and gloves being reused because equipment was becoming scarce.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Tedros said that emergency declarations were not meant to be used to raise money, and that the W.H.O. did not know of any donors who had withheld funds because no emergency had been declared. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“But if that is the excuse, it can no longer be used,” he said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More than 161,000 people have received an Ebola vaccine made by Merck that is considered highly effective. Concerns about the supply have led the W.HO. to recommend using smaller doses to keep from running out. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pamela L. Eisele, a spokeswoman for Merck, said in an email that Merck had donated more than 195,000 doses of the vaccine to the W.H.O. since last year, had 245,000 more ready to ship and expected to have 900,000 more in the next six to 18 months. It takes about a year to produce a batch of the vaccine, she said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The W.H.O. and other experts have advocated the use of a second vaccine as well, made by Johnson &amp; Johnson. But Congo’s Ministry of Health has declined it, saying that the Merck vaccine is known to work, and that it is the only one the nation’s citizens, after a period of mistrust and suspicion, have come to accept. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Michael Ryan, the executive director for W.H.O.’s health emergencies program, said, “W.H.O. still supports the introduction of a second vaccine.” He added that the agency was discussing it with officials in Congo. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The man who brought the disease to Goma <!-- -->was<!-- --> a pastor who had preached in seven churches in the epidemic zone, laying hands on the sick. He became ill and was treated by a nurse, but got on a bus to Goma anyway. The bus stopped at three checkpoints meant to halt the spread of the disease by screening passengers for symptoms, but his illness was not detected. He gave a different name at each checkpoint, apparently hoping to avoid being detained, local health authorities said. Sick and feverish by the time he arrived in Goma, he went to a clinic there, where the disease was diagnosed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He was the only patient in the Goma clinic, which was disinfected after his visit. Health authorities have been tracking the 18 other bus passengers and the driver, as well as others who might have been exposed to the disease by the pastor, and providing vaccinations. So far, 257 people — contacts of the pastor, and their contacts — have been vaccinated. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Steffen said the emergency declaration should not be seen as a criticism of the efforts already made to stop the epidemic.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The rationale is to better cope with the volatile characteristics of this outbreak,” he said. “The strategy is not to be changed.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> </p>',\n",

       " 'el-chapo-mexico': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the bloody churn of the global drug trade, there are no fixed, permanent characters. Cartel leaders are seldom more than temporary players, rising and falling with unfailing predictability as a new cast rushes in to replace them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So it goes even with Joaquin Guzman Loera, the infamous drug lord known as El Chapo, who was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/el-chapo-sentencing.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">sentenced to life in prison</a> on Wednesday in New York for smuggling tons of drugs into the United States and leaving a trail of death in his wake.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The sentencing was the final act for Mr. Guzman, a poor farm boy who turned a small-time drug racket into <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/world/americas/arrest-unlikely-to-break-cartel.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">one of the largest, and most violent, criminal enterprises</a> in history. His trajectory was one of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/world/americas/joaquin-guzman-loera-el-chapo-mexican-drug-kingpin-prison-escape.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Houdini-like escapes from prison</a>, mountains of cash and bottomless blood lust.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For nearly 20 years, his story <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/world/americas/safe-haven-for-drug-kingpin-el-chapo-in-many-mexicans-hearts.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">loomed large in Mexico</a> and around the world, a remarkable stretch of time for him to bask in the dubious glow of being the most recognized drug lord in the world.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, Mr. Guzman’s legacy will fade behind the walls of a maximum-security prison, along with the dozens of other cartel leaders already confined to history.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But for all the public fanfare of his downfall — the pursuit through the mountains of the Sierra Madre, the narrow escapes under the noses of federal authorities, the jubilation at <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/world/americas/mexico-el-chapo-sinaloa-sean-penn.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">his final made-for-TV capture</a> — the larger narrative of the drug war remains unbroken.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many here in Mexico would argue, in fact, that the war has only grown worse since his extradition. And judging by the staggering homicide figures of the last few years, which continue to set records, it is easy to see why.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are experiencing so much violence,” said José Luis Córdoba, 47, who works at a private security company in Mexico City. “So, no, it definitely won’t stop or change because he got sentenced to life in prison.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Kingpins fall, new ones rise, and the traffic of drugs to the United States continues uninterrupted. Through it all, the death toll mounts, especially in Mexico, where the majority of the blood is spilled.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The lives lost in the violence have now surpassed the levels reached when Mr. Guzman was on the street, overseeing a vast empire of killers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Taking out the drug trade’s most dangerous leaders has not ended the trafficking. It has been all but proven that the so-called Kingpin Strategy pushed by the United States — in which the authorities try to cripple drug cartels by going after their leaders — has failed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Instead of destroying the cartels by cutting off their heads, the policy has spawned multi-headed hydras, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/13/world/americas/as-mexico-arrests-kingpins-cartels-splinter-and-violence-spikes.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">smaller, less disciplined and often-deadlier spinoffs</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Unfortunately, Mexico does not have the capacity to deal with the splintering of the cartel and the vast network that is the Sinaloa Cartel,” said Giovanni Márquez, 27, a Mexican economist, referring to Mr. Guzman’s cartel. “At the end, it’s not great news for us.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So one of the grand disappointments of Mr. Guzman’s capture is that it has been a major catalyst of the violence consuming Mexico.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before his capture, his Sinaloa cartel was the dominant player in the drug market. With fewer enemies to kill off, homicides were on a downward glide path until 2014.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But after his capture, the struggle to challenge Sinaloa’s dominance of the business has intensified, helping fuel a war for control.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Mexico, a new force has emerged in the drug trade, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, and it is in a fight with others for dominance of the trade routes through Mexico into the United States. Homicides are surging in all of the predictable hot spots, including Acapulco, Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But they are also spiking in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/world/americas/mexicos-drug-killings.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">previously quiet areas</a>, like in the coastal state of Colima.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is precisely because he was removed from the game that we are seeing the level of violence we are seeing now,” said David Shirk, a professor at the University of San Diego and director of the Justice in Mexico program there. “Had he remained at large, and the organization continued to dominate the drug trade as they were in 2013 and 2014, we might have seen a decline to some of the lowest levels of violence in Mexico’s history.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, analysts said it was important to jail leaders like Mr. Guzman, who drugged and abused girls as young as 13-years-old while at the helm of his organization, according to trial testimony.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In the long term, not pursuing leaders sends a message of impunity,” said Jorge Chabat, a security expert at the University of Guadalajara.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But his capture has done nothing to dampen violence, or even reduce the overdose deaths plaguing the United States, experts said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is almost like a Pyrrhic victory,” said Tony Payan, the director of the Mexico Center at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice Unviersity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The fundamental underlying dynamics of the war on drugs have remained the same for going on half a century,” Mr. Shirk added. “I don’t want to call it a futile struggle, but what else can you call it?”</p>',\n",

       " 'faceapp-old-privacy': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A developer could not have asked for better publicity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This week<!-- -->, two years after being widely panned for a filter that critics described as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/10/faceapp-forced-to-pull-racist-filters-digital-blackface\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">little more than “digital blackface,”</a> FaceApp, a photo-altering smartphone app, found itself at the center of a popular social media challenge.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A range of celebrities had been using the app’s age filter to modify photographs of themselves and provide realistic glimpses of what they could look like decades in the future. But then the backlash started.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">When you take a trip to the Year 3000. <a href=\"https://t.co/O9Dxpwj6ex\">pic.twitter.com/O9Dxpwj6ex</a></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The app, which was created by Wireless Lab of St. Petersburg, Russia, and was ranking among the top free offerings in both the Apple and Android app stores on Wednesday, was uploading much more data than users realized, one Twitter user contended in a widely shared, since deleted post. “Russians now own all your old photos,” <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-security-concerns-russians-now-own-all-your-old-photos/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">The New York Post proclaimed in a headline</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Wednesday afternoon, the Democratic National Committee even sent out an alert, urging staff members on presidential campaigns to delete the app immediately, citing its ties to Russia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But at least some of those concerns are overblown, according to several security researchers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The info sent by the application was only my device model, my device ID and Android version, which is very limited information and is quite common for an application,” said <!-- -->Baptiste Robert<!-- -->, a <!-- -->French<!-- --> security researcher who specializes in smartphone apps that abuse user data<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Robert did find one other piece of data uploaded to FaceApp servers without user consent, though: the photograph that a user wanted to manipulate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The program says that its three age filters — two for younger-looking images, one for older — use “artificial intelligence” to produce plausible alterations to existing photos. Celebrities who have shared such manipulated images of themselves include Drake, Gordon Ramsay, the Jonas Brothers and Dwyane Wade.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The company did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but it explained how the software works in a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/faceapp-responds-to-privacy-concerns/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">lengthy statement</a> published on Wednesday by TechCrunch. When a user of the app selects a photograph to alter, that image — and only that image — is uploaded to FaceApp servers for processing, it said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We might store an uploaded photo in the cloud,” the statement read. “The main reason for that is performance and traffic: We want to make sure that the user doesn’t upload the photo repeatedly for every edit operation. Most images are deleted from our servers within 48 hours from the upload date.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">FaceApp does not sell or share user data with third parties, the company said, though it reserves the right to share some information as outlined in its privacy policy. According to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://faceapp.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">that agreement</a>, the app uses “third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even though its research-and-development team is based in Russia, the company said that user data was not transferred there. Photo processing is performed on servers operated by Amazon and Google, FaceApp’s founder, Yaroslav Goncharov, told TechCrunch.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a letter on Wednesday, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, asked both the F.B.I. and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the app, citing “serious concerns” about security, data retention and transparency.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It would be deeply troubling if the sensitive personal information of U.S. citizens was provided to a hostile foreign power actively engaged in cyber hostilities against the United States,” he wrote.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Ivan Rodriguez, a software engineer at Google who in his free time investigates suspicious iOS apps, including FaceApp, said he found little cause for concern. Like Mr. Robert, he found that the app collected little identifiable data beyond the photos users chose to alter.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I don’t understand where these ‘fears’ come from, other than the parent company being based in Russia,” he said in a <!-- -->Twitter <!-- -->exchange. “I mean, I definitely don’t have the resources the F.B.I. or even the F.T.C. have, but so far I haven’t found anything that’s alarming or that shows this app trying to hide functionality that can be harmful.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Like many other applications, FaceApp uses <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/fs0c131y/status/1151267990542999556\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">services provided to developers by Facebook and Google</a>, known as Application Programming Interfaces, according to Mr. Robert. And although he was disappointed by the rapid spread of misinformation about what the program collected, he said, he was pleased by the impulse behind it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m quite happy, to be honest, because people are starting to be interested by this kind of question,” Mr. Robert said, “and they start to understand that, O.K., maybe there are some privacy concerns.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, he noted, such concerns often take a back seat to novelty. “The cool factor is working a lot,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Robert and two other researchers who investigated the issue all said they had found no evidence on Apple or Android phones that FaceApp was secretly uploading entire photo galleries. But each voiced concern that the app, like many others, failed to alert users that their data was being uploaded to remote servers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If they don’t take privacy seriously, how seriously do they take security?” asked Will Strafach, the founder and chief executive of Guardian Firewall, a tool coming soon for iOS that aims to give users more control over their data. “If they don’t take security seriously, what’s the risk of either an insider threat or their company being breached?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Others online raised concerns about FaceApp’s privacy policy and terms and conditions, citing, among other things, a clause that grants FaceApp extensive rights to user photographs. But Jeremy Gillula, tech projects director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit civil liberties group, said it was similar to those of other apps.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We always have concerns,” he said. “The fact that a lot of apps and services usually contain this catchall clause that says you grant us worldwide license to reproduce, modify, adapt, create derivative works from, distribute, publicly perform and display your user content always seems a little over the top to me.”</p>',\n",

       " 'facebook-libra-house-hearing': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lawmakers said in a House hearing on Wednesday that Facebook’s plan to enter the world of cryptocurrency and global finance could threaten sovereign currencies or even destabilize governments.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A day after a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/facebook-libra-congress.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">similarly critical Senate hearing</a>, it was the House Financial Services Committee’s turn. David Marcus, a Facebook executive, faced over four hours of questions about Facebook’s plans for a cryptocurrency called Libra. As was the case on Tuesday, Mr. Marcus was dogged by his company’s controversial reputation as well as skepticism of the legal uses of cryptocurrencies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is the biggest thing this committee will deal with this decade,” said Representative Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California. “This is a godsend to drug dealers and tax evaders.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Facebook announced Libra in June, it said it wanted to create a new global financial system. The initiative, if successful, could put digital wallets in the hands of the more than two billion people who use Messenger and WhatsApp, the messaging platforms owned by Facebook.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The antagonism toward Facebook’s Libra effort is part of a broader escalation of criticism of tech giants in Washington, which was on full display in a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/big-tech-antitrust-hearing.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">series of hearings on Tuesday</a>. Even before Facebook announced its intentions to move into the financial system, the company had battled concerns that it had grown too powerful.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think before you move on to Libra, you ought to clean up the messes of the past,” Representative Madeleine Dean, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, said at the hearing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Libra also faces doubts from regulators around the world. On Wednesday, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, Gita Gopinath, told reporters that she was concerned that Libra could unfairly increase the influence of the dollar in the global economy while also making money laundering more easy, according to a Reuters report.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the Senate hearing about Libra on Tuesday focused on the widespread mistrust of Facebook, House committee members showed more interest in the many practical hurdles that are likely to confront Facebook if it wants to release Libra next year, as it has said it wants to do.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Facebook’s plans raise serious privacy, trading and monetary policy concerns,” said Representative Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the committee and a Democrat from California. The system will “yield immense economic power that could destabilize government.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Waters said she was working on new legislation that would make it illegal for big tech companies to get involved in the financial industry, which could stop Libra in its tracks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Marcus, the executive overseeing Calibra, the Facebook subsidiary working on the project, struck a conciliatory tone for a second day and said Facebook was listening to its critics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I believe we are owning these mistakes and working to remedy them,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Republicans on the committee were more eager to talk about the benefits that might come from Libra, but they also expressed their concern about Facebook’s plan.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Quite frankly, I don’t care for Facebook,” said Representative Barry Loudermilk, a Republican from Georgia. “But I do appreciate anyone who challenges the status quo.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Several Republicans asked if Facebook could stop people from using Libra in the way that it has closed the accounts of controversial political figures like the conservative commentator Milo Yiannopoulos.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I don’t know,” Mr. Marcus said, emphasizing the basic uncertainties that still face the currency.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Facebook has designed Libra so that it can be governed by dozens of big corporate partners, organized through a Swiss nonprofit. This is supposed to reduce Facebook’s power over the currency, but it led to questions on Wednesday about how much power American regulators would have if governance of the system was not taking place in the United States.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Facebook has said that Libra would be backed by several different traditional currencies, held in bank accounts. House committee members expressed concern that this could expose consumers to the risks of currency fluctuations, and might reduce the power of the dollar.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Tell me how Libra will not undermine sovereign currencies and central banks, or is the very point to undermine central bankers and to provide a greater freedom away from central banking?” asked Representative Andy Barr, a Republican from Kentucky.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Marcus argued that Libra was not an attempt to take on traditional currencies or the Federal Reserve.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I want to be very clear, we do not want to compete with the dollar or sovereign currencies,” Mr. Marcus said at the hearing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Mr. Marcus also did not back down on Libra’s big ambitions: “We would like for Libra to be a digital, global currency, and to be one unit of digital currency for the whole world.”</p>',\n",

It comes from Boswellia, a genus of trees and shrubs endemic to the Horn of Africa, Arabian Peninsula and parts of India.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When frankincense tappers make gashes into some species of mature Boswellia’s woody skin, sap seeps out like blood from a wound. It dries into a scab of resin, which is harvested and sold raw, or turned into oil or incense.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Frankincense is exported by the thousands of<!-- --> tons<!-- --> each year. But as demand increases, <!-- -->over-exploitation<!-- --> and ecosystem degradation are bringing populations to the brink of collapse. The study’s authors estimate that without new trees to replace the old, half the intact forests — and half the frankincense they produce — will be gone within 20 years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To find out its status, Dr. Bongers and colleagues surveyed <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/taxonomydetail.aspx?id=310554#Economic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Boswellia papyrifera</a> — the species responsible for most of the world’s frankincense — in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Darfur. The trees were old and dying, and most hadn’t produced a young tree in half a century. Models suggested that with no intervention, populations would collapse. Other Boswellia species face similar threats.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The problem, they found, was more people. They burn forests for agriculture and allow livestock that eat saplings to graze in forests. And increasing demand has incentivized poor tree tappers, who make only a tiny percentage of frankincense profit and rely on it for income, to take as much resin as they can in a short amount of time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That leaves overtapped trees that are weak and vulnerable to pests and early death before a new generation can replace them. Despite adult trees producing plenty of seeds, researchers seldom found any new saplings, let alone newly matured trees. Others are too weak to produce enough quality seeds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But it’s not hopeless, Dr. Bonger said. Populations can be restored by planting more trees, ceasing burning and building fences to block livestock. Sustainable tapping regulations should be created, taught and enforced, he added, and international trade limited. Buyers at all levels of the supply chain should emphasize quality and sustainable harvesting over quantity to reduce overtapping. And consumers can continue demanding sustainable, socially conscious products.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.uvm.edu/ieds/node/284\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Anjanette DeCarlo</a>, an environmentalist at the University of Vermont, who was not involved in the study, has <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2017/04/20/inside-africa-tracking-down-the-frankincense-tree-in-somalia-c.cnn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">worked with frankincense in Somaliland</a>.

With golf’s oldest major championship returning to McDowell’s Northern Ireland hometown for the first time in 68 years, he was clawing to get in.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Fortunately for McDowell, it never came down to his last chance, which would have been the Scottish Open if St. Annes had not worked out. He found an entry via Canada, grabbing one of three berths through the RBC Canadian Open by making a 30-foot par putt on the final hole in June.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pressure removed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It would have been incredibly bittersweet not to have been at the Open Championship,” said McDowell, 39, who learned the game at Royal Portrush along with the neighboring Rathmore Golf Club. His closing 68 that day was good for a share of eighth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rory McIlroy, the Canadian Open champion after shooting a 61 on the final day, was happy for his countryman’s accomplishment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It would’ve been such a shame if the Open comes to Portrush and the hometown boy couldn’t play,” McIlroy said. “I know it’s something he’s wanted for a while. Obviously, it’ll be great to have him in the field at Portrush.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[Read more on how the </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/sports/golf/british-open-royal-portrush.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">British Open finally returned to Royal Portrush</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> after almost 70 years.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For nearly a decade, McIlroy, McDowell and Darren Clarke had been pushing to bring the Open back to their homeland. Royal Portrush had been host for the 1951 edition, but the tournament had not returned.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Their efforts were rewarded four years ago when it was announced that the 2019 Open would be played at Royal Portrush. But as the date approached, McDowell still had not qualified.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Clarke and McIlroy have guaranteed berths until age 60 as past Open champions; Clarke won in 2011 and McIlroy in 2014. And for years, McDowell’s world ranking was good enough to earn an automatic place in the lineup.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McDowell reached as high as sixth at the end of 2010, when he won the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach and had three other victories.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He won five more times through 2014, nearly adding a second U.S. Open crown in 2012 and tying for fifth at the British Open a month later. He stayed entrenched among the top 25 into 2015. Even then, he won the OHL Classic in Mexico late that year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Changes off the course were beginning to have an impact. McDowell built a home in Florida and married Kristin Stape in 2013. Children followed, and he entered the restaurant business.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He fell out of the top 100 in 2017 and finished last year at 238.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Golf is a fickle game,” McDowell said. “I took my eye off the ball — it felt like for a second — and a hundred 25-year-old kids came running by me.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Starting this season, McDowell’s PGA Tour status was even in question. After finishing outside the top 150 in last year’s FedExCup standings, his entry status fell.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’ve had to ask myself some pretty hard questions the last couple of years,” McDowell said. “Thankfully, I’ve come to the conclusion that if it was all gone, I would miss it. So you know what, let’s try to enjoy it while it’s here. It’s an opportunity.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Opportunity came at the Corales Puntacana Resort &amp; Club Championship, a secondary event for those not eligible for a World Golf Championships stop the same week. Back-to-back 64s gave McDowell the lead heading to the final day, and he won by a shot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The victory restored McDowell to a full PGA Tour card, and he could then focus on getting to Royal Portrush.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I felt the story snowballing,” McDowell said. “I felt like every tournament that I went to, people were reminding me that I wasn’t in Portrush. ‘Hope to see you at Portrush,’ ‘Hope you get in.’ Yeah, I know. I hope I do, too.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Canadian Open is part of the Open Qualifying Series, tournaments in which British Open berths are made available to top finishers not already qualified. Failing that, McDowell was headed to the qualifier at St. Annes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If that didn’t work, three more berths were dangling at the Scottish Open.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I certainly didn’t want to be in Scotland, last chance saloon, going, ‘This is it,’” he said. “But that was a real possibility.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rounds of 65 and 67 put McDowell in contention in Canada, though a third-round 70 slowed his momentum. Beginning the final day, four golfers ahead of McDowell or tied with him were also competing for the three slots for Royal Portrush.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Things were still not settled as he headed to the final hole, where he drove in the left rough and had to lay up. His third shot stopped just short of the fringe.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The putt was not makable, no,” McDowell recalled. “It had 12 feet of break in it. It was a ridiculously tough putt to make. I just fancied it — saw it, liked the way it looked.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“And when I saw it go in, it was a huge relief.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McDowell tied for 16th at the U.S. Open and then headed for Royal Portrush. Though he faces a battle against such rivals as McIlroy and the world No. 1 Brooks Koepka, he feels the confidence returning.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“To have the Open ticket punched now,” he said, “gives me that little bit of breathing room to hopefully focus on my game and be competitive. I feel like I’m playing well.”</p>',\n",

In this series, The Times is going back to the scene of major news events to see if those promises were kept.</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">LONDON<!-- --> — When fire broke out at Grenfell Tower in London, the flames were whisked through the 24-story structure with astonishing speed, killing 72 people in Britain’s deadliest housing fire since World War II.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Outrage spread quickly when Britons learned the cheap cladding that shrouded the tower had turned it into a death trap. Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to an enraged nation that “no stone will be left unturned” to make sure the disaster never repeated itself. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nearly two years after the Grenfell fire in June 2017, this is what we found of the government’s efforts, which have left tens of thousands of people at risk:</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">About 16,000 private apartments are still wrapped in the kind of exterior cladding that fed the Grenfell fire.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Their owners feel trapped in tinderboxes they cannot sell, and some residents have <!-- -->felt compelled<!-- --> to join round-the-clock patrols of their buildings, always on guard for a spark or whiff of smoke.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">The government did move fairly quickly to strip the dangerous cladding from public housing towers, but people in approximately 8,400 public apartments await a full repair.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Many of the business-friendly regulations that allowed Grenfell to be built on the cheap remain in place, despite a promise to rethink them top to bottom.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">The government has been slow to look at other types of flammable coverings that may be putting at least 340 additional apartment towers in <!-- -->danger<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">The Problem</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A year before the fire, contractors re-clad Grenfell Tower with a form of low-cost aluminum paneling<!-- -->. The cladding was banned in the United States and many European countries because if a fire breaks out, it allows the flames to spread quickly.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But English building rules were more lenient. As long as the cladding’s surface — the aluminum — was nonflammable, it mattered less what was inside.

The public housing block was soon incinerated, and its scorched shell still looms over London.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To many, the disaster was an indictment of a decades-long anti-regulatory crusade in Britain.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Led by Margaret Thatcher, successive British governments diluted hundreds of pages of detailed building rules into much vaguer benchmarks; let private companies take over inspection work; and then, in the mid-2000s, opened the door to flammable cladding with small changes to the guidelines, experts said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Grenfell fire was viewed as a watershed. Top officials promised major changes. The commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, Dany Cotton, called it a “turning point” in the country’s approach to building safety.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Inspectors began searching for high-rise apartment buildings with Grenfell-style cladding. They found 433 and ordered it removed.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But by April of this year, fewer than 100 of the buildings ordered fixed had been taken care of, with 338 of them still bearing flammable aluminum cladding. Living in them has meant daily torment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you think about it all the time, you just go mental,” said Rachel Guy, whose 10-story, privately owned South London apartment building is partly wrapped in the same combustible sandwich of aluminum and plastic used at Grenfell. “You’re living in a building that’s fundamentally unsafe.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A firefighter told Ms. Guy a fire could send flames from the bottom to top of the building within seven minutes. She worried that her mother, 81, would never make it downstairs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The government did soon direct 400 million pounds, or $523 million, to help the local authorities remove the cladding from approximately 150 public housing blocks. That work is happening, if at a pace slower than some might have wanted: A third of the buildings have been fixed, half are mid-repair, and almost all the rest have retrofitting plans in place.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But nobody wanted to pay to remove the cladding from privately owned high-rises.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In England, most private apartments are sold as long-term leases, with the building itself owned by a “freeholder,” often an investment group. The law made it difficult for either residents or the government to hold these building owners liable for the cladding.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In fact, the owners of private buildings like Ms. Guy’s were pressing residents to pay to replace it. The bill at her building came to 70,000 pounds, or $89,000, per flat: an impossible amount for many.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While residents resisted paying for the repairs, there were other costs they couldn’t avoid. Among them were round-the-clock patrols, mandated by local fire brigades, that are supposed to protect people from their building’s flammable skin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Guy, a retired English teacher, paces the hallways of her building three times a week while her neighbors sleep, peering into garbage chutes and sniffing for smoke. Even with residents like Ms. Guy taking on shifts for subminimum wages, the patrols cost residents about 200,000 pounds a year.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For the most part, it is not luxury apartment towers, but buildings filled with first-time buyers, retirees, working-class people and immigrants that have shouldered the burden of combustible cladding.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I haven\\'t seen 20,000 pounds since I scrimped and saved to purchase my property,” said William Martin, a medical student in Sheffield who was told each apartment had to pay that sum to fix his building’s <!-- --> cladding. “My building is still wrapped in what is the most dangerous material known to man, considering what happened at Grenfell.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Unable to sell or remortgage his property, he added: “I’m basically stuck in this nightmare.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The financial and psychological stress is taking a heavy toll. A survey carried out by a coalition of affected tenants found scores of people saying they felt daily anxiety. Home, once a refuge, started to feel like a cage.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After failing to persuade building owners to pay for the cladding repairs themselves, the government this month allocated about $254 million for the work.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new fund was a relief, but hardly a cure-all.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Residents are still on the hook for stopgap safety measures, like new alarms and building patrols. Because the repairs are complicated and specialists are in short supply, waits for fixes could be long, possibly stretching for years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And the Grenfell-style cladding covered by the government fund is hardly the only fire propellant lining the sides of English high-rises.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Guy’s high-rise is covered in a tapestry of flammable cladding, not just the Grenfell type.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Among them is a particularly dangerous, widespread variety called high-pressure laminate, or HPL. It emits more smoke and ignites even faster than aluminum cladding. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Nobody took any notice of it,” said Richard Hull, a fire science professor at the University of Central Lancashire. “The next Grenfell tragedy is more likely to be on an HPL-clad building because there’s a hell of a lot more of them, and no action’s been taken to do anything about it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">HPL is banned from new buildings, but the government has left it on existing ones.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And HPL is not the only other cladding causing worry. An insulation maker, Rockwool, has estimated 340 recently built high-rise complexes use flammable cladding different from the kind on Grenfell. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The government says tests on different kinds of dangerous cladding like HPL began last month, though experts have raised concerns about the tests’ reliability.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Katie Peate lives in a building in Manchester covered in timber cladding and an insulation system that residents were told was more combustible than Grenfell’s. Her building owner wants residents to pay for repairs, at a cost of up to 80,000 pounds per flat. The government fund covers none of it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Beyond apartment towers, more than 1,300 vulnerable buildings like hospitals, care homes, schools and hotels have flammable exteriors, Rockwool estimates, but are exempt from having to strip it because they are not high-rises.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The big worry now is the government is going to think this is job done,” Ms. Peate said. “They didn’t realize they were going to open this can of worms.”</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Grenfell exposed a broken system of building safety, where lax construction regulation let developers “race to the bottom,” according to a government-ordered review conducted after the disaster.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Prime Minister May held up the government’s response to Grenfell in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/world/europe/may-speech.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">her resignation speech</a> last week as one of the biggest achievements of her tenure.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But many others saw it differently, with a firefighters’ union calling it “disgraceful” that Mrs. May celebrated efforts that have left lax building rules untouched and tens of thousands of people in danger. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/707785/Building_a_Safer_Future_-_web.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">The recommendations of the regulatory review</a>, presented to Parliament a year ago, disappointed many safety experts who had seen it as a golden opportunity for an overhaul<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It did not recommend that fire sprinklers be installed on existing high-rises or on new buildings below 10 stories. It did not ask for a new mandate on second staircases for escaping blazes, which remain optional in many cases, too. And the government’s ban on Grenfell-style cladding applies only to buildings above 18 meters, or about six stories.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For many fire safety experts, those were head-spinning decisions, signaling an inability — or unwillingness — to reshape the regulatory landscape to prioritize safety over cost.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The government’s primary objective has always been to avoid the blame for Grenfell,” said Jonathan Evans, the chief executive of Ash and Lacy, a cladding systems maker. Writing strict new rules, he said, would have been an admission the old ones had allowed Grenfell-style cladding to proliferate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The government said it was still considering tougher rules about fire sprinklers and evacuation staircases, and that it had focused on buildings above six stories because firefighting becomes riskier at those heights.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There is nothing more important than making sure people are safe in their homes, and that’s why the government is committed to improving building safety,” a Housing Ministry spokesman said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Other measures recommended in the report, like harsher penalties and a new regulatory body with greater oversight powers, have won plaudits, but require parliamentary action that has yet to happen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Safety experts said they were especially concerned about how little has been done since Grenfell to protect the disabled and elderly, who cannot easily escape burning buildings. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s only a matter of time before we’ll get a vulnerable group that will die in large numbers,” said Jonathan O’Neill, the managing director of the Fire Protection Association, Britain’s national fire safety organization. “I’m absolutely convinced about it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">The Takeaway</strong>: Someone always pays for building on the cheap.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">Additional sources not cited in the article: Susan Bright, professor of land law at Oxford University; Stuart Hodkinson, associate professor in critical urban geography at University of Leeds; Alistair Murray, director and leader of fire engineering team at Arup; Giles Peaker, housing lawyer and partner at Anthony Gold Solicitors; Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London; Ritu Saha, co-founder of U.K. Cladding Action Group; Arnold Tarling, chartered surveyor at BETA - Chartered Surveyors Ltd.</p>',\n",

       " 'hiv-testing-treatment-africa': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Imagine that 90 percent of all people living with H.I.V. were diagnosed and treated with drugs. Would that be sufficient to end the AIDS epidemic?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Scientists tried to answer the question i<!-- -->n three enormous studies published on Wednesday<!-- --> in the New England Journal of Medicine. <!-- -->Instead of simply urging people to get testing and treatment for H.I.V., health workers in five African countries went door to door, or set up mobile sites, offering tests for H.I.V., tuberculosis and other diseases to everyone in certain communities<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Anyone who tested positive for the infection was set up with clinic appointment to receive antiretroviral drugs. Then investigators assessed whether these efforts made any difference in the number of new H.I.V. infections in those communities.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Results from three of the studies suggest that the strategy comes nowhere near bringing the rate of new infections with H.I.V., or incidence, down to zero. But all of the studies showed that incidence dropped by about 30 percent, and one found a decrease in H.I.V.-related deaths.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Some of us were hoping for a higher reduction in incidence,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, who heads the scientific advisory board at the <!-- -->President’s<!-- --> Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, which helped fund the studies. “But at the same time, it’s not trivial. A 30 percent reduction in incidence is pretty dramatic.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Worldwide, there were roughly 38 million people living with H.I.V. in 2018. <!-- -->The epidemic continues to ravage Africa: About 26 million people on the continent have H.I.V., of whom just 16.5 million receive drug therapy. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the new studies, called <!-- -->Ya T’sie<!-- --> (a reference to teamwork in the Setswana language), <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812281\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">focused on 15 pairs of villages in Botswana</a>, while a second, called Search, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1809866\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">examined 32 rural communities in Kenya and Uganda</a>. The largest of the three studies, PopART, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1814556\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">looked at 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Together, the studies cost more than $200 million and included nearly 1.5 million people. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The scale and scope of these studies is remarkable,” said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, an H.I.V. expert at Columbia University in New York and leader of a group that helped fund <!-- -->PopART<!-- -->. “This is public health research at its best.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a bid to slow the epidemic, the United Nations set <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/909090\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">“90-90-90” targets for the year 2020</a>: diagnose 90 percent of people infected with H.I.V.; treat 90 percent of those diagnosed with antiretroviral therapy, regardless of disease stage; and keep the virus suppressed in 90 percent of those who are treated.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If this strategy were carried out successfully, it would leave nearly three-quarters of infected individuals with such low levels of H.I.V. in their blood that they would be unable to infect anyone else. The new studies were the first to try the so-called universal test-and-treat approach, and all of them surpassed the 90-90-90 targets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Each study was designed differently, but broadly speaking, the teams randomized entire communities to receive either the standard of care for that country, or some combination of <!-- -->treatments, including testing for H.I.V., TB and sexually transmitted infections; counseling; condoms; prenatal care; and voluntary medical circumcision.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Each study arrived at roughly the same 30 percent figure for the drop in incidence. Given the studies’ size and complexity, however, the details are not straightforward.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A key finding from all three studies was the importance of a “warm handoff”: Community health workers made sure that everyone who tested positive for H.I.V. showed up at a clinic for treatment. They called or texted people to remind them of their appointments, and escorted them to clinics if necessary.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Some people for so many reasons don’t show up,” said Dr. Shahin Lockman of Harvard University, who led Ya T’sie. “They’re scared, they’re not ready, they’re worried, they’re busy.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A lack of follow-up may explain why another trial, called TasP, found no effect on H.I.V. incidence. That study, funded by the French government and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29199100\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">published last year</a> in The Lancet, was conducted in KwaZulu Natal in South Africa and did not meet the treatment targets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Linkage to care was the critical weakness in TasP,” said Dr. Gilles Van Cutsem, an adviser to the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, who was not involved in the newer studies. “That is the most difficult part to achieve.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Given the scale of the three new studies, the researchers expected their analyses to be complex. But the teams also faced unexpected snags.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2013, when the trials began, the standard of care in those countries was to offer antiretroviral drugs only to H.I.V.-infected people with a CD4 count — a measure of certain immune cells in the blood — of 350 or less. (The range for a healthy person is 500 to 1,500.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By 2016, however, the countries all began offering universal treatment — that is, antiretroviral drugs to anyone who is H.I.V. positive, regardless of CD4 count — although not universal testing. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The change was good for patients, of course, but made it difficult, and perhaps even unnecessary, to assess the benefits of universal treatment. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The switch had the biggest impact on PopART, which split its 21 communities into three groups: one received universal testing and treatment, while the second got universal testing but treatment according to local guidelines. The third group held to local guidelines for both testing and treatment. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Once the countries switched to universal treatment, however, the first two groups “were essentially identical,”<!-- --> said Dr. Richard Hayes, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, who was a co-leader of PopART. “When we originally designed this study, we never expected that to be such a rapid change.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Despite both groups being identical, only the second showed a 30 percent drop in H.I.V. incidence <!-- -->— a result that has so far stumped the researchers. (The first group showed a 7 percent decrease, but that was not a statistically significant result.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Oh my God, talk about a weird finding,” said Dr. del Rio. “I don’t know. I don’t know what to make of it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While they attempt to solve the mystery, Dr. Hayes and his colleagues have opted to combine the results from both the first and second groups and reported a cumulative drop in incidence of 20 percent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Search study also had its share of problems. That team’s approach included tests even for chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, and the investigators saw a 32 percent decrease in H.I.V. infections.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the comparison group also showed a similar drop — perhaps because the researchers also offered the full testing package even to people in that group, said Dr. Diane Havlir of the University of California, San Francisco, who led the study.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, the team saw a 23 percent decrease in deaths from H.I.V., and 59 percent decrease in TB infections among people with H.I.V. Testing for a range of diseases is helpful and realistic, Dr. Havlir said, because it reduces stigma and makes it easy to enroll patients in care for many conditions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you’re not just doing it for H.I.V. and you’re committed to building care for these other diseases, it’s a shared cost,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In all of the new studies, health workers had the most trouble reaching men and young people for H.I.V. testing. Some of the teams tried setting up tents and camps near farms, taxi ranks, schools and sports events, and operated them even on weekends and evenings. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Men go from having a pediatrician to having a geriatrician, that’s been a consistent finding in global health,” said Dr. Del Rio. “It also shows where we need to put a lot of our efforts.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But those efforts are unlikely to be <!-- -->carried out on <!-- -->anywhere near the scale of these new studies, partly because of the expense, and because universal treatment has already become the standard.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These are all really important studies, but never again will they be performed,” Dr. Del Rio said. “Because the world has changed, we will not see this again.” </p>',\n",

Would the Chinese government hold to its promise to maintain “one country, two systems” for the next 50 years? Would it let Hong Kong remain Hong Kong?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Beijing was quick to offer reassurances.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> “China,” its premier told his British counterpart, “would prove her words by her deeds,” according a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/HKDF/841219-0945-mt-zhao-memcon-43108196\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">declassified British government memo</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But as Hong Kong marks the 22nd anniversary of the handover on Monday, some of China’s recent deeds suggest something else.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hong Kongers may still enjoy a degree of freedom mainland Chinese can only envy, with freedom of assembly, a free press and an unfettered judicial system. But almost every day brings new evidence those freedoms are slipping away, with the territory falling farther under Beijing’s shadow. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In recent weeks, Hong Kongers have <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-live-updates.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">taken to the streets to protest</a>. For many here, there is a sense of time running out.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There will be a moment that mainland China will completely take over Hong Kong,” said Danny Chan, a 25-year-old primary school teaching assistant who joined a recent protest. “As a Hong Kong citizen, the best we can do is postpone it.”</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">HOW WE GOT HERE</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The British arrived in China in the late 17th century, bent on trade and empire, and soon found themselves at odds with Chinese rulers happy to export their goods, but far less interested in importing the West’s. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In opium, Britain saw a way in, forcing the drug onto the Chinese market against the wishes of the Manchu emperors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The British claimed Hong Kong from the Chinese through two wars, later securing part of the territory with a 99-year lease that expired on July 1, 1997.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During the Hong Kong handover talks in the 1980s, China rejected Britain’s desire to continue running the territory, and instead proposed that Hong Kong become a semi-autonomous region of China. China’s then-premier, Zhao Ziyang, told Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain that there should be no doubts about Beijing’s trustworthiness.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And at first, when <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0630.html?module=inline#article\" title=\"\">Beijing took over in 1997</a>, it did take a light touch. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the fears of many in Hong Kong that their rights would disappear overnight in 1997 proved exaggerated, since then there has been a gradually escalating assault on liberty.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Unlike in 1997, I think some of the unease today comes from certainty, not uncertainty,” said Peter T.Y. Cheung, an associate professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">China’s controlling approach toward the territory has grown increasingly clear since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 and set out to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/world/asia/china-xi-jinping.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">strengthen his grip</a> across the country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In particular over the past six, seven or eight years, we have seen Beijing tightening its grip over Hong Kong,” said Anson Chan, the No. 2 official in Hong Kong government before the handover and for four years after.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During Britain’s rule of Hong Kong, the colonial governor was appointed, and directly elected seats on the legislature were only introduced in the early 1990s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Basic Law</a>, which amounts to a constitution for Hong Kong and took effect in 1997, <!-- -->declares that the <!-- -->“ultimate aim” is for the chief executive and the entire legislature to be chosen by <!-- -->voters<!-- -->. In 2007, when China was led by <!-- -->Hu Jintao<!-- -->, it set a date for the vote, saying the chief executive could be directly elected in 2017, followed by the whole legislature.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That did not happen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2017, Hong Kong’s chief executive was once again chosen by a committee that has always done Beijing’s bidding. And nearly half the legislature is made up of representatives chosen by professional sectors, <!-- -->not the voters at large<!-- -->. There is no sign that will change when the legislature is up for election again next year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The most significant area of erosion is the promise that 20 years after 1997, Hong Kong should be able to choose its own chief executive through a direct election,” said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. “That promise has clearly not been kept.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Carrie Lam, who became chief executive in 2017, often says that she has two bosses, Beijing and Hong Kong. But Beijing’s role in choosing the chief executive leads to widespread questions over who calls the shots in Hong Kong.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Beijing did once endorse a form of direct elections for Hong Kong, but with a big catch: Hong Kongers could vote for their leader, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/world/asia/hong-kong-elections.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the Chinese legislature decided</a> in 2014, but the candidates must first be approved by a pro-Beijing nominating committee. In other words, Hong Kong could elect its own leader, but only from a handful of candidates acceptable to the Communist Party.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Thus was the so-called Umbrella Movement born. Those restrictions set off <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/world/asia/clashes-in-hong-kong.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">huge protests in Hong Kong</a>, and demonstrators occupied city streets for nearly three months to protest what they labeled “fake democracy.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A year later, the Hong Kong legislature <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/world/asia/hong-kong-votes-down-beijing-election-plan.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">rejected the plan</a>, with pro-democracy lawmakers voting unanimously against it. Some suggested that the democratic camp may have missed a chance at an incremental gain that could have later been improved upon.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Britain and China hashed out <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/20/world/hong-kong-accord-is-signed-in-peking.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a treaty</a> in the 1980s on what a post-handover world would look like, negotiators were at pains to establish where China’s authority ended and Hong Kong\\'s began.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Foreign affairs? China. National Defense? The same. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, all other responsibilities were to reside with Hong Kong.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In recent years, though, there have been clear signs those lines are blurring, especially when it comes to the realm of justice.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So when Hong Kongers, who were already afraid their autonomy was deteriorating, got word about a new extradition measure coming before the Hong Kong legislature that would ease sending people to mainland China for trial, the result was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/20/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-size.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">huge street protests</a> unlike any since the Umbrella Movement — and a delay of the plan by the authorities.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the extradition measure would make it legally easier for mainland China to seize Hong Kongers, the absence of such a law appears not to have stopped mainland authorities in the past. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2015, five people connected with Causeway Bay Books, a Hong Kong establishment that sold gossipy books about mainland Chinese politics, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/business/international/in-china-books-that-make-money-and-enemies.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">disappeared</a>. One was apparently grabbed off the streets of Hong Kong, another kidnapped from his home in Thailand. Three more were detained in mainland China, <!-- -->where all five were held<!-- --> and one remains in custody.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As lawless as these covert actions may seem, they may be, paradoxically, less of a threat to Hong Kong’s autonomy than overt coercion, since they involve going around the backs of the local courts rather than insisting that judges bend their standards.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many in Hong Kong fear that the proposed extradition law would allow mainland authorities to directly demand the handover of people wanted in political cases, despite promised human rights safeguards.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After the law was proposed, Lam Wing-kee, one of the previously detained booksellers, fled to Taiwan.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“From the book store incident, you can see that the Chinese government wants to control free speech in Hong Kong,” he said. “Now it’s gotten worse. With the extradition law they want to make such kidnappings legal, and bring Chinese law to Hong Kong.”</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Joint Declaration signed in 1984 declares that a free press will be ensured by law. But many media organizations say they are struggling as mainland China undermines that right.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There are many ways such pressure is applied.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Executives at the most vocally pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, say the Chinese government’s liaison office has told large companies to pull advertising.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And last year, Hong Kong <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/world/asia/hong-kong-journalist-financial-times.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">expelled a Financial Times editor</a> who had hosted a talk by an activist who called for the city’s secession from China. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The decision to expel a representative of a powerful Western publication sent a chill through many in the city. Some journalists began saying that the long-predicted “death of Hong Kong” had finally arrived.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The independent book publishing industry has also taken a big hit. The Causeway Bay Books detentions shocked many in the industry, leading some businesses to close. The few that remain say they have <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/books/hong-kong-publishing-tiananmen.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">run into severe difficulties</a> printing and selling books on politics and history in Hong Kong, which they attribute to pressure from the mainland.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sino United Publishing, a Chinese government-owned company, now controls almost all of the book publishing and retail sales market in Hong Kong. Books banned on the mainland are not found on the shelves of its outlets.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hong Kong’s judiciary is one of the most deeply respected of local institutions, prized for its independence. Its judges, often educated in England, are in the habit of issuing decisions that protect civil liberties.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Beijing promised to protect all that. Instead, it is whittling away at it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">China’s central government made its views on Hong Kong courts clear in a 2014 white paper that called judges “administrators” who must be patriots and for whom “loving the country” is a basic political requirement. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Hong Kong people are used to separation of powers,” said Martin Lee, a founder of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party who served on the Basic Law drafting committee. “This was alarming.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While most observers say Hong Kong’s courts remain independent, the fundamental weakness is that Beijing acts as a Supreme Court, deciding how the territory’s laws should be interpreted. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2016, Beijing used that power against pro-democracy lawmakers who staged protests during their oaths of office. After the Chinese legislature ruled that oaths must be taken “sincerely and solemnly,” what happened to the lawmakers? They <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/world/asia/hong-kong-lawmakers-democracy.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">were ousted</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">The Takeaway:</strong> On paper, Hong Kong’s autonomy is guaranteed for another 28 years. On the ground, the reality appears far less certain.</p>',\n",

       " 'house-impeachment-trump': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">WASHINGTON — The House on Wednesday killed an attempt to impeach President Trump for statements that the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/trump-tweet-house-vote.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">chamber condemned this week as racist</a>, turning aside an accusation that he had brought “ridicule, disgrace and disrepute” to his office.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The move split Democrats, underscoring the divisions within the party over whether they should use their majority to charge Mr. Trump and try to remove him from office, with 95 signaling their support for at least considering the question further, and 137 moving to stop the current effort in its tracks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The president brushed off the vote as a victory, and hours later, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/trump-rally-greenville-nc.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">at a rally in Greenville, N.C.</a>, he showed no signs of easing his attacks or toning down the vicious language that led to the impeachment attempt. He charged that the “dangerous, militant hard left” among the Democrats were “hate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the end of the rally, Mr. Trump went even further, accusing them of seeking the “destruction of our country.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They don’t love our country,” he told the roaring crowd. “I think, in some cases, they hate our country. You know what? If they don’t love it, tell them to leave it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump specifically went after the four freshman congresswomen — all women of color — whom he urged this week “to go back” to their country of origin. Of the four, only Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a refugee from Somalia, was born overseas. At the mention of her name, the crowd chanted: “Send her back! Send her back!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The 332-to-95 vote to table the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/116/crec/2019/07/16/modified/CREC-2019-07-16-pt1-PgH5857.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">impeachment article drafted by Representative Al Green</a>, Democrat of Texas, constituted the first action by the House since Democrats took control in January on a measure to impeach Mr. Trump, a significant move that Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and other party leaders have toiled to avoid. By agreeing to table the article, Ms. Pelosi and the Democrats put off — at least for now — a prolonged and divisive debate over whether Mr. Trump’s conduct warrants his expulsion.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But it was hardly the last word on the topic from Democrats torn about how to deal with the president, between progressives who want to challenge him more aggressively and moderates desperate to quash talk of impeachment and stick to a poll-tested agenda that includes improving health coverage and raising wages for working people.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Pelosi has been caught in the middle as she tries to maintain some semblance of control over the party’s agenda while Mr. Trump increasingly dictates the terms of the debate. Those dynamics have already dominated the House’s business this week. For two days, Democrats feuded with the president over his posts on Twitter about four freshman Democratic congresswomen of color.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You have to give him credit: He’s a great distractor,” Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California, said of Mr. Trump on Wednesday. She waved off questions about whether the Democrats’ policy priorities were being eclipsed by the president, saying, “We’re not having him set our agenda; we’re setting our own agenda.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But in recent days, thanks to Mr. Trump’s penchant for stirring up the hottest of political controversies and simmering divisions within their own ranks, House Democrats have not seemed to be able to get out of their own way. This week has been a case in point.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump’s tweets prompted a rush by Democratic leaders to press a resolution condemning him. The vote on the measure took place on Tuesday, and the floor debate devolved into an extraordinarily polarizing spectacle as Republicans and Democrats argued about whether it was appropriate for Ms. Pelosi to have branded the president’s tweets “racist.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then Mr. Green’s decision to force action on his impeachment resolution stretched the narrative into Wednesday, overshadowing marquee Democratic issues, including a vote this week to raise the minimum wage to $15 and one to repeal a tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health plans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s time for us to deal with his bigotry,” Mr. Green said on Wednesday. “This president has demonstrated that he’s willing to yell ‘fire’ in a crowded theater, and we have seen what can happen to people when bigotry is allowed to have a free rein. We all ought to go on record. We all ought to let the world know where we stand when we have a bigot in the White House.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A separate vote on Wednesday evening to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/barr-ross-contempt-vote.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">hold in contempt</a> William P. Barr, the attorney general, and Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, for their refusal to comply with an investigation into the addition of a citizenship question to the census — a move the administration has since abandoned — added to the portrait of a House floor dominated by Mr. Trump and what Democrats consider his misdeeds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I wonder, when I watch people campaign and they talk about what they want to achieve here, how many said they wanted to have a week of contempt, of impeach and resolution all after one entity, the president of the United States?” said Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader. “I didn’t have anybody on either side of the aisle ever ask me that question.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Privately, House Democratic leaders coached lawmakers to stay focused on policy achievements that they could tout when they return home for a six-week summer recess beginning in 10 days. In a closed-door meeting in the basement of the Capitol, the chiefs of the party’s messaging arm urged lawmakers to use events in their home districts during the recess to spotlight the legislation they have passed to address health care costs, wages and corruption.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But just outside the room, reporters swarmed Mr. Green, pressing him for details about his impeachment resolution.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At one point, Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, one of the party’s messaging leaders, popped out of the meeting, stopped before a bank of television cameras and pleaded to talk about anything but impeachment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You know what I think? I wish that all of you would ask me about prescription drugs,” Mrs. Dingell said, before ultimately giving up.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, conceded on Wednesday that the party was having a hard time focusing voters’ attention on the minimum wage or any other policy they were pushing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The American people need to be informed about what it is their legislators are doing,” Mr. Clyburn lamented during an interview on CNN, “and not be so preoccupied with a lawless president who seems not to care much about the law.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The trouble is, House Democrats have been unable to shift the spotlight at crucial moments, particularly given the pent-up desire among some of their members to meet Mr. Trump’s over-the-top behavior with dramatic ripostes of their own. That was the case with his tweets against the four congresswomen, which prompted some Democrats to call for his censure or impeachment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Knowing how problematic such a vote would be for centrist lawmakers in Republican-leaning districts, Ms. Pelosi opted for a mere condemnation of the president’s rhetoric, which she said on Wednesday had been deliberately meant to be as “benign” as possible.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Part of the feral genius of Trump is that even when he has not fully thought it through, by behaving outrageously, he demands a response,” said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who was a senior White House adviser to President Barack Obama. “Pelosi tried to thread a needle by choosing the least disruptive response that would give the broadest number of people the opportunity to express themselves.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Axelrod said the difficulty for Democrats is in striking the right balance between trumpeting their achievements while presenting a vivid alternative to Mr. Trump’s penchant for norm-shattering behavior.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You need a little jujitsu to turn that against him and make people focus on the sheer opportunism of it and the bankruptcy of it — and the cost to the country of just being locked in it day after day,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Green’s resolution on impeachment made no mention of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-russian-interference-donald-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Robert S. Mueller III’s report</a> or other instances of possible abuses of power by the president that are being studied by the House Judiciary Committee as possible grounds for impeachment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Instead, it contained a single article that referred to the vote on Tuesday to condemn Mr. Trump’s tweets as racist, and concluded: “Donald John Trump has, by his statements, brought the high office of the president of the United States in contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute, has sown seeds of discord among the people of the United States, has demonstrated that he is unfit to be president, and has betrayed his trust as president of the United States to the manifest injury of the people of the United States, and has committed a high misdemeanor in office.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Pelosi said that she had no quarrel with Mr. Green, but that the House was already taking sufficient steps to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his conduct.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have six committees that are working on following the facts in terms of any abuse of power, obstruction of justice and the rest that the president may have engaged in,” she said. “That is the serious path that we are on.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. McCarthy, who moved to kill the resolution on impeachment, later told a reporter he had done so “because I think it’s stupid.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wednesday’s vote did not necessarily reflect the depth of enthusiasm or opposition for impeachment among Democrats. Some who voted to kill the measure said they had done so not because they were against impeachment, while others who voted to keep it alive said they did not favor impeaching Mr. Trump. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said he had voted to kill the measure because it should have been referred to his panel, which has jurisdiction over the matter.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I very much doubt that today will be the last action we must consider to hold President Trump accountable,” he said in a statement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One Democrat, Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, voted “present.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Speaking with reporters on Wednesday morning, Mr. Green acknowledged differences with Democratic leaders, but framed his decision to force the impeachment vote as strictly a matter of conscience.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Green, who <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/impeachment-trump-green-sherman.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">first drafted articles of impeachment</a> after Mr. Trump’s comments about the clash between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville, Va., has twice before forced similar votes. But in both cases, Republicans controlled the chamber and voted overwhelmingly to table his resolutions.</p>',\n",

       " 'immigration-trump': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">President Trump’s approach to migration, which has reshaped American border enforcement with its “zero tolerance” policy, follows a model pioneered by the European Union and Australia — though they may not have pursued it with Mr. Trump’s bombast.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Like Mr. Trump’s policies, defined by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/border-center-migrant-detention.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">child-filled detention camps</a> and his extraordinary move to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/trump-asylum-rule.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">ban nearly all asylum claims</a> at the southern border, this model relies on two strategies to keep migrants and refugees from reaching the border at all:</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">1) Make the journey so daunting that they will not even attempt it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">2) Enlist poorer countries to detain or expel those who do anyway.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That approach, which Europe and Australia have taken to extremes beyond many of Mr. Trump’s policies, was meant to curb record migrant arrivals and the white backlash to them that was upending Western politics. Those arrivals have since declined, and populist revolts cooled.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the lessons of Europe and Australia’s experience may not be so straightforward.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Strategies to deter or block migrants, research has found, may temporarily reduce arrivals. Over the long term, however, they may simply push migrants to try even more dangerous routes. They may also end up requiring governments to take ever more extreme measures to shut down each new round of arrivals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The costs are becoming higher and higher and higher, and there’s no real proof that it works,” said Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen, a Danish scholar who is co-author of an <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/233150241700500103\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">authoritative study</a> on deterrence in immigration.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those costs include concessions to countries tasked with keeping migrants away — Turkey, Sudan and Libya for Europe; a network of island nations for Australia. Mr. Trump is now pushing Mexico and Guatemala to do the same.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They extend beyond money. Europe is subjugating an ever-growing share of its foreign policy and trade agendas to the appeasement of Turkey and Libya’s authoritarian leaders. Australia’s immigration policies increasingly deter even high-skilled workers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Gammeltoft-Hansen said he had seen the same pattern play out in Europe for years: The bloc escalates harsh policies to deter migrants. It works for a while. Refugees find new tactics. And then the cycle would repeat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Very few states can say that the strategies they’re pursuing are overall effective,” he said, and for one simple reason: “Because you haven’t fixed the underlying problem.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The European Union has not so much ended the migrant crisis as relocated it. It has diverted hundreds of thousands of people to poorer countries that have proven neither able nor willing to bear that burden indefinitely — creating the conditions for more crises.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Europe dressed up its policies in the language of regional stability and human rights, as has Australia. Now that Mr. Trump is using overt hostility to immigration and appeals to racial resentment to explain the same approach, it may make the costs and trade-offs of those policies more difficult to ignore.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The immigration strategy increasingly common across Western governments — and the reasons many experts consider it far less effective than it appears on the surface — can be seen in the story of two migrant boats that departed Libya’s coast for Europe earlier this year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The first boat capsized early in its journey across the Mediterranean, killing all but three of the 120 passengers. Under the central premise of European immigration policy, that should have deterred more migrants from attempting to cross.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">European policymakers didn’t set out to capsize boats. Their goal was to make the journey so dangerous — by curtailing search-and-rescue missions, restricting aid groups, even closing their ports to emergency rescue vessels — that migrants would be dissuaded from setting out in the first place.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And yet just one week later, another boat set out from Libya’s coast, its passengers undeterred.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This was not unusual.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/borders-and-walls-do-barriers-deter-unauthorized-migration\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">2016 study</a> found that physical barriers to migration in Europe and the United States had not prevented crossings. Instead, it said, they had produced “an increase in the number of deaths” by pushing migration into “ever more dangerous paths.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The second boat was intercepted by Libya’s coast guard, as part of a European Union deal granting its government sweeping concessions. The 144 on board, including children and pregnant women, were returned to Libya and locked in warehouses so squalid that they, too — in theory, anyway — should have scared people off from trying the sea crossing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“No amount of preparation can actually prepare you for standing inside the detention center and seeing the sea of faces huddled in a dark room,” said Sam Turner, the head of mission for Doctors Without Borders in Libya. “It’s really harrowing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Detainees told Mr. Turner that the conditions had come as no surprise, and it seems clear they were no deterrent. Fewer than 1 percent of the half-million-plus refugees and migrants in Libya are held in such centers. Among the rest, Mr. Turner has found, the warehouses are seen as a reason to try all the harder to cross.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are a bit naïve in this,” Mr. Turner said. “Policies supposed to act as deterrence factors are actually acting as push factors.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These arrangements, which come at terrible cost to migrants, allow rich countries to skirt domestic and international laws requiring them to grant certain rights to any refugees who reach their borders. And they allow rich countries to push the human costs of their policies out of sight.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the Trump administration’s detention centers have provoked major controversies in the United States, the camps created under European and Australian policies have met with far less backlash.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If Mr. Trump’s experience is anything like Europe’s, he may find that persuading Mexico or Guatemala to detain refugees on the United States’ behalf will drastically worsen conditions for refugees, but alleviate much of the backlash from Americans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Gammeltoft-Hansen, however, said he had seen many such deals come and go. They rarely survived long. Host countries lost interest as refugee camps overflowed and aid dried up, or lost the ability to uphold their end of the deal when they encountered political crises of their own.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More often, migrant flows just shifted to a new route.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was a cycle.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The European Union would scramble to cut a new deal. Each would cost European governments more than the last, to overcome skepticism from poor countries that had seen the ever-mounting risks of becoming Europe’s refugee camp. And, each time, the number of people accumulating in intermediary countries would grow.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The buildup meant that even a single dam break in the system could cause a sudden rush in arrivals. The 2015 migrant crisis, for example, was partly the result of a single short-lived break in Libya, one of Europe’s most reliable bulwarks against migrants until its government collapsed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since then, pushing the burdens of migration onto poorer countries has grown only more common.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The biggest thing that I think is changing is the ability of governments to essentially put the responsibility of refugee hosting on the less powerful,” said Stephanie Schwartz, a migration scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. “It’s become really brazen.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As policies to deter migration escalate, each new measure temporarily slows arrivals without changing the fundamental calculus made by anyone considering setting out for a new country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Turner, the Doctors Without Borders aid worker, noted that as risky as the journey may be, many refugees already face grave dangers and hardships at home that drive them to flee in the first place. Even the risk of death — a chance of one in 20 for a Mediterranean crossing, some data suggests — is not always enough to overcome the forces that drive someone to seek asylum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A quirk of European immigration misled many Westerners into believing that deterrence works, Mr. Gammeltoft-Hansen said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For years, European countries have imposed harsh measures to scare would-be migrants into settling in another European country. These did not reduce overall arrivals to Europe, Mr. Gammeltoft-Hansen said. It merely moved them around.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But it has led Western governments to chip away at the global rights and practices governing modern immigration.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump is unusual only in that he is openly and deliberately driving to upend that system. It is impossible to say for sure whether this could set off a backlash against such policies — or grant more governments license to do the same.</p>',\n",

The rocket was to launch at 2:51 a.m. Monday and the anticipation was stoking national pride.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Indian children sent good luck YouTube messages to the national space agency; V.I.P.’s were<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>converging on the launch site in a remote coastal area near Chennai; the little six-wheeled rover was crawling across the front pages of all the newspapers; and telecasters were<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>tapping the patriotism with special broadcasts on “India’s Greatest Space Adventure.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the last moment, the launch was delayed because of a technical problem.<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>A new launch date has not yet been announced.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But on Friday, at<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>the K.R. Mangalam World School near New Delhi, a place for the children of the upper middle class — there’s a roller rink on the ground floor — Veronica and her classmates were pumped.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Children,” asked Harjeet Kaur, the space class teacher, “why did we name this mission ‘Chandrayaan’?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Veronica shot up from her desk so fast she nearly knocked over the chair behind her.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Because-it-means-moon-and-vehicle,” she said in one breath.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Everybody clap for her,” the teacher said. “Is there another country that has sent a mission to the moon’s south pole?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“No!” the students shouted back.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are all proud Indians, right, students?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Really? I can’t hear you.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“YES, MA’AM!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It would be really cool to walk on the moon,” Veronica whispered a little while later. “I mean, kind of like hiking but <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">really</em> cool.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A moon mission is a bold move for any country, but especially for one that has hundreds of millions of people still stuck in poverty.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But this is the puzzle of India. It is also a hotbed of modernity, a fount of scientific and engineering prowess. Its software developers are known as some of the world’s greatest, and each year its universities pump out thousands of highly talented scientists and engineers, experts in the most cutting-edge technologies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Space suits it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A big reason Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/world/asia/india-modi-election-polls.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">won a thumping re-election in May</a>, is so popular is that he has been pushing a brawnier, more assertive India, hungry to claim its place as a superpower.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Just weeks before the election began — and commentators found the timing a little suspicious — Mr. Modi announced that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/world/asia/india-weather-satellite-missle.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">India had just shot down a satellite</a> whizzing 17,000 miles per hour 150 miles above Earth. Few countries can do that.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This isn’t even India’s first moon mission. In 2008, the lunar probe Chandrayaan I didn’t land, but discovered water molecules on the moon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The moon is definitely enjoying <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/science/nasa-moon-apollo-artemis.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a bit of a renaissance</a> on Earth. China is working on its own mission to the moon’s south pole. Scientists believe there might be <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.space.com/41554-water-ice-moon-surface-confirmed.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a lot of water ice</a> down there as well as Helium-3, a future energy source thought to be abundant on our little neighbor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many Indians feel this mission, which will unfold more than 200,000 miles away, is a turning point in their country’s history. They use almost the exact same words to describe Chandrayaan’s importance: “We will now be the fourth space power!” They follow after the United States, Russia and China.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“India would like their little space in space,” said Sunita Nagpal, the principal of the K.R. Mangalam school.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To help raise the next generation of astronauts, and go beyond the standard government science curriculum (which one private school principal snobbily dismissed as written for a rickshaw puller’s son), many private schools have looked for new ways to teach space.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Enter <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.space-india.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Space India</a>. Formed in 2001, it is a for-profit education company that runs workshops, field trips and regular classes on astronomy, rocketry and space exploration, in both public schools and fancy private ones.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many schools do not have their own space teachers and hire instructors from Space India, which even runs overnight space camp at several locations far from any cities. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This week, its lessons revolved around the moon and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/science/chandrayaan-2-india-moon.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the Chandrayaan-2 mission</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The entire mission costs less than $150 million. The orbiter will conserve fuel by making ever-widening orbits around the Earth before being captured by the moon’s gravity and pulled into lunar orbit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This takes much longer than the straight shot made by the Apollo missions, which cost billions (the fact that humans were along for the ride wasn’t cheap either). Chandrayaan’s rover won’t be rumbling across the moon’s surface until September.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s hard to overlook the synergy with <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/apollo-11-moon-landing?module=inline\" title=\"\">the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission</a> this month.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“But this is just a coincidence,” said Vivek Singh, a spokesman for the Indian Space Research Organization, India’s version of NASA. “We were late.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Indians wanted to launch two or three years ago, with a Russian rover, but when the Russians backed out they decided to build their own, which took some time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The hardest part, everyone agrees, will be the soft landing. The plan is for a landing craft to lower itself from the orbiter and gently plop itself down on the powdery moon surface. Then the little six-wheel rover (which weighs about 60 pounds) will pop out.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/science/israel-moon-lander-spaceil.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the Israelis tried to pull off a similar moon mission</a> in April, it <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/science/israel-moon-landing-beresheet.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">didn’t go so well</a>. Communications sizzled out, leaving people gathered outside the control room with tears in their eyes. The lander had crashed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To appreciate these difficulties, the students in space class at K.R. Mangalam school were asked to make lunar landers out of Styrofoam bowls, with folded paper taped to the side to act as a shock absorber. The trick was to drop the bowls from their desks and have them land without the astronaut — a pen cap — falling out.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At space class at another Delhi-area school, students built rockets out of plastic soda bottles. The style of teaching was the same, a very cheerful Socratic method, with another Space India instructor, Heena Bhatia, standing in front of the class shouting out questions and waiting for a rapid delivery of facts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You know the basic parts of the rocket? Who will tell me?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One boy stood up and blurted out the answers like verbal bullets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Nose cone. Body. Fins.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Everyone clap for Akshay,’’ the teacher beamed. “Now do you want to make your own rockets?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Yes!” the class screamed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Sir will be giving you materials to make your own rocket,” the teacher said, gesturing to a man with tattooed forearms deep in concentration in taping together little fins — he was a Space India assistant.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">All children dream of the stars. But in New Delhi, it’s often hard to see any.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That’s because the air pollution is so bad and the city lights are so bright. The result is a smudgy, opaque night sky.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“But up on the moon, it will be so beautiful,” Veronica said, her eyes glowing with that special 12-year-old light. “It will be so dark and quiet. There will be so many stars.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I don’t know why I’ve always had this interest in the moon,” she said. “But I do. I want to be close to it, not on YouTube, not on the internet. I’ve always dreamed of being an astronaut. I want to make my India proud of me.”</p>',\n",

       " 'india-water-crisis': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">CHENNAI, India — When the water’s gone, you bathe in what drips out of the air-conditioner. You no longer allow yourself the luxury of an evening shower at the end of a steamy summer’s day. You sprint down two flights of stairs with plastic pots as soon as a neighbor tells you the water tanker is coming.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Every day, 15,000 tankers ferry water from the countryside into the city. Everywhere you look, rows of bright neon plastic water pots are lined up along the lanes, waiting.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This is life in Chennai, a city of nearly five million on India’s southeastern coast. </p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">400 miles</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">CHINA</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">PAKISTAN</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">NEPAL</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">New Delhi</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">INDIA</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">Mumbai</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">Bay of Bengal</p><p class=\"g-pstyle7\">Chennai</p><p class=\"g-pstyle8\">Indian</p><p class=\"g-pstyle8\">Ocean</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">SRI LANKA</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rains from <!-- -->last year’s monsoon season were exceptionally weak<!-- -->. By the time summer came with its muggy, draining heat, the city’s four major water reservoirs had virtually run dry. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chennai has struggled with water for years. Either there’s not enough rain or there’s way too much rain, which floods in the streets before trickling out into the Bay of Bengal. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the problem is not just the caprice of nature. Gone are the many lakes and fields that once swallowed the rains. They have since been filled in and built over. Land is too expensive to be left fallow.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even groundwater is spent in many neighborhoods, over-extracted for years as a regular source of water, rather than replenished and stored as a backup. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And so now, little comes out of Bhanu Baskar’s taps at home, which is why she skips a shower on the days she doesn’t need to go out. She saves the water for her grown children, who both have office jobs and who both need a daily shower.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s very uncomfortable,” said Ms. Baskar, 48, trying to hide her shame. “It’s very tough.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s not hygienic, also,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chennai was primed for this crisis. The city gets most of its water each year from the short, heavy monsoon that begins in October and a few pre-monsoon showers. The trick is to capture what comes and save it for the lean times. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chennai requires every building to catch the rainwater from its rooftops and pour it back into the earth, but that has not been enough to stop either drought or flood. So the city spends huge amounts of money scooping water from the sea, churning it through expensive desalination plants and converting it into water that residents can use.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sekhar Raghavan, 72, a lifelong Chennai resident and the city’s most outspoken supporter of better rainwater harvesting, finds this absurd.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Some of us knew this crisis would come,” he said. “For us, in Chennai, harvesting means putting every drop of water back into the ground.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And then there’s climate change. It doesn’t bear direct blame for Chennai’s water crisis, but it makes it worse. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The city is hotter than before. Maximum temperatures have on average gone up by 1.3 degrees Celsius (or over 2 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1950, according to <!-- -->Roxy Mathew Koll<!-- -->, a climate scientist with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. In an already hot tropical city — often above 90 degrees Fahrenheit and very humid in the summer — that means water evaporates faster and the demand for it rises.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The seeds of the crisis can be found in Velachery, a neighborhood named after one of Chennai’s many lakes. The lake was once deep and wide, but as the city grew, portions of it were filled in 20 years ago to make room for private homes. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">P. Jeevantham was one of the first residents in Velachery when it was developed. He built a slender, three-story apartment building, and manages a tiny shop selling everyday provisions on the ground floor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What remained of the lake was deep and clean back then. That didn’t last for long. Because the city’s water supply was erratic, Mr. Jeevantham drilled <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.indiawaterportal.org/topics/borewells-and-tubewells\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a bore well</a> to draw up water from the aquifer beneath Chennai. So did all his neighbors, up and down the block. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today, Mr. Jeevantham, 60, runs his motor seven hours a day to satisfy the needs of his own family of four and their tenants. It slurps water from 80 feet under the ground, slowly draining from the lake. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The lake is God’s gift,” he marveled. But for how much longer? This, he didn\\'t know. “Maybe five years,” he said, laughing uncomfortably. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today the lake is a shallow, gray-green oasis, bordered on the edges by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/sep/27/hyacinth-invades-velachery-lake-again-1663270.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">invasive weeds</a> and trash, including, in one corner, a black and yellow, broken-down rickshaw.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Near the city center, the groundwater is nearly gone. <!-- -->Dev Anand, 30, <!-- -->still lives in his childhood home in the Anna Nagar area. For much of his life, his family relied on what city water came through the pipes. When that wasn’t enough, they drew water from under the ground. This summer, that dried up. For a few weeks, his neighbor shared his water. Then his groundwater dried up too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Anand, who is active with a civil society group that raises awareness about water, now relies on city tankers. He calls, complains, waits, worries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The entire <!-- -->neighborhood<!-- --> is on tenterhooks. No one knows when their bore wells will be exhausted. People are still drilling more wells all over the city, draining the aquifer further and faster. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Every now and then comes a sprinkling of pre-monsoon showers. Those, too, seem to leave the city no sooner than they enter it. The water reservoirs have been cleared of silt and trash. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The city says it dispatches more than 9,000 water tankers on any given day, more than ever before; private companies supply another 5,000 tankers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A steady stream of people line up at a public tap outside the city waterworks near Mr. Anand’s house. An auto-rickshaw driver said he came every afternoon with his wife and two children to fill up six big jugs. Men on scooters dangled their water pots on either side. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Everyone has their water-saving hacks. Rinse the rice, then use the water to wash the fish. Empty the dirty dishwater into the potted plants. Never, ever leave the tap running.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Forsake the washing machine, and hand wash everything with two carefully rationed buckets of water. To avoid a fight, fill only four pots when the water tanker arrives. Only once everyone has had their share should you consider going back for more.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And then there’s the air-conditioner. Everyone collects its drip. <!-- --> One day, when Rushyant Baskar woke up after working the night shift and turned on his water pump, a dry wheezing sound was all he heard. The buckets were empty, except the one under the air-conditioner. It was the only water he had.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“At that point, we thought we must get out of Chennai,” said Mr. Baskar, 28, who talks to clients in the United States at an outsourcing center. “It was devastating.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These days, his family increasingly relies on the generosity of neighbors. Someone orders a private water tank and shares. As soon as a city water tanker shows, neighbors text — and the Baskars rush out with their jugs. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is exhausting, all this waiting, worrying and keeping vigil for water. Mr. Baskar said he was sleeping less than usual. His mother said she hadn’t had time to check in with relatives on the other side of town. It used to be that you came to the big city to chase money, Mr. Baskar said. “Now we run after water.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Aruna Chandrasekhar contributed reporting from Chennai.</em></p>',\n",

The Iranian state news agency Al Alam reported that the Revolutionary Guards seized the ship on Sunday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The reports did not identify the tanker or its nationality, so it was not immediately clear whether the statement referred to the Emirati ship, the Riah, which has not been heard from since it was traveling in the Persian Gulf late Saturday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In its statement, the Revolutionary Guards denied Western news reports about a tanker seized over the weekend, the semiofficial <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://en.mehrnews.com/news/147785/IRGC-seizes-foreign-ship-smuggling-1mn-liters-of-fuel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Mehr News Agency reported</a> — an apparent reference to the Emirati vessel, indicating that the tanker seized on Sunday was a different ship.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Iranian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that Iranian forces over the weekend had <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/world/middleeast/iran-oil-tanker.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">come to the aid of a ship in distress</a> and towed it to shore for repairs. The ministry did not identify the ship or the nation it hailed from, making it unclear in that case, as well, whether the vessel was the missing Emirati tanker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There has been widespread speculation that the Riah was taken by Iran. The country has long been at odds with the Emirates and Saudi Arabia, both American allies that support opposing sides in the civil war in Yemen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last year, President Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 pact limiting Iran’s nuclear program, reimposing economic sanctions that had been suspended under the deal. He imposed new sanctions this year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Iranian officials have threatened retaliation, including possible disruption of shipments from the gulf through the Strait of Hormuz, which carries about 20 percent of the world’s oil.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">American officials have <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/world/middleeast/navy-tanker-iran-evidence.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">blamed Iran for apparent attacks on tankers</a> in May and June, which followed the new sanctions that aimed to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/world/middleeast/us-iran-oil-sanctions-.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">cut off Iran’s ability to sell oil</a>, a pillar of its economy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After those penalties were imposed, Iran warned that it would step back from compliance with the deal, and in the past month it <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/world/middleeast/iran-uranium.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">has exceeded the agreement’s limits</a> on the size of its enriched uranium stockpile and on how highly it could enrich the metal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last month, Iran shot down an American surveillance drone that it said had violated its airspace; United States officials said the aircraft was over international waters. In response, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/world/middleeast/iran-us-drone.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Mr. Trump ordered, then called off, a military strike</a> against Iran.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two weeks ago, British forces <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/world/middleeast/oil-tanker-gibraltar-syria-iran.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">seized an Iranian tanker near Gibraltar</a>, charging that it was violating European Union sanctions against Syria.

       " 'japan-fire-animation-studio': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">TOKYO — For the second time in two months, Japan has been shocked by devastating apparent violence in a country that is generally considered one of the safest in the world.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Kyoto police said on Thursday that a 41-year-old man was believed to have ignited a flammable liquid around an animation studio in Kyoto. The resulting fire killed 33 people in what is believed to be country’s deadliest arson attack in three decades.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The fire came just weeks after a man went on a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/world/asia/japan-stabbing-schoolchildren.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">stabbing rampage</a> in a Tokyo suburb, attacking 17 schoolgirls, killing one of them as well as an adult. That rampage, by a 51-year-old man, cast attention to the phenomenon of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/world/asia/japan-hikikomori-recluses.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Japan’s “hikikomori”</a> — adults who are extreme recluses — and their psychological issues.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the studio of Kyoto Animation, which has produced popular shows and movies including “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328739/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Full Metal Panic</a>,” “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1410218/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">K-On</a>” and “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1118804/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Clannad</a>” and has done contract work for the world-famous anime company Studio Ghibli, three dozen people were also injured in the morning blaze.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The man believed to have set the fire, who was hospitalized with burns, was being detained. NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster, said the police planned to question him further after he told them he had splashed flammable liquid near the studio building and set it alight.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Citing the Kyoto police, the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan’s largest mainstream dailies, reported that the man had entered the building screaming “Die!” and then tried to escape, but collapsed on the street outside. He was captured by members of the studio’s staff.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Thursday’s tragedy touched a nerve among the Japanese public, who poured out their grief on social media. The hashtag <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrayForKyoani\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">#prayforKyoAni</a> had 170,000 tweets late Thursday evening.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Arson is rare in Japan, and experts quoted by NHK said it was the worst case since 1989. In 2001, 44 people died after a fire broke out at a crowded gambling club in Tokyo’s busiest entertainment district, but that was ruled accidental.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">80 miles</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">JAPAN</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">Area of</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">detail</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">Japan</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">Tokyo</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">Kyoto</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">Pacific Ocean</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Kyoto Animation was founded by Yoko Hatta and her husband, Hideaki Hatta, in 1981, and most of the studio’s production <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-17/fire-breaks-out-in-kyoto-animation-1st-studio-building/.149097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">takes place in the building</a> that was the site of Thursday’s fire.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Footage of Thursday’s fire from a local television station showed black smoke pouring out of windows of the three-story building, with one side of the building mostly charred black.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The shows and movies that Kyoto Animation produces fall into the category of Japanese cartooning known as anime — a backbone of the country’s popular culture and one of its major soft-power exports.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With roots going back to the early 20th century, anime has found an international following through artists like Hayao Miyazaki, whose feature “Spirited Away” won an Oscar in 2003, and Makoto Shinkai, whose movie “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/04/movies/the-anime-master-of-missed-connections-makes-strong-contact-in-japan.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Your Name</a>” was a global phenomenon, particularly in China.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/shinkaimakoto/status/1151692316958052354\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Twitter</a>, Mr. Shinkai showed his support for the Kyoto Animation staff. “Everyone at Kyoto Animation, please please stay safe,” he said, in a message that was recirculated almost 19,000 times.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also expressed sympathy on Twitter for the victims of the fire.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Today, we had many casualties in a fatal arson attack that happened in Kyoto,” Mr. Abe wrote. “It is so horrifying that I am at a loss for words. I’d like to express my deepest condolences to the victims. I offer my thoughts to those who have been wounded and pray for their recovery, by even one day.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Witnesses who spoke to other Japanese news outlets described grim scenes near the studio. According to the Mainichi Shimbun, another large daily, a woman in her 60s living near the building said she had seen a young woman, her entire body burned, screaming and running into a nearby shop, begging for help.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The witness said the woman was bleeding, her clothing torn and her feet bare. “It took a long time until the ambulance arrived,” the witness told the Mainichi. “All I could do was to spray water over her under the fire department’s instruction. She was eventually transferred to an ambulance.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another witness who was working near the studio when the fire broke out told the Sankei Shimbun that he had seen flames coming from the buildings’ first and second floors and heard screaming. The witness said he had seen a man hanging onto the wall outside the building, and another trying to escape from a first-floor window after breaking it.</p>',\n",

       " 'japan-shinzo-abe-election': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">TOKYO — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is likely to move a step closer to his dream of becoming Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, with his party heavily favored to win a parliamentary election on Sunday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For a clue to that likely win, consider Ko Watanabe, 25, a newly minted software engineer in Tokyo.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Watanabe is not quite sure what Mr. Abe means when he talks about <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/world/asia/japan-constitution-shinzo-abe-military.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">revising the country’s pacifist Constitution</a>. With family from Hiroshima and a great-grandfather who survived the atomic bombing there, Mr. Watanabe does not support Mr. Abe’s plan to restart nuclear plants idled since a devastating earthquake and tsunami caused the Fukushima nuclear plant <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/world/asia/japan-fukushima-nuclear-reactor.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">meltdown</a> nine years ago. He does not believe Mr. Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party has been transparent about a possible shortfall in the nation’s pension system.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet come Sunday, Mr. Watanabe plans to vote for the right-leaning Liberal Democrats, as he has done since he was old enough to go to the polls.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Watanabe, on a lunch break downstairs from his office in a fashionable building in the Tokyo neighborhood of Shibuya, said he was just choosing the most secure option among a lackluster bunch.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After reading up on different party platforms in recent weeks, Mr. Watanabe, who fielded 10 job offers after he graduated with a master’s degree in informatics this spring, admitted that the Liberal Democrats’ agenda is “not clear.” But the agenda of the opposition parties, he said, “is <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">really</em> not clear.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Watanabe is representative of his generation, whose members have been among the strongest supporters of Mr. Abe’s administration.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A recent poll by the left-leaning Asahi Shimbun newspaper showed the Abe administration’s approval rate was 45 percent among respondents under 30, higher than the 35 percent approval rating among those in their 60s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A survey late last month by the Nikkei Shimbun, an economic newspaper, indicated an even wider generational gap, with three-fifths of those in their 20s supporting the Abe administration, compared with 35 percent for respondents in their 60s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although a stunning upset is always possible, polls show the Liberal Democrats leading all other opposition parties in Sunday’s upper house election by large margins. Political scientists say youth support for Mr. Abe’s party comes less from a conservative ideology than from a fear of upsetting the current stability.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although the economy is far from booming, the demographics of a declining population and an aging society have tilted in favor of young workers, who are now hotly sought after in the job market.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since Mr. Abe came to power in 2012, conditions have been largely calm. Memories of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster are not so immediate. For close to two years, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/world/asia/japan-north-korea-missile-warning.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">North Korean missile tests have not been flying over Japan</a>. A new emperor <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/asia/japan-emperor-abdicates-akihito-naruhito.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">was peacefully enthroned </a>earlier this spring. Most young people are not yet worried about their pensions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you have a lot to lose, you cling to the status quo,” said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://gmba.doshisha.ac.jp/en/curriculum/faculty/noriko-hama.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Noriko Hama</a>, an economics professor at Doshisha University Business School. “If you don’t really know what’s going to happen tomorrow, you cling to today.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With stable job prospects, Ms. Hama said, young people “are really keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that this will last forever.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The conservative-leaning young voters in Japan stand in contrast to a more leftward drift in the West. In the 2018 congressional elections in the United States, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/exit-polls\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">voters aged 18 to 44 voted solidly for Democrats</a>, according to exit polls, and in the Brexit vote in Britain in 2016, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/567922/distribution-of-eu-referendum-votes-by-age-and-gender-uk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">young voters were far more likely to vote to stay in the European Union</a> than older voters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the United States, younger voters tend to support Democrats because of “their more liberal social views on issues like the environment, ending income equality, same-sex marriages and racial inclusiveness,” said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/william-h-frey/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">William H. Frey</a>, a senior fellow and demographer in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. Japanese youth, too, tend to express higher support for same-sex marriage and diversity, but that does not translate into large shifts in voting behavior.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Concerns about Japan’s turn toward nationalism or a more <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/world/asia/korea-missile-japan-pacifism.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">aggressive military posture</a> under Mr. Abe do not resonate as much with the young, political scientists say. “The youth are further from the trauma of the postwar tragedy,” said Gregory W. Noble, a professor of comparative political economy at Tokyo University.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Underpinning that complacency is the fact that political activity is rare in Japan. Political teaching is frowned upon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If some teachers teach about the political situation and the students go home and they tell their parents, ‘Today my teacher talked about the Liberal Democrats and the Communist Party,’ the parent will probably call the school to complain,” said Katsuyuki Yakushiji, a professor of media and communications who specializes in politics at Toyo University.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Student activism on campuses is not as fervent as it is in the United States. Political demonstrations tend to be dominated by older generations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Young people are just not active, period,” said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://researchers.waseda.jp/profile/en.dc6cb97c641419259dc3f38b48092915.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Willy Jou</a>, an associate professor of political science at Waseda University. “A lot of young people were active in the 1960s, but most of their demands never found their way into the decision-making process of the government,” which led to apathy among the young.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Four years ago, there was a brief flowering of protest led by young activists who <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/world/asia/japans-lower-house-passes-bills-giving-military-freer-hand-to-fight.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">opposed legislation spearheaded by Mr.<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>Abe to give Japan’s military limited powers</a> to fight in foreign conflicts. But Mr. Abe defied broad public opposition to push through the law, deflating the hopes of those who engaged in activism.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A sense that protest is largely impotent may have turned some young voters off politics altogether — along with broader anxiety about standing out or engaging in conflict.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wakako Fukuda, a co-founder of Students Emergency Action for Liberal Democracy, one of the more prominent youth-led groups during those demonstrations, said young voters have been trained not to ask tough questions or disagree with authority.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“No opinion is the best opinion,” said Ms. Fukuda, 25. “All we do at school is memorize, memorize, memorize and follow the rules of the teachers. No matter how inconvenient or inappropriate it seems, if someone in power says ‘do it,’ we do it. That’s how we grow up.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those who do support opposition parties do so less from grievance with the governing party than to support particular issues. Anna Namikawa, 26, a publicist for a local company in Kameoka City, near Kyoto, said she was trying to choose between two parties because of their energy policies and their stance on plastic waste. But in general, “I’m very optimistic,” she said. “Whenever I’m asked if I have any worries, I’d answer no.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Others are more cavalier. Kenta Hikichi, 23, a career counselor for university students, voted early but could not remember who or what party he voted for — just that he voted against the Liberal Democrats.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Every time I cast a vote for a party that I’ve never heard of,” said Mr. Hikichi, whose aspirational facial hair underscored his youth. “Since nothing is going to change, I don’t want my vote to have much of an influence.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Perhaps one defining characteristic of young Japanese is that many of them simply do not vote. Turnout among those in their 20s and 30s is usually low. And it was only in 2016 that 18- and 19-year-olds <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/10/world/asia/teenagers-in-japan-can-finally-vote-but-will-they.html?searchResultPosition=2&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">were allowed to vote</a>. In that year’s upper house parliamentary election, about a third of those in their 20s turned out to vote. Among the newly enfranchised teenagers, just over half of 18-year-olds voted, while less than two-fifths of the 19-year-olds did.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yuna Matsumoto, 31, who quit working for a real estate company to start her own beauty advice YouTube channel, said she had voted only once. “I have no interest at all,” she said. “Honestly, I was like, ‘Oh, there’s an election happening now?’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She says her husband talks about politics, and if she does vote, she will probably support Mr. Abe’s party.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In the long years that the Liberal Democrats have been the ruling party,” Ms. Matsumoto said, “I’ve never really struggled with my life.”</p>',\n",

       " 'knicks-msg-daily-news-dolan': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Weeks after the Knicks were <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/sports/knicks-daily-news-feud.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">fined by the N.B.A.</a> for barring The Daily News from a news conference, the team’s parent company has become embroiled in a bitter dispute with the newspaper that is cast in unusually personal terms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Wednesday, The Daily News <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-james-dolan-msg-inglewood-lawsuit-deposition-clippers-arena-20190717-vrdv6kg6rbgmbaqcwa2yq3gnv4-story.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">published an article</a> about a long-running battle over a real estate development project in Inglewood, Calif., a city just south of Los Angeles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">James L. Dolan is chief executive of the Madison Square Garden Company, the holding company that controls the Knicks, Madison Square Garden and other venues including the Forum in Inglewood, where the Los Angeles Lakers played for over 30 years before moving to downtown Los Angeles in 1999. Dolan purchased the Forum in 2012.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The article, under the headline “James Dolan and MSG are waging a war on Inglewood over new Clippers arena project,” was critical of a lawsuit Dolan filed against the city of Inglewood and of his efforts to protect his stake in the lucrative Los Angeles concert business.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a bombastic statement emailed to reporters and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/NY_KnicksPR/status/1151479148809981952\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">tweeted by the Knicks public relations account</a> on Wednesday, the Madison Square Garden Company accused The Daily News of animus, saying Dolan had once fired Timothy P. Knight, now the head of Tribune Publishing, which owns The Daily News. In a statement at the time, in 2009, Knight said he had <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/business/media/24paper.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">quit as the publisher of Newsday</a>, which is owned by the Dolan family and based on Long Island.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The dispute comes at a time when hopes for a turnaround by the long-struggling Knicks have been roundly dashed, and a summer that Dolan promised would herald a new era for the franchise has instead highlighted continued dysfunction at the highest levels.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Several<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/sports/basketball/knicks-durant-kyrie-dolan.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> elite free agents</a> — including Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving — hit the market this summer; they all bypassed the Knicks and the allure of calling the Garden their home. Stars clamoring to be traded also ignored Dolan’s team.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With the worst record in the league last season, the Knicks had a strong chance of landing the top draft pick and Zion Williamson, the Duke star who is considered a once-in-a-generation prospect. The lottery gave them the No. 3 pick instead, and they took Williamson’s college teammate R.J. Barrett, whose introductory news conference led to a $50,000 fine against the Knicks for barring The Daily News.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In its statement on Wednesday, the Madison Square Garden Company called the article about the Los Angeles real estate project an “epically overwritten hit piece” and said it was one of many “egregious, personal attacks” by The Daily News.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Robert York, the editor in chief of The Daily News, said that there was “no truth” to any claims of a personal vendetta and that The Daily News’ “sole mission is to accurately report relevant news, and this piece fits the classic definition of newsworthy information.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the Knicks organization has frequently sparred with The Daily News over articles about the team’s poor performance in the past two decades, the rancor has reached a new level with the reporting on Dolan’s legal and financial dealings.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2017, Inglewood entered into an agreement with Steve Ballmer, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, for a new basketball arena near the Forum. Ballmer wants to move the Clippers out of Staples Center, which they share with the Lakers, and into a building he owns.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The next year, the Madison Square Garden Company sued Inglewood and its mayor, James T. Butts Jr., accusing Butts of tricking the company into giving up land that could now be used as part of Ballmer’s arena project. Besides hosting Clippers games, the new arena would potentially compete with the Forum for concerts and other events that come to the Los Angeles area.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">According to The Daily News, during a deposition Dolan gave in the lawsuit last year he said that he had barely known an Inglewood mayoral candidate whom he supported with significant funding and that he had tried to get the Lakers to return to The Forum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Daily News also reported that the Madison Square Garden Company had tried to rally influential entertainment figures to oppose the Clippers plans, and that the company was funding a lawsuit by a community group that claims Inglewood violated the California Environmental Quality Act.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rather than respond directly to The Daily News reporting, the Madison Square Garden Company’s statement called the article “grossly misleading.” No errors in the reporting were cited.</p>',\n",

       " 'kosciusko-belarus-memorial': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">KOSAVA, Belarus — Thomas Jefferson hailed him as the “purest son of liberty I have ever known.” New York named a bridge, a street and swimming pool after him to celebrate his role in the American War of Independence. Poland reveres him as the leader of a late-18th-century revolt against the Russian empire.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So what is Andrej Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a lifelong foe of autocracy, doing at the center of a state-run memorial complex in Belarus — a close ally of Russia that has been ruled for 25 years by the same autocratic leader?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The simple answer is that Kosciuszko — known in Belarus as Kastiushka — was born and raised in the bucolic countryside around Kosava, a small Belarusian town 125 miles southwest of the capital, Minsk.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Tired of being dismissed as an appendage of Russia, denounced as “Europe’s last dictatorship” or, worse still, simply ignored, Belarus is now exalting its most famous local hero.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He is an American national hero and a Polish national hero, but he is our hero, too,” said Irina Semenyuk, the deputy director of the memorial complex. “Thanks to him, people know about us.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That may be overstating things a bit, particularly his status in contemporary America. But Kosciuszko (pronounced “kosh-CHUSH-ko,” not as New Yorkers would have it) was far ahead of most of his European contemporaries in fighting for democracy and human rights.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After architecture and art studies in Poland and France, he traveled to America in 1776, fleeing a doomed love. In Philadelphia, he helped design fortifications to protect the Continental Congress and joined forces fighting the British along the Hudson River.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He then spent two years fortifying West Point, where he was made chief of engineering in 1780. He ended the War of Independence as a brigadier general in the United States Army and a citizen of the new republic.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Back in Europe in the 1780s, he supported liberal reforms in what was then the western fringe of an expanding Russian empire. In 1794, he led an uprising against Russian rule and achieved his greatest military success by defending Warsaw against besieging Russian and Prussian forces for months.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His opposition to serfdom, however, made some, especially nobles, wary of supporting him and the revolt was finally defeated.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jailed for a time in St. Petersburg at Peter Paul Fortress, Kosciuszko was released after the death of Catherine the Great in 1796, and allowed to leave Russia.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">200 miles</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">Estonia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">Russia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">Latvia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">Lithuania</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">Minsk</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">Kosava</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">Belarus</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">Poland</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">ukraine</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The original wooden house where Kosciuszko was born in 1746 burned down in 1944 when Soviet guerrilla fighters, in pursuit of retreating Nazi soldiers, set fire to a nearby palace that had been used by the Germans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the time of Kosciuszko’s birth, this land belonged not to Belarus — which first came into existence in 1918 — but to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which at its height controlled territory from the Baltics to the Black Sea.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many other towns in what is now Belarus have their own claims to fame, like Mir, the birthplace of Louis B. Mayer, the film producer and co-founder of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer or Novahrudak, the ancestral home of President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But none can beat Kosava for the global celebrity of its own native son, after whom Australia named one of its highest peaks and who stands atop a pedestal at the United States Military Academy at West Point.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Poland, nearly every town has a street or square commemorating his struggle against tyranny, particularly the Russian variety. France named him an honorary citizen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ruled from Moscow as part of the Soviet Union until 1991, Belarus for decades showed no interest in celebrating Kosciuszko.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Soviet rulers never liked him much and removed an early statue put up in his honor by Poles in western Belarus. For years, the only statue in his honor was a bust on the grounds of the American Embassy in Minsk.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The post-Soviet Belarus state, too, initially kept him at arm’s length, said Leonid Nesterchuk, a Belarus historian who heads the Kosciuszko Foundation, which has been lobbying since the 1990s for official recognition of Kosciuszko as a Belarus hero.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In recent years, however, the authorities, prodded by Kosciuszko fans, have started viewing him as a useful source of national pride. He entered school textbooks as a local-born giant on the world stage and got a new street named in his honor in Brest, near the border with Poland.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Nesterchuk said that when he first appealed to the government for money to reconstruct Kosciuszko’s house in the 1990s, he was rebuffed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But, despite testy relations between Minsk and Washington, it did not object when the State Department in 2004 gave his foundation $28,000 to build a wooden house on the original stone foundations. The United States last year gave an additional $12,000 for repairs to the thatched roof.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Also last year, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://belsat.eu/en/news/monument-of-tadeusz-kosciuszko-opened-in-belarus-photo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a statue of Kosciuszko,</a> the country’s first such public tribute, was put up outside the replica of the house. The cost of the statue, around $12,000, was raised through a crowdfunding campaign.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A plaque on its base declares the world-renowned champion of freedom “a great son of Belarus land.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The authorities in Minsk pay for the upkeep of Kosciuszko’s birthplace and the salaries of guides. They are also funding the lavish renovation of the nearby palace, a jewel of neo-Gothic architecture, and plan to turn the whole area into a national historical site.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The mayor of Kosava, Leonid Yuditz, a loyal acolyte of Belarus’s authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, said he saw no problem in celebrating an 18th-century champion of democracy, so long as this helps puts his town and country on the map.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Because of him people now come here and leave their money,” he said, noting that foreign tourists, particularly Kosciuszko enthusiasts from neighboring Poland, have been pouring into town and seen what Belarus has to offer — pristine nature, clean air and unusually tidy streets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The mayor, like all officials in Belarus, is particularly proud of his country’s cleanliness, a stark contrast with the filth and disarray that blights many towns and villages in neighboring Russia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More than 35,000 people last year visited the Belarus shrine to the memory of the man who helped George Washington beat the British and then returned home to rally a potent, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising against the Russian czarina.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Belarus’s belated enthusiasm for Kosciuszko has irked some people in neighboring Poland, which views him as a Polish national treasure.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Belarus did not even exist when he was born,” said Veslav Wychodzki, a retiree from Poland who traveled to Kosava recently to pay tribute to Kosciuszko. “This was Polish land. They only put up a statue to him last year and never really talked about him before.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Nesterchuk, the Belarus historian, said: “The Poles say he belongs to them. The Lithuanians, the Ukrainians say the same thing. The Americans, too.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“But I always say that Kosciuszko does not belong to anyone,” Mr. Nesterchuk added. “He belongs to the whole world as a true democrat and a fighter for freedom.”</p>',\n",

Amid a deafening, horrific screech of rupturing metal, more than a million gallons of fuel spilled and exploded.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The blast incinerated most of downtown Lac-Mégantic, Quebec. In a community of just 5,600, 47 people were killed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The scale of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/world/americas/deadly-derailment-in-quebec-underlines-oil-debate.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the disaster</a> on July 6, 2013, not only shocked and outraged Canada, it also raised alarm in towns and cities across the country, where a growing number of trains, laden with oil, explosives and toxic chemicals, were rolling through urban centers day and night.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Canada’s government, and the railway industry, vowed to quickly address people’s fear.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is an unbelievable disaster that has occurred here,” Stephen Harper, the Conservative prime minister at the time, said after inspecting the destruction. “They’ll be investigations to ascertain what has occurred to make sure that it can’t happen again.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And there have been changes — at least on paper.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Railways are now required to look for alternative routes to keep shipments of dangerous goods out of urban areas, but trains filled with risky cargo still rumble day and night through Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Toronto and other cities.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Not much has changed since that night in Lac-Mégantic, either. Six years after the catastrophe, the core of the town remains a wasteland, with much of the once-vibrant downtown a weed lot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> The emotional scars have been slow to heal, too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“People are still afraid,” said Jamie Stearns, who owns a local landscaping business. “Personally, when I hear the whistle of the train, it comes right back — the shivers.”</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Lac-Mégantic derailment came at a time of surging oil and gas production in Canada. It also followed a trend of deregulation that had turned over much in the way of safety oversight to the railways themselves.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In its <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/rail/2013/r13d0054/r13d0054.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">report after the accident</a>, Canada’s Transportation Safety Board portrayed the company responsible, the now-defunct Montreal, Maine and Atlantic, as a threadbare operation at which saving time and cutting costs trumped safety.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the railway’s use of a skeleton crew, vulnerable tanker cars and routes going straight through population centers were all allowed under the country’s regulations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Lac-Mégantic was the violent consequence of a series of policy decisions interacting — whether they were deregulation or privatization or austerity — and the consequence was that there was a steady erosion of safety,” said Bruce Campbell, who prepared several studies on the accident as executive director of the Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives, a research group in Ottawa.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After the accident, Canada’s government did reverse that deregulation trend, increasing its oversight of railways, adding inspectors and introducing new safety rules. And for the first time, railways now must be licensed by Transport Canada to operate. If the regulator finds serious safety violations, it can immediately revoke that permit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the efficacy of some of these changes remains an open question. And one of the most important new rules comes with a loophole enormous enough for train after train to barrel right through.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2016, the government ordered all railways to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/railsafety/rules-996.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">start examining the routes</a> they were using to ship dangerous cargos. They were told to see if they could identify alternative runs using remote rail lines instead of ones threading through urban areas.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In theory, this regulation could help reduce the chances of a deadly accident in a populated area. In practice, however, little has changed on the ground — or, more accurately, in the centers of Canada’s most populous cities.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Locomotives pulling tanker cars heavy with oil, propane and noxious chemicals continue to be a common sight in the hearts of several major Canadian cities. Look up at any time in downtown Winnipeg, and you’re likely to see tanker cars passing by on the city’s busy elevated tracks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Transport Canada, the department responsible for making and enforcing rail regulations, said the railways did not give it reports on how many dangerous-goods trains, if any, they’ve moved away from cities following their obligatory safety reviews.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Canadian Pacific and Canadian National, the two major railways that haul the overwhelming majority of Canada’s rail traffic, referred questions about dangerous cargo in cities to the Railway Association of Canada, their lobbying group. In an email, the association declined to provide any statistics about reroutings,<!-- --> citing “security purposes.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ian Naish, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://naishconsulting.ca/about/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">former director of rail accident investigations at the safety board</a>, who is now a safety consultant, said the number of dangerous goods that have been redirected “is probably zero.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The closing of some rail lines in remote areas to increase efficiency, combined with the fact that many Canadian communities were built around railway tracks, means “there really aren’t any alternatives,” Mr. Naish said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Federal Railroad Administration requires similar reviews of routes with dangerous cargos in the United States. But in a statement, it suggested that dangerous cargo is rarely rerouted because “alternatives may increase overall transit time, require additional handling, or introduce other operational risks.”</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The government’s most notable change after Lac-Mégantic: All tanker cars of the type that crumpled in the derailment have stopped carrying anything that is toxic or can explode or burn.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The cars that ruptured were an old design, called DOT-111, with limited crash resistance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lisa Raitt, who became the transport minister in the Conservative government nine days after the crash, announced that this design would be gradually phased out, and that by 2025, these tankers would no longer be carrying flammable products.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Her successor, Marc Garneau, who took office in 2015 in Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government, twice sped up that schedule, and in January of this year, the goal was met.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Taking the place of many of the old tankers is a new design, with substantial reinforcement and other safety improvements, called <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/business/energy-environment/us-sets-new-rules-for-oil-shipments-by-rail.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">DOT-117</a>. But limitations in crash testing mean that while the new cars promise much on paper, their effectiveness in a real-world disaster remains to be seen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We won’t know for sure until we see how they perform in actual accidents,” said Ms. Fox, of the safety board. “I know that’s not very reassuring.”</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another critical policy change was an order given just weeks after the disaster obligating all trains in Canada to once again carry at least two crew members. That only one worker was operating the Lac-Mégantic train was a major factor in the catastrophe.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the United States, the Federal Railroad Administration recently abandoned a proposed regulation that would have required at least two-person crews on most trains.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Thomas Harding was the lone engineer on the train, which was carrying crude oil from North Dakota to an oil refinery in New Brunswick. Mr. Harding took control of the train in Montreal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Late in the evening of July 5, he stopped for the night in Nantes, a hamlet uphill from Lac-Mégantic, and parked his train on the mainline.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Though exhausted after the journey, Mr. Harding took the laborious step of setting the mechanical hand brakes — a train’s version of an automobile parking brake — on the five lead locomotives, an equipment car and an empty boxcar.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That was the first big mistake. Investigators calculated that Mr. Harding should have also secured the hand brakes on 18 to 26 of the tank cars before retiring to his hotel.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the corner cutting by the solo worker initially didn’t matter. The train stayed put because he had also applied air brakes on the locomotives. Not long after he left, however, a small fire broke out in the lead locomotive. A fire crew extinguished it and, following the railway’s instructions, shut down the engine.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That was the second big mistake. Turning off the lead engine also cut off the brakes’ air compressor, eliminating the pneumatic pressure needed to keep the brakes applied. When the brakes ultimately released about an hour after midnight, the train began rolling downhill for seven miles to Lac-Mégantic, gaining speed all the way.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Making sure that no one now operates a train alone was applauded by safety experts. But requiring multiple crew members is no guarantee runaway trains won’t happen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The number of runaway trains in Canada has increased by about 10 percent over the last decade, with 62 trains taking off on their own in 2017. In February, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/enquetes-investigations/rail/2019/r19c0015/r19c0015.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">three Canadian Pacific employees died</a> when a runaway train that had been parked on a mountain slope in British Columbia flew off a bridge.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hand brakes have not evolved all that much since the 19th century, and applying them is slow, backbreaking work.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Hand brakes are good,” said Ms. Fox. “But they need to have some other defense, because hand brakes can be defective.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There’s little sign, however, that Canadian railways are adopting new technologies, like electronically controlled brakes, that have the potential to stop runaway trains.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The fuel explosion that took 47 lives also destroyed 40 buildings in Lac-Mégantic, a resort and industrial town abutting a scenic lake.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A $150 million decontamination program led to the demolition of another 37 buildings and the removal of 294,000 tons of rubble and soil. Adding to the pain of many survivors, the first thing to be rebuilt at the disaster site were the rail tracks themselves, an important lifeline for the town’s factories<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While new roads now run through the former disaster zone, most of it is barren, filled with underused parking lots.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Driving through the wound that was once downtown remains too painful for many in Lac-Mégantic. In a disaster that killed nearly 1 percent of the town, it’s not a question of if residents knew someone who died, but how many.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Every time I cross this desert, I feel death’s been there, and it’s still there,” said Gilbert Carette, a member of a citizens’ rail safety group formed after the wreck. “The best medicine to heal people’s minds would be to fill this empty place.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For many residents, the most important project is moving the tracks to the northern edge of town. Last year, the federal and Quebec governments agreed to pay for a $100 million rail bypass, but the estimated completion date is four years away.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The town’s reconstruction office does have ambitious <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://reconstruction-lac-megantic.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/plan_action_janvier2016_nouveau_logo-2.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">plans</a> for a new downtown, but Julie Morin, mayor since 2017, said that developers would stay away until the train line was moved. She does not anticipate that anything approaching the old downtown will return for a generation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s really haunting us, cause we’re still living this tragedy,” said Mr. Carette. “People have that feeling that everything is frozen downtown.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The still-desolate landscape also serves as a wrenching reminder for the country as a whole about the risks that come with the railways running through so many towns.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Fox, of the safety board, said the disaster had left a mixed legacy<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It would be unfair to say that no progress has been made,” she said. “But I also think it would be inaccurate to say that we can sit back and relax. Because there’s still more that can be done.<!-- -->”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">The Takeaway</strong>: A concerted push on safety, but trains still pull deadly cargo through downtowns across Canada.</p>',\n",

Popular imagery of volcanoes may imply that these crowning caldrons of liquid fire are common, but there were thought to be only seven contemporary volcanoes on Earth with persistent lava lakes that have been seen to stick around beyond a single eruptive outburst.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, using 30 years of satellite observations, a group of scientists from University College London and the British Antarctic Survey has added an eighth volcano to that list: Mount Michael, a 3,250-foot high stratovolcano on Saunders Island, a frigid outpost a thousand miles from Antarctica, the nearest major land mass.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Monitoring this molten reservoir may improve our ability to somewhat forecast the potential hazards from other volcanoes containing lava lakes that are <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/destinations/africa/democratic-republic-congo/nyiragongo-volcano-hike/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">closer to human populations</a>, said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://geology.byu.edu/Home/content/Faculty%20Directory/jani-radebaugh\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Jani Radebaugh</a>, an expert in planetary satellites at Brigham Young University who was not involved with the study.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mount Michael is an active, sputtering volcano that is largely covered in glacial ice. Its slopes are dangerous, and it has never been summited, which means no one has ever peered into its crater. It’s also so far from civilization that “it’s almost like it’s on another planet,” said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Lopes/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Rosaly Lopes</a>, an expert in planetary and terrestrial volcanology at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who was not involved with the study.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That meant that finding it required satellite observations and analyses. Starting in the 1990s and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027301002372\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">early 2000s</a>, some orbital eyes spotted prolonged thermal anomalies that hinted at a lava lake’s existence, but couldn’t prove it. But improved <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://m.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2019/07/Rare_lava_lake\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">satellite imagery</a> from the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Landsat</a>, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Sentinel-2</a> and the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/aster\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Terra</a> missions and better processing techniques have allowed this lake to be conclusively identified in a report published this month in the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027318305742?via%3Dihub#!\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research</a>. Its thermal signature could be seen throughout the observation period, suggesting the lake is probably persistent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The area is often cloudy, and a seemingly constant volcanic plume conceals the lake most of the time. Fortunately, the team collected enough shots of the lake from 2003 to 2018 that clearly showed a crater floor containing a superheated lake 295 to 705 feet across. The lava is also 1,812 to 2,334 degrees Fahrenheit, with the higher end of that range about <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-hot-a-hawaiian-volcano\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">as hot as lava on Earth seems to get</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This discovery emphasizes the geographic diversity of persistent lava lakes. Others have been found within Ethiopia’s Erta Ale, Antarctica’s Mount Erebus, the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Nyiragongo, Nicaragua’s Masaya, Vanuatu’s Mount Yasur and Ambrym and Hawaii’s Kīlauea.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But even persistent lava lakes don’t last forever, says <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://janinekrippner.weebly.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Janine Krippner</a> of the Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program and who was not involved with the study. Those at Kīlauea and Ambrym have recently drained following <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/12/science/kilauea-hawaii-volcano-eruption.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">prolific eruptions</a>, underscoring that they can be fleeting.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And why some lava lakes persist is not entirely understood. An open and well-connected plumbing pathway from a cache of magma far below right up to the surface seems to be required, and “that condition seems to be very rare,” said Dr. Radebaugh. Researchers hope that Mount Michael might offer more clues to this puzzle.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As significant as this sub-Antarctic lava lake discovery is, the majority of the world’s eruptive activity is thought to be hiding <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/science/deep-sea-volcano.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">deep beneath the oceans</a>. If we want to find more lava lakes, then perhaps the seafloor is another extreme frontier we should be more seriously surveying, Dr. Radebaugh said.</p>',\n",

       " 'lebron-james-rich-paul': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">United Talent Agency, one of the leading representation firms in Hollywood, has joined with the influential N.B.A. agent Rich Paul to create a sports division for the entertainment company.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Paul, who represents LeBron James and 22 other N.B.A. players under his Klutch Sports Group banner, was named the head of U.T.A. Sports on Wednesday. The alliance calls for Klutch, with Paul as chief executive, to operate as United Talent’s sports division while retaining its own branding.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’ve been looking for the right sports opportunity for quite a while,” said Jeremy Zimmer, the talent agency’s chief executive. “We have taken a significant stake in Klutch, but Rich retains very substantial controls because we want it to be his business and we love what he’s doing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Neither side would divulge the amount of the stake, but Paul said “nothing changes” in terms of how Klutch’s basketball business operates and that the investment will enable him “to go out and further build Klutch.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">United Talent Agency represents several high-profile actors, including Angelina Jolie, Kevin Hart, Chris Pratt and Tiffany Haddish, as well companies such as Coca-Cola, General Motors and Delta Air Lines. Yet the firm, which restricted itself to off-the-field sports business until now, said it needs Paul’s muscle as it moves into direct competition with the established sports divisions at U.T.A.’s primary rivals in Hollywood: Creative Artists Agency and William Morris Endeavor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">U.T.A.’s move to recruit Paul to lead its sports division is the latest example of the rising influence that the biggest stars in basketball — and a power-broker like Paul — possess. Players and their representatives are exerting that influence more and more to orchestrate moves to the teams they want to play for, as seen repeatedly this off-season. Increasingly, they are carrying that influence into the entertainment industry. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rather than try to start a sports division from scratch or seek a merge with an entertainment conglomerate to go head-to-head with C.A.A. and W.M.E., U.T.A. has taken the untraditional approach of aligning with the on-the-rise Paul to provide instant clout.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The growing<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>resonance athletes — especially N.B.A. players — have in music, fashion and content creation made adding a sports division an “urgent” priority to Zimmer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“All these things have a connectivity and a power in the culture today like we’ve never seen before,” Zimmer said. “And so, for U.T.A. to be a fully built media company, we had to be directly connected to the athlete — not just through sponsorships and endorsements but directly to them in every aspect of their life in a real way.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The partnership also gives Paul, 37, an entree to Hollywood as his N.B.A. profile is expanding. In June, Paul became the first basketball agent to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated — with the magazine describing him as “the most discussed, admired, loathed, ridiculed, daring and feared” agent in the sport.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For years, Paul’s achievements were often dismissed as a natural byproduct of his close relationship with James, who <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/sports/basketball/lebron-jamess-return-to-cleveland-completes-a-journey-for-rich-paul-too.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">was still a teenager</a> when he befriended Paul. The criticism has occasionally included racial undertones. “Because he don’t wear a suit every day,” <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.si.com/nba/2019/06/12/rich-paul-klutch-sports-group-lakers-pelicans-lebron-james-anthony-davis\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">James told Sports Illustrated</a>, “and he’s black.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Paul, though, has largely tuned out such criticism to steadily build Klutch from a fledgling operation in Cleveland to the point that William Morris also expressed interest in a partnership.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After Paul’s preliminary negotiations with that agency, talks with United Talent quickly progressed over the past two months. Klutch’s deal with U.T.A. was initiated by the investment adviser Paul Wachter, who helped broker Fenway Sports Group’s 2010 purchase of Liverpool in the English Premier League, as well as James’s lifetime deal with Nike. Wachter suggested a union with Klutch to Jim Berkus, a U.T.A. co-founder, who took the idea to Zimmer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Klutch represents all of its N.B.A. clients on and off the floor apart from James, whose off-court deal with William Morris to represent his media company, SpringHill Entertainment, will continue. James founded SpringHill with Maverick Carter, another childhood friend.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The modern athlete thinks differently, and I, as the modern agent, think differently,” Paul said. “Guys want more. Guys want to build separate businesses. I tell our clients all the time that the most money you’re ever going to make in your life is probably going to be doing what you were born to do, but it’s O.K. to think outside the box.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">From a base of four clients when he broke away from Creative Artists Agency in 2012 — Tristan Thompson, Eric Bledsoe, Cory Joseph and James — Paul has established a reputation for connecting with players, fiercely promoting their interests no matter the fallout, and getting his clients what they want.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two of the N.B.A.’s marquee players — Anthony Davis and Draymond Green — left their agents to sign with Klutch in the past year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He’s never afraid to hear his own voice — and neither am I,” Green said of Paul. Green, a Golden State Warriors forward, has emerged as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/19/sports/draymond-green-warriors.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">one of the N.B.A.’s more outspoken players</a> after slipping to the second round of the 2012 draft.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Rich has kind of found that niche for empowering us as athletes,” Green said. “It’s also the underdog mentality — the ‘I’m not supposed to be here’ mentality. There’s a natural connection there.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Paul has closed nearly $290 million in contracts this summer and in excess of $1 billion in contracts since he formed his own company — with $342 million through James’s deals alone. He has teamed with the veteran N.B.A. agent and sports lawyer Mark Termini, a fellow Clevelander who was recruited to Klutch at its inception to lead contract negotiations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Davis finished the 2018-19 season with the Pelicans under a cloud after Paul made a request that he be moved just 10 days before the trade deadline in February. Trade talks with the Lakers went nowhere at first, but Davis ultimately got the trade he wanted in June — after Paul successfully persuaded the Boston Celtics and other suitors to back off. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Paul was painted as a villain as the drama played out.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That just comes with the territory,” Paul said. “There’s nothing I can do about that.”</p>',\n",

       " 'lion-bones-poaching': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An international treaty<!-- --> prohibits the buying and selling of products made from any of the big cat species, save one: the African lion. If the animals have been bred in captivity in South Africa, then their skeletons, including claws and teeth, may be traded around the world.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lion parts legally exported from South Africa usually wind up in Asia, where they are often marketed as tiger parts. This lucrative business is on the rise, and according to recent research a ban enacted by the United States may have helped to ignite it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service banned imports of captive-bred lion trophies. For many lion breeders in South Africa, skeleton exports <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217409\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">were an obvious way to make up for lost business</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Sometimes, you think you’re doing the right thing, but the outcome of your policy decision is that something worse materializes,” said Michael ‘t Sas-Rolfes, a doctoral candidate at University of Oxford in England who has studied the trade in lion bones.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before the ban, South Africa’s breeding and hunting facilities housed over 8,400 captive-bred lions. Many were destined for use in “put and take” hunts in which a captive-bred, sometimes tame animal is released into a fenced hunting camp for a hunter to stalk and shoot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For people short of money and time, these canned hunts, as they are commonly called, can be appealing. Compared to traditional hunts in the wild, canned lion hunts are cheaper, last days rather than weeks, and are guaranteed to produce a high-quality trophy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Americans once comprised at least half of the clientele for canned hunts. But animal-welfare advocates have long criticized the industry as rife with <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://conservationaction.co.za/media-articles/animal-cruelty-charges-laid-against-lion-farmer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">abuse</a> and lacking in any conservation value.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In December 2015, the United States <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ref=endangered-species-act-listing-protects-lions-in-africa-and-india-&amp;_ID=35403\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">added lions to the Endangered Species List</a>, complicating the rules surrounding lion trophy imports. Although Americans were still free to shoot lions in legal hunts throughout Africa, they could bring home the trophy only if they proved that the hunt had benefited lion conservation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">According to the F.W.S., South Africa’s canned hunts do not meet the criteria.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. ‘t Sas-Rolfes and Vivienne Williams, a researcher at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, sought to determine how the American trophy ban and other policy changes <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217409\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">had affected South Africa’s lion breeding industry</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The researchers surveyed 117 facilities that bred, kept or arranged hunts of captive lions. Following the ban, Mr. ‘t Sas-Rolfes and Dr. Williams learned, prices for live lions plummeted by as much as 50 percent. Over 80 percent of respondents said that the ban had impacted their businesses, and many reported laying off staff and euthanizing lions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While most breeders said they had scaled back operations, about 30 percent said they had decided to turn to the international bone trade. Prices for skeletons have risen by more than 20 percent since 2012.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Female skeletons now sell for $3,100 on average, and those of males for $3,700. Skeleton exports more than doubled in the year following the American trophy ban, from 800 to 1,800 lions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Skeleton exports have since been capped. In late 2016, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species mandated that South Africa establish an annual export quota for captive-bred lion parts. In 2017, authorities set a quota of 800 skeletons; officials raised the figure last year to 1,500, but returned the quota to 800 following protests. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most sellers believe that the quota is still too low. Half of the respondents to the survey said they would seek “alternative markets” if quotas constrained their businesses. Frustrated sellers, in other words, threatened to turn to illegal trade.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lion bones already feed illegal markets. One early buyer, for instance, was Vixay Keosavang, a Lao national who formerly <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/world/asia/notorious-figure-in-animal-smuggling-beyond-reach-in-laos.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">headed a major wildlife trafficking syndicate spanning Africa, Southeast Asia and China</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">According to Dr. Williams’ earlier research, Mr. Keosavang <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.wildcru.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bones_of_contention.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">accounted for nine of 16 consignments of 320 lion skeletons</a> sent to Laos in 2009 and 2010.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Keosavang went into hiding after the United States <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/world/asia/us-to-offer-reward-in-wildlife-trafficking-fight.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his network’s dismantling</a>, but other buyers in Vietnam, Laos and Thailand quickly took his place. Intermediaries in those countries now act as go-betweens for customers, obscuring the true number of importers and their identities, Dr. Williams said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She and Mr. ‘t Sas-Rolfes did not investigate what became of lion bones after they were legally imported into Asia. But according to Debbie Banks, a campaign leader at the Environmental Investigation Agency in London, lion bones, teeth and claws are falsely labeled tiger parts and sold.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Tiger products <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/science/animal-farms-southeast-asia-endangered-animals.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">are immensely popular in Asian markets</a>. Lion bones are used to make what’s marketed as tiger bone wine, a luxury, while claws and teeth are turned into jewelry. In at least eight wildlife seizures in China, lion parts were said to be tiger products, according to Ms. Banks and her colleagues.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There’s an assumption that lion has replaced tiger in the market, and therefore there’s a decline of pressure on tigers, but that’s not the case,” Ms. Banks said. “The demand for tiger and other big cats marketed as tiger is so huge that not only is it consuming farmed tigers, but wild tigers are also still being poached.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The legal trade in lion parts “stimulates demand and perpetuates the desirability of these products,” she continued. “So long as there is a demand, there is going to be pressure on the world’s remaining tigers.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a worrying new trend, lions are also falling victim to poachers. Over a five-year span, Kristoffer Everatt, a project manager at Panthera, a conservation organization, documented a 68 percent decline in the lion population in Limpopo National Park in Mozambique, with just 21 lions remaining in 2017.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The majority of the poached lion remains were missing teeth and claws; two were butchered for their bones, as well. “This lion population is now close to a complete collapse,” Dr. Everatt said. Researchers in Namibia and northern Mozambique have also reported finding lions with their faces, paws or toes removed, he added.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since 2016, Kelly Marnewick, a conservationist at Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria, has recorded at least 75 captive-bred lions that were poached. “It’s a bit of a McDonald’s drive-through,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You throw poisoned meat over the fence to lions used to eating from people, the poison kills them quietly, and then you go in and chop off body parts and leave without anyone noticing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The increase in legal lion bone exports <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://bioone.org/journals/African-Journal-of-Wildlife-Research/volume-42/issue-1/056.042.0103/Possible-Relationships-between-the-South-African-Captive-Bred-Lion-Hunting/10.3957/056.042.0103.short\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">is connected to illegal poaching</a>, Dr. Everatt said: “It would be too coincidental for these two things to be happening at the same time and same place without a link. But the problem is, nobody has actually investigated it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Mr. ‘t Sas-Rolfes warned against jumping to conclusions. Researchers are still examining whether and how demand for legal big cat products affects the poaching of tigers and lions, he said. A new ban on lion bone exports may not only fail to curb poaching, but worsen it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Williams believes that only scientifically informed compromise will yield a solution that truly benefits wild lions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Different stakeholders will vigorously claim there’s only one side and here’s what we need to do, but this is a Rubik’s Cube of complexity,” she said. “It’s multi-sided, and everything is interconnected.”</p>',\n",

       " 'lsu-fraternity-hazing-death': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A former student at Louisiana State University was convicted Wednesday of negligent homicide for his role in the hazing death of an 18-year-old fraternity pledge who became extremely intoxicated during an initiation ritual in 2017.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The conviction of Matthew Naquin, 21, of Fair Oaks Ranch, Tex., is the latest example of the hard line increasingly taken by prosecutors when fraternity activities turn deadly, whether from alcohol abuse or physical violence that might have once been dismissed as roughhousing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Prosecutors argued that Mr. Naquin was the ringleader of a hazing event called “Bible study” that required the Phi Delta Theta pledges to chug alcohol if they gave the wrong answer to trivia questions or failed to correctly recite the Greek alphabet. His lawyer said many fraternity members took part in the ritual and argued that Mr. Naquin had been unfairly singled out. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Maxwell Gruver, 18, of Roswell, Ga., died on Sept. 14, 2017, the day after the fraternity event, prosecutors said. He had a blood alcohol content of 0.496 percent, more than six times the legal limit for driving, and had aspirated vomit into his lungs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Naquin could face up to five years in prison when he is sentenced on Oct. 16, said his lawyer, John S. McLindon. Mr. Naquin faces a separate charge of obstruction of justice for allegedly deleting information from his phone, he said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hillar Moore III, the East Baton Rouge district attorney, said in an interview Wednesday that Mr. Naquin “stood out” among the fraternity members who tormented pledges during the activity, which required them to stand in a dark hallway facing a wall while a strobe light flashed and loud music played.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Everyone kept saying he was the one who led everything, who made people drink more, who asked questions,” Mr. Moore said. “This is grain alcohol — this is 180-proof or 190-proof alcohol. It is what they put tissue samples in to study them in a lab, when you have to wear a hood.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The conviction of Mr. Naquin echoed other hazing prosecutions in recent years, including that of a former Florida A&amp;M University student <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/01/us/florida-am-band-member-is-convicted-in-hazing-death.html?searchResultPosition=2&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">convicted of manslaughter in 2014</a> and four former Baruch College students who <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/nyregion/baruch-college-hazing-death-pi-delta-psi.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter</a> in 2013 after they were initially charged with murder.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We want this to send a message to the country that hazing should not exist,” Stephen Gruver, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/crime_police/article_b9656fea-a8bb-11e9-919a-934d661244dc.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Max’s father, told The Advocate</a>, a Louisiana newspaper, outside the courtroom on Wednesday. “It’s dangerous and we have to all work together to bring an end to hazing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Prosecutors argued that Mr. Naquin targeted Mr. Gruver for especially harsh treatment because he did not want him to join the fraternity, while Mr. Naquin’s lawyer argued that the pledge continued to drink of his own accord after the hazing event had ended.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Moore said there was “absolutely no winner in this case.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is difficult for the defendant’s family and it is difficult for the victim’s family,” he said. “We have never alleged that the defendant wanted him dead or wanted to kill him, but his actions led to this young man’s death.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Naquin was one of 10 students arrested after Mr. Gruver died, but he was the only one charged with negligent homicide. He was expelled from L.S.U. in the month after the death. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Three students were charged with hazing, a misdemeanor, the prosecutor said, adding that two had pleaded no contest and would be sentenced on July 26. The third has not yet entered a plea.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. McLindon said his client was considering an appeal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was a hazing event, but there were probably 10 other active members up there that night and at least five of them were handing out alcohol,” he said in an interview. “Matthew didn’t do anything differently from those boys, but he got picked out because he is very loud.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He has a very loud voice and everyone agreed he was the loudest one there,” Mr. McLindon said. “Unfortunately the jurors equated being loud to somehow being a leader and making that jump to criminal negligence.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">L.S.U. was shocked by the death in 2017 and suspended all Greek life activities on campus for several weeks that fall. It also revoked the on-campus registration of Phi Delta Theta until 2033 and convened a task force to study Greek life on campus.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a statement on Wednesday, Ernie Ballard, a spokesman for L.S.U., expressed sympathy for Mr. Gruver’s family and “all those impacted by this trial and the verdict reached today.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Hazing is an irresponsible and dangerous activity that we do not tolerate at L.S.U.,” he said. “These tragedies, and the penalties that follow, can be prevented, and we have been working diligently to put more safeguards, education and reporting outlets in place for our students regarding hazing.”</p>',\n",

       " 'mauna-kea-protest': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Construction was set to begin this week on a giant telescope on the barren summit of Mauna Kea, a volcano on Hawaii’s Big Island, considered the best observatory site in the Northern Hemisphere.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The project, however, has long drawn the opposition of those who say it would desecrate the mountain’s sacred ground.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Wednesday, that opposition had a new face: About 30 Hawaiian elders were arrested as they blocked a road leading to Mauna Kea’s summit to halt the construction, organizers said. They described an emotional but peaceful scene as the elders, who were sitting under tents on the road, were escorted by police officers to nearby white vans while dozens of other protesters chanted and cried. Some had to be carried. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have come to the point in time where enough is enough,” Leilani Kaapuni, one of the elders, said in a phone interview. She said she was arrested for obstruction of a government road but later returned to the blockade. “This mountain is sacred,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A state spokesman confirmed the arrests, but the authorities could not immediately provide numbers of how many were arrested and what charges they might face. Later Wednesday, Gov. David Ige, a Democrat, said at a news conference that he had issued an emergency proclamation that would allow the authorities to better manage roadways and cordon off certain areas on the mountain. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said the protests had created a dangerous situation, that roads were being illegally occupied and that the state would work to ensure the telescope’s construction could begin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With a primary mirror bigger than a basketball court, the Thirty Meter Telescope, which is expected to be the largest in the Northern Hemisphere, has <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/science/hawaii-thirty-meter-telescope-mauna-kea.html?searchResultPosition=6&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">faced opposition for a decade</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Astronomers say the telescope would be able to study planets around other stars and peer into black holes in distant galaxies better than the Hubble Space Telescope. It would be built by an international partnership called the TMT International Observatory, led by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, but also including Japan, China, India and Canada.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The TMT International Observatory declined to comment Wednesday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over the years, activists have staged protests and filed lawsuits to halt the telescope’s construction. Thirteen major telescopes already exist on the summit, and some have said that decades of telescope building on Mauna Kea has negatively affected cultural and religious practices. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last week, a coalition of activists filed a legal challenge in the Third Circuit Court of Hawaii, seeking an injunction against the telescope’s construction.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Protesters had gathered on the road since Friday, after Governor Ige’s July 10 <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/science/hawaii-telescope-tmt-mauna-kea.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">announcement</a> that construction on the telescope would begin this week.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s not clear how that timeline would be affected by the blockade, and Mr. Ige said at the news conference Wednesday that there was no concrete date by which construction was expected to begin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think we are looking at being able to provide safe access of equipment to the site, and we are committed to do that,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As of late Wednesday afternoon, thousands of protesters were still in the area, organizers said, with some blocking the road. It’s unclear whether more arrests are expected.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Kealoha Pisciotta, a protest organizer, said that she and other opponents do not intend to leave the road until the project is halted. She said Wednesday’s arrests were “extremely difficult to watch.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They are our elders,” she said. “They decided rather than having to see their young children and young people being arrested that they were going to take the arrests. They asked everyone to abide by their will to do this, on behalf of the people.”</p>',\n",

       " 'medicare-retire-abroad': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Karen Schirack, 67, slipped on her way into her house in January and broke her left femur in multiple places, she had a decision to make. Should she get surgery to repair the fractured thigh bone and replace her hip near Ajijic, Mexico, where she has lived for 20 years, or be airlifted back to her home state, Ohio, for surgery and rehabilitation?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the number of American retirees living overseas grows, more of them are confronting choices like Ms. Schirack’s about medical care. If they were living in the United States, Medicare would generally be their coverage option. But Medicare doesn’t pay for care outside the country, except in limited circumstances.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Expatriate retirees might find private insurance policies and national health plans in other countries. But these may not provide the high-quality, comprehensive care at an affordable price that retirees expect through Medicare. Faced with imperfect choices, some retirees cobble together different types of insurance, a mix that includes Medicare.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That’s what Ms. Schirack has done. She pays about $3,700 annually for an insurance policy through Allianz that covered her surgery at a private hospital in Guadalajara, about an hour from Ajijic. She also has a medical evacuation policy that would have paid for her flight to the States, if she had opted for that. That policy costs roughly $3,000 for five years. And she pays for Medicare Part B, which she can use for care when she visits family in the United States. (The standard Part B premium is $135.50 monthly.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Schirack has a scar running from her waist to the middle of her thigh, but she no longer needs home nursing care and wrapped up months of physical therapy in June. After five more months of healing, she hopes to be back to normal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Her private plan paid the equivalent of about $20,000 for her surgery. Before she left the hospital, Ms. Schirack had to cover her portion of the total, about $2,400, and bills for other expenses, including blood transfusions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After leaving the hospital, she was responsible for paying for other services — home nurses, physical therapy, medications — and submitting receipts to the insurer for reimbursement. She estimates she has spent $10,000 and has been reimbursed for about two-thirds of that so far.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If she had had surgery in the United States, she might have faced fewer paperwork hassles, Ms. Schirack said, “but all in all, I’m not going to complain.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The quality of health care varies widely by country, as do the services available to foreign residents. And there are quite a few of these transplanted Americans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Between 2012 and 2017, the number of retired workers living in foreign countries who were receiving Social Security benefits grew nearly 15 percent, to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2018/5j.html#table5.j11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">more than 413,000</a>, according to the Social Security Administration. The largest numbers of expatriates were in Canada (nearly 70,000) and Japan (more than 45,000). Mexico was third, home to nearly 30,000 retired American workers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Commercial health care policies for them may provide decent coverage, but people can generally be denied a policy or charged higher rates for medical reasons. The plans may refuse to cover some pre-existing conditions. Ms. Schirack’s policy, for example, doesn’t cover any services related to her allergies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Private policies can be problematic for another reason: They may have age limits. The GeoBlue Xplorer Essential plan, for example, enrolls only people who are <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.geobluetravelinsurance.com/assets/docs/marketing/GeoBlueSelectAndEssentialComparison2014.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">74 or younger</a>, and coverage expires when people turn 84. In contrast, Medicare eligibility generally begins at 65 and continues until a beneficiary dies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And the policies aren’t cheap. A 70-year-old might pay $1,900 a month for an Xplorer Essential plan with a $1,000 deductible, said Todd Taylor, a sales director for GeoBlue. A plan with a $5,000 deductible might run $1,400 monthly. That doesn’t include coverage for services in the United States.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rates may also vary by country. A 67-year-old American living in Costa Rica who buys a midlevel Cigna plan with a deductible of $750 for hospital care and $150 for outpatient care might pay $1,164 a month, said David Tompkins, president of TFG Global Insurance Solutions. The same policy might cost $913 in France. If the person wanted to add coverage for treatment in the United States, the monthly premium would increase to $1,440 in Costa Rica and $1,138 in France, Tompkins said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since medical care is sometimes much less expensive overseas, some retirees opt to pay out of pocket for minor or routine services.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Claudia Peresman, who will turn 63 on Sunday, moved from Stonington, Conn., to San Miguel de Allende in central Mexico in November. On her first night there, she tripped in the bathroom, hit her face on a wall and split her lip. Her neighbors helped her get a cab to a 24-hour emergency room at a hospital about five minutes away, where staff cleaned up the cut and sent her home. She paid the roughly $25 fee in cash.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Peresman recently bought a private insurance plan with a $2,500 deductible, for which she pays about $100 a month.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What I wanted was catastrophic coverage,” she said. “Things are so affordable here that, outside of being admitted to the hospital, I can probably afford it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even when retirees buy a private policy, Medicare is another piece of the puzzle that they have to consider. Once people become eligible for Medicare coverage, they face a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.medicare.gov/your-medicare-costs/part-b-costs/part-b-late-enrollment-penalty\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">10 percent premium penalty</a> for every 12 months that they are not enrolled in Part B, which covers outpatient services. (People who are 65 or older but still covered by an employer plan generally do not face that penalty.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After paying into the Medicare system for decades, typically via payroll taxes, some expats are frustrated that they generally can’t use the program outside the United States. That’s just the way the law is written, an official at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“C.M.S. cannot speak to or speculate on congressional intent,” the official said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And retirees should honestly consider whether they will spend the rest of their lives overseas.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Even if that is their goal, is their health and mobility going to allow them to accomplish that?” said Dr. David Shlim, 70, who treated many expats when he ran a medical clinic in Kathmandu, Nepal, in the 1980s and ’90s. “People should imagine that they may need to come back to the U.S. and ask themselves how are they going to do that and afford that.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rules on whether noncitizens can enroll in a national health plan vary by country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After living in the United States for nearly 30 years and raising a family here, Alberto Avendaño, 61, is moving back to northern Spain in August with his wife, Zuni Garro, also 61. Mr. Avendaño has dual citizenship, and his wife is a United States citizen. The couple can enroll in the Spanish universal health system and receive care there. They also plan to buy a private plan to use if they want to get medical services without a wait, Mr. Avendaño said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Once they turn 65, they may enroll in Medicare as well, Mr. Avendaño said, depending on their circumstances. Their two children live in the United States.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Peresman also has a few years before turning 65 and making a decision, but she is leaning in the other direction. She is worried that the Medicare program may not exist in its current form when it comes time to decide.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’d sign up if it were absolutely free,” she said. “But I’m already paying $100 a month here.”</p>',\n",

       " 'megan-rapinoe-nike-flag': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">sign up here</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> to receive it each weekday.</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Among the many things that the American women’s soccer team got right over the last month was its approach to patriotism.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The players have strongly held views about injustices in the United States, and they didn’t hesitate to express those views. Team members spoke up about sexism, L.G.B.T. issues and President Trump. They never made the mistake of equating patriotism with nationalist jingoism. They understood that free speech is itself patriotic.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the team — and especially its biggest star, Megan Rapinoe — also did something else. They didn’t make the mistake of conspicuously rejecting American symbols during the World Cup. Rapinoe, who had previously knelt during the national anthem, stood for it during the World Cup. (In part, she was responding to pressure from team management, but I still think it was the right move for her own sake.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When progressive protesters reject American symbols, I think they’re making <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/opinion/columnists/kaepernick-nfl-protests-democrats-midterms.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a tactical mistake</a>. For one thing, they take attention away from their specific causes and turn attention toward the question of their patriotism. For another thing, protesting the anthem or the flag needlessly alienates people who otherwise could be won over by substantive arguments.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many civil rights leaders of the 1960s <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/opinion/football-kneeling-winning-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">understood this dynamic</a>. They knew that their critics were going to call them all sorts of insults no matter what — “un-American” and “communist,” as well as racist slurs. But they also recognized that they could help their chances of winning over persuadable Americans by aligning their cause with the country’s stated values, like justice and freedom. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They said, in effect: We are the true patriots, because we want to help America live up to its ideals and create a more perfect union.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In its own<!-- --> <!-- -->way, the women’s soccer team accomplished this same balancing act. “I’m particularly and uniquely and very deeply American,” Rapinoe said during the tournament. “If we want to talk about the ideals we stand for, the song and the anthem and what we are founded on, I think I am extremely American. For the detractors, I would have them look hard into what I am actually saying, the actions I am doing. Maybe you don’t agree with every single way I do it, and that can be discussed. I know I am not perfect.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And at yesterday’s parade in New York to celebrate the team’s championship, the crowd offered a tweak to the usual “U.S.A, U.S.A.!” chant: “U.S.A! <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/opinion/uswnt-world-cup-soccer-pay.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Equal pay!</a>” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">For more …</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/opinion/the-argument-nancy-pelosi.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">On this week’s episode of “The Argument” podcast</a>, I argued that Nike got this balance wrong by deciding not to sell a sneaker that featured an 18th-century American flag. Ross Douthat agreed with me and Michelle Goldberg disagreed, saying the cancellation of the shoe<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>— led by Colin Kaepernick — was the right move. We also talked about the tension between Nancy Pelosi and the new progressives in the House.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/david-leonhardt\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">subscribe here</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.

       " 'mellody-hobson-ariel-investments-corner-office': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mellody Hobson was raised by a single mother and endured economic hardship as a child. The phone was shut off. The car was repossessed. Her family was evicted. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today, Ms. Hobson is one of the most senior black women in finance. She serves on the boards of JPMorgan Chase and Starbucks, and this month was named co-chief executive of Ariel Investments, the largest minority-owned investment firm.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many things contributed to Ms. Hobson’s remarkable rise through corporate America. Her mother’s grit, a rigorous education and a passion for finance all helped. But so did loyalty. Ms. Hobson started at Ariel straight out of college, and has been with the company for nearly 28 years. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The average American has 11 jobs in their lifetime, and I’ve only had one,” she said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When not shepherding Ariel, which manages some $13 billion, she is engaged in her board work and spending time with her husband, the filmmaker and “Star Wars” creator George Lucas.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at Ariel’s offices in New York.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">Tell me about your childhood.</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I grew up in Chicago with a single mother. I’m the youngest of six kids, and my older siblings are much older than me. When your siblings are that much older, you never get to ride in the front seat of the car, you never get the chicken breast. Literally, you’re a child with a bunch of grown-ups.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What did your mother do for a living?</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She was a real estate developer. She had big dreams for herself that fell short. We had a very up-and-down existence. A lot of times, we would just have really challenging times, <!-- -->getting evicted or our phone getting disconnected or our car getting repossessed<!-- -->. I always felt very insecure financially as a child. I was desperate to understand money as a child. I was desperate to be secure. Because I always felt like the rug could be pulled from under me.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What was your education like?</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I went to the Ogden School, which was the first International Baccalaureate school in the United States. I.B. is a type of degree that started in Europe for diplomats’ kids to make sure that their education was consistent as the diplomats moved around the world. It was amazingly challenging, but it was great in a lot of ways.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We were kids, but we were put through some pretty horrific exercises. We had a teacher once in seventh grade who ripped out pages of the phone book and told us to memorize the name, address and phone numbers of one column. It was literally to teach our brains how to find mnemonics to memorize, and it ended up being a great gift.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In eighth grade, one of our teachers gave us all rubber bands. She said, “You have until tomorrow to come up with an alternative use for this.” We were all stumped. The next day, we were just going to go in and say we couldn’t figure it out. And I’m sitting at my desk, and I start rubbing the rubber band against my paper, and I realize it’s an eraser.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What was your first job?</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I worked in a storeroom that had no windows of a very fancy store in Chicago. I put the tags on the clothes. I honestly loved the job. I loved looking at the clothes. I loved the idea that I could make money. I told them I was 16, but I wasn’t. I was 15. I went there with bells on every single day. I would check the merchandise in so fast that I had nothing to do for the rest of the day, so they said to me, “Well, go help the bookkeeper.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then they asked me to start helping close out the register, because I was the one who could get it to balance. Once I was downstairs closing out a register, and a woman came in and she didn’t have anyone to help her, and I sold her thousands of dollars’ worth of clothes. I just thought it was the most amazing thing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was my first real example of making myself indispensable, which was one of the things my mom told me. She was like, “Just make it so you’re so good, you can’t get fired.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What did you study in college?</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I was in the Woodrow Wilson School of <!-- -->international relations and public policy<!-- --> at Princeton. You have to apply to get in, and I did not originally get in. I lobbied really hard and called many people. I just would not take no for an answer. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I spent a lot of my years in the Woodrow Wilson School studying systems that really oppress people. I wrote my senior thesis on South Africa, and specifically on how children ultimately led to the end of apartheid because of their uprisings.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">How did you go from that to finance?</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Finance was right for me because I was desperate to understand money. Money was, in my life, a debilitating topic. It was a source of great worry and anxiety. I thought, “Could I be in a position to help ease people’s burden when they think about money by teaching them?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Because we don’t learn about money in school in America. In high school in America, you can take wood shop or auto, but not take investing. But who whittles in their spare time? No one cleans their own carburetor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Money is a subject that is extraordinarily uncomfortable for a lot of people. Parents have been queried about their comfort level in speaking to children about money, and they say they are more comfortable talking about sex and drugs than money. That comes from their own money anxiety. And interestingly, we inherit our money anxiety. All of our money habits are inherited from our parents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">How did your mom talk about it with you?</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In my life, money was a pervasive topic. My mother was very direct. When we didn’t have any, she told us. She would tell us when we were in trouble. She also made money a part of my everyday life in ways that were very helpful. For example, she always had me pay the check in a restaurant. I knew what things cost. My mother would have me look at bills. I knew what the phone bill was, what the light bill was.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What do you tell people who are starting on their financial journey, wherever they might be?</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I start off by explaining to them that it’s never too late, literally never. I also think the most important thing you can learn about money, and Warren Buffett talks about this, is compound interest. It’s the eighth wonder of the world. If you understand compound interest, you understand money working for or against you. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We talk about long-term patient investing, and that idea that slow and steady does win the race, that time can be your best friend when it comes to investing. That’s why we have a turtle as a logo at Ariel.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">Given your commitment to leveling the playing field for working families, do you advocate for their interests in your board work?</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So let me start with just a fundamental point of view that I have is I believe in capitalism. It is the best system that has existed in the world. Show me a better one. I can’t find it. But I also believe that capitalism needs to work for everyone, and so I don’t begrudge those people who’ve done extraordinarily well in our society as long as it’s a fair fight.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It isn’t always a fair fight, though, and that’s what we need to fix. That could be anything from our tax <!-- -->bases<!-- --> and how that works, our tax rates, to other issues that occur in our society around fair opportunities for education.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I am a person of color who happens to be a woman as well, and I have firsthand dealt with inequality, despite having shown up with all of the credentials. I do not sit here believing that if you’ve just gone to a great school and this, that and the other, it’s all going to be fine. It just doesn’t work like that in our society. I think about those people who were like me and are like me. That goes into the boardrooms that I’m in. I also <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/business/dealbook/mellody-hobson-corporate-diversity.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">think about the people of color</a> who are inside of those companies, making sure they get the same opportunity as those who are in the majority population.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What’s been bugging you lately?</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I am deeply disturbed by children at the border being taken away from their parents. That is sitting on my soul and is very upsetting to me. This is on our watch, and it’s horrific. You’d have to kill me to take my child. Literally, literally kill me. And so the idea that thousands of children have been taken away … I feel like someone is standing on my chest, and I feel like it would be the equivalent of when there was the Japanese internment, or some of the other things that happened where you’re like, “How did that happen?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I don’t want to become numb to it as a society. When people are seeking to escape the oppression that they’re under, whatever it is, economic, social, violence, whatever it is, there’s got to be a better way. This is just not right. It is not right.</p>',\n",

       " 'menstrual-cup-periods-women': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Menstrual cups, little-known devices used by women to manage their periods, are safe and as effective as sanitary pads and tampons, as well as less expensive, according to the first comprehensive analysis of the products. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many women have never heard of menstrual cups; some may know them only by brand names like Diva Cups or Moon Cups. They are flexible, bell-shaped devices made of silicone, rubber or latex that are inserted into the vagina to capture menstrual blood. The cups can be left in place for four to 12 hours before being emptied, rinsed and reinserted. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The researchers did note a handful of cases of toxic shock syndrome linked to use of menstrual cups worldwide. But other factors may have contributed to these infections, and the devices appear to be just as safe as the alternatives, the authors said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Though the patent for the first menstrual cup was issued nearly 100 years ago, the devices have not been widely embraced because of religious and cultural beliefs, and taboos about touching one’s own genitals and coming in contact with menstrual blood.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, with more women talking publicly about menstrual periods, demanding free sanitary supplies in schools and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/tampon-tax.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a repeal of tampon taxes</a>, many health experts think the time has come for the reusable menstrual cup — an eco-friendly alternative to disposable pads and tampons.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The price is right, too: The price of a menstrual cup that can last up to 10 years is about $40 in the United States, although they can be purchased for less. Just one year’s supply of disposable pads or tampons <!-- -->can cost between $60 and $120<!-- -->. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“People like the low cost, as well as the low cost to the environment,” said Dr. Mariana Espinal, a resident in obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale University School of Medicine. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Once a woman has a menstrual cup, Dr. Espinal added, she is never caught short on sanitary supplies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For low-income women who experience so-called period poverty and are unable to afford sanitary products when needed, the cup can be a lifesaver, experts said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Just having access to this reusable product can eliminate some of the struggles girls experience when they can’t leave the house and have to miss school or work because they don’t have sanitary products,” Dr. Espinal said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new paper, published on Tuesday in The Lancet Public Health, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(19)30111-2/fulltext\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">drew on data from 43 studies involving 3,319 participants around the world</a>. The authors found the quality of the evidence disappointing over all and called for more, and more rigorous, research.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, the findings dispel several myths. Most strikingly, menstrual cups are just as effective at preventing menstrual flow leaks as pads and tampons, and perhaps more effective, the investigators found. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They examined four studies that compared leakage of various sanitary products, including cups. Three of the studies found the levels of leakage were similar — and one found that women actually experienced less leakage with menstrual cups than with pads or tampons.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even though new users face a steep learning curve before they master the art of inserting the cup properly, 73 percent of women who started using one said they would like to continue doing so, according <!-- -->to the results of 13 studies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It can be a difficult adjustment at first. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s not as easy to use as a pad,” said Anna Maria van Eijk, lead author of the review and a senior clinical research fellow at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in Britain. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There is a learning curve. It takes some time and getting familiar with your body. And I think it’s very important for people who want to use the cup to be prepared for that.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">New users are often shocked at the size of the devices. Menstrual cups hold just less than one fluid ounce. They come in different sizes, but all are about 1.9 inches high. The rim of the cup, or bell, is about 1.6 inches in diameter.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“People don’t understand their anatomy — they see it and think, ‘It will never fit,’” said Penelope Phillips-Howard, the review’s senior author, also of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. “They don’t realize that actually it’s very flexible. You shape the cup in a certain way in position and fold it so you can insert it, and then it opens up inside the vagina.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If the cup is inserted incorrectly, it will be uncomfortable, and the user should remove it and try to reinsert it, Dr. Phillips-Howard said. It can take two to three months for a woman to become accustomed to the device. (Her own research has found that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/10.3362/1756-3488.2015.003\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">teenage girls in Kenya </a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/10.3362/1756-3488.2015.003\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">preferred menstrual cups to pads</a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.developmentbookshelf.com/doi/10.3362/1756-3488.2015.003\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">.</a>)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And, she said, there is an initial ‘ick’ factor that needs to be overcome.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is just anecdotal, but many girls and women I’ve spoken to say it’s a bit yucky,” Dr. Phillips-Howard said. “Menstrual blood is taboo. It’s not to be seen, not to be talked about. And some people don’t like to touch their bodies. You have to be willing to touch yourself, though it’s not very different from using a tampon.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new analysis found no increased risk of infection associated with the use of menstrual cups. But the authors identified five cases in which menstrual cup users developed toxic shock syndrome, a life-threatening condition caused by the release of toxins from the overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since the total number of menstrual cup users is unknown, however, the authors were not able to estimate the risk compared to other menstrual products, such as high-absorbency tampons, which were once linked to toxic shock syndrome.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The investigators found no adverse effects on vaginal flora from the cup, and no tissue damage in the vagina and cervix.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The review turned up several cases in which women had difficulty removing a menstrual cup and sought help from a professional. There are two types of cups, cervical and vaginal; most of the problems involved cervical cups, which are smaller and harder to reach.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another complication involved intrauterine device contraceptives. The review identified 13 cases in which removing the menstrual cup caused an I.U.D. to become dislodged. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The study also noted small numbers of women who reported other rare complications associated with the device, such as pain, vaginal injuries, allergic reactions and urinary tract complaints. </p>',\n",

Weren’t you terribly lonely?” he mused.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Collins is often the forgotten astronaut on Apollo 11, the one who remained in orbit, 60 miles above the moon in the Apollo command module, waiting for his crewmates, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, to return from the lunar surface. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He did not mind his solitary time aboard the spacecraft, which was named Columbia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I had this beautiful little domain,” Mr. Collins said. “It was all mine. I was the emperor, the captain of it, and it was quite commodious. I had warm coffee, even.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Unlike half a billion people on Earth, Mr. Collins did not see the broadcast of Mr. Armstrong’s first steps on the moon. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There was no television in the command module. Even if there were, he would still not have seen it. Mr. Collins was above the far side of the moon at that moment, cut off from all communications, and he missed Mr. Armstrong’s legendary words: <!-- -->“That’s one small step <!-- -->for man<!-- -->, one giant leap for mankind.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Collins spoke of his life as a NASA astronaut in the 1960s in a series of interviews, two with New York Times journalists and one with the playwright J. T. Rogers as part of research for <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://timesevents.nytimes.com/onegiantleap\" title=\"\">a play commissioned by The Times</a>. He discussed other questions he has often been asked, too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was thinking of per diem, you know, how many dollars per mile we’d be paid for this voyage,” he joked.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More seriously, he said he was carefully completing tasks on his checklist. “I was nervous about getting every syllable of it exactly right,” he said. “Because this was going to be the day. This was no fooling around. This was it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I thought it would go well,” Mr. Collins said. “I thought, Neil is a very competent pilot, and the surface as we knew it presented some obstacles but it also presented a lot of nice flat landing zones.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The landing turned out to be more <!-- -->nerve-racking<!-- --> than anticipated when the landing area, thought to be a smooth plain, was strewn with boulders. Mr. Armstrong searched for a clear spot and finally landed with less than 30 seconds of fuel left.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Collins was more worried about their return. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If something went wrong with the lunar module’s ascent engine, Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin <!-- -->might<!-- --> be stuck on the lunar surface or in a crazy orbit; Mr. Collins would try to maneuver to retrieve them. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Collins said that around his neck he had a packet outlining 18 contingency plans. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What happens if they veer this way, that way, the other way?” he said. “Some of them were so outlandish, we never really practiced them.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">“</strong>I was not going to commit suicide. I was coming home by myself. And they knew that,” he said. “I didn’t have to discuss it with them, and they didn’t have to discuss it with me. But it would not have been a good trip home.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Collins recalled that he was not entirely happy to see them. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They were dirty,” he said. “You know, from their knees down, their nice white suits had all this grimy goo on them from the rocks and dust on the moon. And I thought, Oh, I’m going to bring that into the command module; I have to clean everything up.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Mr. Collins says he does not remember what he said as they entered: “I don’t know. I’ve been asked that question so many times that if I ever knew the answer, I’ve lost it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Three days later, the Apollo 11 capsule splashed down in the Pacific. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was just amazed that all those mechanical little bits and pieces worked exactly as advertised,” he said, “and we were able to carry off what John F. Kennedy had told us to do without a hitch.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Collins is 88 years old now. He was 38 when he kept his vigil during the moon landing. All three Apollo 11 astronauts were born in 1930. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We came along at exactly the right time,” Mr. Collins wrote in the 2009 preface to “Carrying the Fire,” his meticulous accounting of Apollo 11 first published in 1974. “Just lucky, the right place at the right time.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Like most of NASA’s early astronauts, he had been a test pilot for the United States Air Force. When he applied to NASA in 1962, he was rejected. He applied again a year later and was accepted. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Astronaut training included trips to the Grand Canyon to learn the basics of geology and survival training in the jungle in case the landing ended far off course. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“When I signed up to be an astronaut, I really did not know and had not asked what some of the training venues might be,” Mr. Collins said. “You know if someone told me I’d be eating iguana lizards in the Panamanian jungle, I would have said, ‘Was that really necessary?’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His first spaceflight was Gemini 10, one of the Apollo precursor missions during which NASA figured out the details of orbital maneuvers like docking.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That he ended up on Apollo 11 was the serendipity of back surgery. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Collins was originally assigned to be command module pilot of Apollo 8, which became the first mission to orbit (but not land on) the moon. But he started having trouble walking, caused by disk herniation in his spine. James Lovell replaced Mr. Collins on Apollo 8. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The surgery was successful, and Mr. Collins was reassigned to Apollo 11.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He could have had a third spaceflight as commander of Apollo 17. But even before Apollo 11 launched, he decided he wanted to leave the program because life as an astronaut took him away from his family. He told <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/14/obituaries/donald-slayton-dies-at-69-was-one-of-first-astronauts.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Deke Slayton</a> of the astronaut office, <!-- -->who had been one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts,<!-- --> “If everything goes exactly as planned, I’m out of here.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After Mr. Collins left NASA in 1970, he served as assistant secretary of state for public affairs and then director of the National Air and Space Museum, overseeing the construction of the current building on the National Mall in Washington.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today, Mr. Collins still remembers the view of the moon as they closed in. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It filled up a whole window, and it was absolutely three-dimensional,” he said. “The lights a lot lighter, the darks a lot darker, the delineation of them so clear. The sunlight was behind, and the sunlight was cascading 360 degrees around the rim of the moon. It made the most glorious spectacle you’ve ever seen in your life.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But it is the view of Earth from 230,000 miles away, blue and white with a smudge of tan, that made more of a mark on him. “The thing that really surprised me was that it projected an air of fragility,” he said. “And why, I don’t know. I don’t know to this day. I had a feeling it’s tiny, it’s shiny, it’s beautiful, it’s home, and it’s fragile.”</p>',\n",

But <!-- -->scientists at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., and the Institute for Basic Sciences in Seoul, have taken imaging a step further, developing a new magnetic resonance imaging technique that provides unprecedented detail, right down to the individual atoms of a sample.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The technique relies on the same basic physics behind the M.R.I. scans that are done in hospitals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When doctors want to detect tumors, measure brain function or visualize the structure of joints, they employ huge M.R.I. machines, which apply a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/well/live/do-mri-scans-cause-any-harm.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">magnetic field across the human body</a>. This temporarily disrupts the protons spinning in the nucleus of every atom in every cell. A subsequent, brief pulse of radio-frequency energy causes the protons to spin perpendicular to the pulse. Afterward, the protons return to their normal state, releasing energy that can be measured by sensors and made into an image.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But to gather enough diagnostic data, traditional hospital M.R.I.s must scan billions and billions of protons in a person’s body, said Christopher Lutz, a physicist at IBM. So he and his colleagues <!-- -->decided to pack the power of an M.R.I. machine<!-- --> into the tip of another specialized instrument known as a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE2yE8SvHmA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">scanning tunneling microscope</a> to see if they could image individual atoms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The tip of a scanning tunneling microscope is just a few atoms wide. And it moves along the surface of a sample, it picks up details about the size and conformation of molecules.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The researchers attached magnetized iron atoms to the tip, effectively combining scanning-tunneling microscope and M.R.I. technologies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the magnetized tip swept over a metal wafer of iron and titanium, it applied a magnetic field to the sample, disrupting the electrons (rather than the protons, as a typical M.R.I. would) within each atom. Then the researchers quickly turned a radio-frequency pulse on and off, so that the electrons would emit energy that could be visualized. The results were described Monday in the journal <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0573-x\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Nature Physics</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a really magnificent combination of imaging technologies,” said A. Duke Shereen, director of the M.R.I. Core Facility at the Advanced Science Research Center in New York. “Medical M.R.I.s can do great characterization of samples, but not at this small scale.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The atomic M.R.I. provides subångström-level resolution, meaning it can distinguish neighboring atoms from one another, as well as reveal which types of atoms are visible based on their magnetic interactions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is the ultimate way to miniaturization,” Dr. Lutz said. He hopes the new technology could one day be used to design atomic-scale methods of storing information, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/quantum-computing-research.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">for quantum computers</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Current transistors are <!-- -->still nearly one hundred atoms wide<!-- --> and need to switch on and off to store a single bit of information in a computer.he ability to corral individual atoms could drastically increase computing power and enable researchers to tackle complex calculations such as predicting weather patterns or diagnosing illnesses with artificial intelligence.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Moving an atom from one location to another in a composite could also change and lead to the development of new ones. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The technique might also help scientists <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://qz.com/1400391/a-new-approach-in-the-hunt-for-alzheimers-drugs-stops-malformed-proteins/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">study how proteins fold</a> and develop new drugs that bind to specific curves in a biological structure.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We can now see something that we couldn’t see before,” Dr. Lutz said. “So our imagination can go to a whole bunch of new ideas that we can test out with this technology.”</p>',\n",

It had been his third attempt in four years to reach the United States to be with his only child, who was living with his sisters in New York. But as days turned into weeks and more than a month passed without his release, the young girl seemed to lose hope, her family said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Around 10:30 p.m. one recent night, Heydi shut herself in a room, saying she wanted to be alone. About an hour and a half later, her aunt, Zoila, gently opened the door to offer her a snack. Maybe some cookies and milk would cheer her up, she thought.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the bed with blue and violet flowered sheets was empty. Zoila peered out the window, and then caught a glimpse of the closet on the opposite end of the room: There was Heydi, hanging from a phone-charging cable that she had fashioned into a noose.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She was unconscious, on the edge of death. She had left no note — nothing to help explain what, of the many things that can lead young people to take their own lives, had prompted her to try to end hers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“She was so smart, it doesn’t make sense why she made a decision like this, a decision so out of character,” said Jessica Gámez, 32, the aunt Heydi lived with in the Long Island hamlet of Brentwood. “I thought she would be safer here with me, safer than in Honduras.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Heydi’s short life story is much like those of thousands of Central American families who have been making their way to the United States over the past five years, petitioning for asylum from the turmoil of their homelands and hoping that the challenges of building a new life in an unfamiliar country will not be greater than the ones they left behind.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Heydi’s mother abandoned the family when she was just 2 months old; her grandparents, who raised her in Honduras, both died — she was among those who found her grandfather dying in the street after he was attacked by gang members. She moved to New York and had the usual challenges of adolescence, going to a new school and learning English. But more than anything else, her family and friends said, she missed her father.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Heydi was so excited when he told her he was coming, I think the idea of her dad being here with her felt like a refuge,” said Erika Estrada, 25, who knew Heydi from their church, the Gospel Tabernacle Church in Brentwood. “She lost her grandparents, her mother left, she had all this daughterly love that she couldn’t put towards her aunts or her uncles, only him,” Ms. Estrada said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The story of American immigration has long been one of split families — a parent travels to the United States to work; children and sometimes spouses are left home. In earlier years, migrant workers would return home at the end of the work season and then cross back. But the fortification of the border that followed the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 and stepped-up security in the years since have made such comings and goings far more difficult. In many families, parents and children remain separated for years, sometimes for a lifetime.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the past year has seen repeated cases of migrant family separations and children detained on the border under President Trump’s strict new immigration policies, the Gámez family’s difficulties spanned three presidential administrations — all of which debated but did not deliver a wide-ranging legal solution for migrant labor in the United States.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Going home to be with a sick parent, attend a funeral or to another emergency: It happens all the time,” said Marty Rosenbluth, a lawyer who represents immigrants at a detention center in Lumpkin, Ga. “Then people get caught when they try to return to the U.S.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What happened to Heydi has been reconstructed through interviews with her father, aunts and uncles, cousins, a family friend and her father’s lawyer, as well as information from the family’s asylum cases, federal court records and immigration authorities.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Heydi grew up in a modest concrete home in El Progreso, a town in northwest Honduras flanked by a mountain range to the east and the Ulúa River to the west. For decades the city was a hub for commercial banana plantations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But by the time Heydi was born in March 2006, El Progreso had also become host to some of the country’s many violent gangs, including MS-13. Gang members often demanded cash payments — “taxes” — from Heydi’s family and others in exchange for guaranteeing their safety.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The instability combined with lack of opportunity led her father, Manuel Gámez, now 34, to head for the United States. In 2007, leaving Heydi behind with his parents, he sneaked across the border and traveled to Long Island, where his sister, Jessica, had settled two years earlier.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Being apart from Heydi for most of her childhood was difficult, Mr. Gámez said, but he made enough as a landscaper to send money to support her.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Heydi returned from her Catholic nursery school, she played with the family dogs or rode a pink bicycle her father had given her, recalled Zoila, another of Mr. Gámez’s sisters. Occasionally, she helped in the small store her grandparents ran from their house, raiding shelves and stealing caramels.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But one day in June 2014, the security in which Heydi’s grandparents had enveloped her was shattered.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After months of rebuffing gang members’ demands that he hand over his small S.U.V., her grandfather was gunned down two blocks from their home. Hearing the commotion, Zoila had rushed outside to find her father sprawled on the ground. Peeling back his cattleman hat, she saw blood seeping from his head, forming a pool on the pavement. Heydi stood at a distance, watching the scene unfold.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Within days of the killing, Mr. Gámez said, he was on a plane back to Honduras.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There was no one there to take care of Heydi or Zoila; my mom was very sick then,” he said. “I thought it might be a risk to go back, but I couldn’t leave them there alone.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About a year later, Mr. Gámez’s mother died of complications from diabetes and, according to her children, heartbreak over her husband’s death. With four of his siblings in Long Island and the fear of further retaliation from the gangs weighing on him, Mr. Gámez decided that Heydi and Zoila must go to the United States to be safe.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He sent Heydi first, in the summer of 2015, deciding to stay behind in Honduras in case she was turned back at the border.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Sept. 25, 2015, after nearly two months in a migrant shelter for minors, the 9-year-old Heydi landed at La Guardia Airport, followed a few months later by Zoila.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Surrounded by seven cousins around her age, Heydi adjusted well to life in America, her aunts and cousins said. Within six months, she learned English, motivated as much by her ambition to succeed in her new school as by her desire to be included in the secret conversations her cousins had in English around their Spanish-speaking aunts and uncles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On nearly daily video calls with her father in Honduras, she began teaching him the basics (“Hello. How are you?”) and chastising him for not learning the language better, since he had lived in the United States. Heydi even taught him some lines for talking to women when he arrived in America, perhaps her way of nudging him to find her a mother, he thought.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“She taught me ‘Are you married? Are you single?’” he recalled. “I would say it and she would laugh and smile, she said my accent was very bad.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Heydi urged her father to practice. He had to prepare for living with her, she said. He assured his daughter that he would arrive soon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In June 2016, based on the threat from gangs to her family, Heydi won asylum, entitling her to live permanently and legally in the United States. Around this time, Mr. Gámez made his first attempt to return to the United States. But the border was much harder to cross than when he had first journeyed to America nine years earlier.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The first time I came I crossed with a big group: It took two days, it was easy,” he said. “But then it became more difficult, much more difficult. There were Border Patrol agents everywhere.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Mr. Gámez was apprehended in McAllen, Tex., he told agents that he feared for his life should he be returned to Honduras. But an asylum officer deemed that his fear was not credible, and he was deported that November.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“How is it that his daughter and sister are both eligible for asylum and he fails?” said Anibal Romero, Mr. Gámez’s lawyer. “He clearly is fleeing for his safety, for the same reasons. This just shows you how this is a flawed system.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In September 2017, immigration officials detained Mr. Gámez near Santa Teresa, N.M., after he had made yet another attempt to enter the country. He was convicted of illegally re-entering, served 45 days in prison and was deported to Honduras a second time in November.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With each failed attempt, Heydi grew more dispirited.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I told her, ‘I can’t be there right now because the law won’t allow me,’” he recalled. “But how do you explain that to a child? How do you explain what laws are to her?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Gámez remained in Honduras, hawking shoes on the side of the road to support himself.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the time Heydi reached the sixth grade this past year, she was developing some crushes. For months she clung to a love note from a classmate, Carlos. “I want you to be my girlfriend and for us to be together forever. Let me know what you think,” it said, its worn edges folded into a perfect rectangle and tucked between assignments in her homework binder.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But she also showed signs of emotional distress. In the same binder, Heydi scribbled a note in the margins of a poem she was studying in her English class. The stanza she marked said, <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">“and the thought of my own / grandmother homeless / in the cold with no place / to pray and be warm / made me sad and depressed.” </em>Heydi wrote: “It reminds me of my own depression.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jessica attributed her niece’s sadness to both the trauma of losing her grandparents and her growing exasperation over whether she would ever be reunited with her father. Heydi often complained to her aunts that everyone else had a mother and a father, but she felt like an orphan.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She started pleading to return to Honduras to be with her father. But Mr. Gámez maintained that Heydi needed to stay in America, where she had won asylum and had educational opportunities that he had never had.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Heydi’s 13th birthday in March, Mr. Gámez promised her he would be with her by her 15th to celebrate her quinceañera, the traditional coming-of-age celebration. But sensing her increasing despondence, he told her he would try to cross the border in June.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The two started to make plans for their first summer together in the United States: They’d go to the mall, to the park, to the small beach by the Bay Shore Marina.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">From Reynosa, Mexico, in early June, Mr. Gámez called Heydi and told her he was almost in the United States. They may not be able to talk for the next few days, he warned her, but he would see her soon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Gámez never had the chance to call her from the other side of the border. After illegally entering the United States, he was apprehended by Border Patrol agents and sent again into detention. When Heydi learned he was in custody, she broke into tears. For days, her aunts said, she did not want to leave her room. She lost her appetite.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jessica thought spending a few nights with Zoila, her younger aunt, might raise Heydi’s spirits. They planned an outing to Six Flags for July 5. But the trip never happened.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At 12:36 a.m. on the morning of July 3, the police responded to a 911 call from Zoila’s house, where medics tried to resuscitate Heydi. She was taken to Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New Hyde Park, where doctors determined she was “neurologically devastated.” A week later, they declared her brain-dead.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On July 13, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agreed to a request from Mr. Gámez’s lawyer, Mr. Romero, to release him from custody to be with his dying daughter. The authorities put him on a plane with a round-trip ticket from Texas, where he will return to detention — he had 14 days to bid Heydi goodbye.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As Mr. Gámez’s flight from Houston approached Newark, Jessica and her siblings waited in the arrivals terminal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He still doesn’t know what happened,” Jessica said, cradling her elbows in her hands. “I still don’t know how I’m going to tell him.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Mr. Gámez emerged, Jessica lunged toward him. “Brother, please forgive me,” she murmured.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the siblings wove through traffic to the hospital, Jessica tried to explain what had happened. But her brother did not fully grasp that his daughter was brain-dead — until he saw her.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She lay in a hospital bed, eyes half-shut, buried beneath breathing tubes and IV drips, surrounded by monitors. His eyes welled.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My dear, my dear, please,” he said softly, stroking the crown of her head. “Please, if you see a light, don’t go toward it, please.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m here, I love you,” he whispered.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Gámez spent the night beside her, the flicker of hope that she might awaken dimming with each monitor’s beep. By morning, the severity of Heydi’s condition had sunk in.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As he sat on the couch in Jessica’s apartment the next day, a look of disbelief and grief washed over his face.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“As a parent, you don’t have any hopes or dreams for yourself, all your dreams are for your kids,” he said. “All my dreams are in her heart. All of them are gone with her.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Thursday, Mr. Gámez plans to take Heydi off life support. They will have spent her last four days alive, together.</p>',\n",

       " 'moldova-eastern-europe-population-decline': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">DOBRUSA, Moldova — Thirty years ago, the village of Dobrusa had about 200 residents. At the start of this year, it had just three.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then two were murdered.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And now there is just one: Grisa Muntean, a short, mustachioed farmer often found in a flat-cap, a checked shirt and a ripped pair of blue trousers held up by a drawstring.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For company, Mr. Muntean has his two cats, five dogs, nine turkeys, 15 geese, 42 chickens, about 50 pigeons, 120 ducks and several thousand bees. The other humans have either died, left for larger towns and cities in Moldova, or emigrated to Russia or other parts of Europe.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The loneliness kills you,” Mr. Muntean, 65, said on a recent afternoon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His former neighbors’ houses are vanishing almost as fast as their owners. With few animals to graze the roadsides, and with only Mr. Muntean to prune the orchards, the buildings are sinking below a canopy of walnut groves and apple trees.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dobrusa (pronounced Doh-BROO-shuh) was once a village of 50 houses that lined two parallel streets at the bottom of a shallow valley. Like many settlements across Moldova, it emptied out after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, an exodus mirrored across Eastern Europe, which has the world’s fastest shrinking population.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now only a few corrugated iron roofs can still be seen in Dobrusa, poking above the undergrowth. They are visible from the dirt track that connects the village to the nearest tarmac road.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">100 Miles</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">ukraine</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">Dobrusa </p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">moldova</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">Chisinau</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">romania </p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">Black</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">Sea</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">Bucharest</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even the village graveyard, set on the other side of the valley, is slowly receding into an undergrowth of nettles and brambles, grass flowers and cow parsley.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Plants like these are the closest Mr. Muntean has to neighbors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“When I work, I speak with the trees,” he said. “With the birds, with the animals, with my tools. There is no one else to talk to.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Until February, Mr. Muntean relied on the company of Gena and Lida Lozynsky, a couple in their early 40s who lived at the other end of the village.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Lozynskys helped Mr. Muntean tend his small holding, and kept an eye on his home when he took his eggs and vegetables to the area market. The trio spoke, at least by phone, on a near-daily basis.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But one Sunday last February, the Lozynskys stopped answering Mr. Muntean’s calls. He heard nothing from them on that Monday. When they failed to call him back on that Tuesday, he assumed he had done something to annoy them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On the Wednesday, after a tipoff, the mayor of the surrounding area, Grigore Munteanu, visited the Lozynskys’ home. In their garden, the mayor found the couple’s cow, its udders unmilked in days. Inside the cottage, he found their half-naked corpses, cold and bloodstained, lying on the wooden floor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An investigation found that the couple had been bludgeoned to death by a drunk laborer, after he and a fellow farmhand had tried to rape Ms. Lozynsky, the mayor said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Six months on, their home is almost as they left it, with clothes strewn on the floor and a box of powdered milk in the front window.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Their garden is already wild. Up on the hillside, their graves are being slowly submerged by the weeds. Within a few years, a visitor may struggle to find the gravestones, let alone remember who was buried there; Gena’s mound is wrongly marked “Gheorghe.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, Mr. Muntean is the last survivor of a village that was first settled in the 19th century, when the area was part of the Russian Empire. According to local folklore, its first residents were Ukrainians who had ultimately hoped to reach the United States (but missed their boat), and Moldovans who had fallen out with a landowner in another area.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The village prospered in the decades after World War II, when Moldova was folded into the Soviet Union. Dobrusa gained a shop, an elementary school, a summer camp for children and a village hall that showed films on Sundays. The collective farm provided work for all in the nearby wheat fields, vineyards and orchards.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/26/world/end-of-the-soviet-union-the-soviet-state-born-of-a-dream-dies.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the collapse of the Soviet Union</a> led to the decline of the collective system and the privatization of the agriculture sector. To find jobs, many Moldovans left their villages — and to find higher salaries, thousands left the country altogether. When Mr. Muntean, who had lived in a neighboring village, arrived in Dobrusa in 2000 to set up a small sheep farm, the village’s population had fallen to around 70, Mr. Muntean reckoned.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Between 1990 and 2015, Eastern Europe’s population fell by 18 million people, to 292 million. About one in four Moldovans lives abroad, according to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.md.undp.org/content/moldova/en/home/blog/2018/making-the-most-of-emigration.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">estimates by the United Nations Development Program</a>, while the resident population fell by 500,000 to 2.8 million between the censuses of 2004 and 2014.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Dobrusa, most of those who remained were pensioners. The school closed in the late 1990s, along with the shop, the camp and the village hall.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It started to feel like a ghost town,” said Valentina Artin, who was born here in 1939. “It was like a desert.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Artin left for the nearby village of Vadul-Leca in 2012 with her grandchildren, leaving no more than 20 residents behind. Then the Ialii family left, and the Petermans. Old Colea Masalkoski passed away, aged somewhere near 100, and so too did Mr. Lozynsky’s mother, Klava.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Muntean’s wife left him; and their four children, who had never actually moved to the village in the first place, emigrated to Spain.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By 2016, Dobrusa had three villagers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even Mr. Muntean’s sheep had gone; with so few villagers to help him, he gave up the sheep farm in 2013. Now even Mr. Muntean is considering leaving for a nearby town himself.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet, for all his loneliness, Mr. Muntean says there is a kind of joy to the peace and solitude. He grows his own vegetables and makes his own honey. He lives among nature, disturbed only by the sound of his geese, in a valley he describes as a kind of heaven.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Besides, Mr. Muntean doesn’t always feel so alone when he sits in his cluttered farmyard — next to his chicken coops, his greenhouses and his broken-down Lada — and gazes up at the village graveyard.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Gena always said he’d be watching over me,” Mr. Muntean said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“And now he is.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Artur Corghencea contributed reporting.</em></p>',\n",

       " 'nate-lashley-british-open': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">SILVIS, Ill. — It’s a short hike from T.P.C. Deere Run’s ninth green to the 10th tee, and Nate Lashley, who was playing in his third tournament in three weeks, was dragging. Lashley paused to greet an octogenarian friend who was following his first round at the John Deere Classic last Thursday, and said, “I should have taken this week off.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lashley had been playing nonstop since the last week of June, when he won for the first time on the PGA Tour, in wire-to-wire fashion in Detroit, in his 33rd tour start since turning professional in 2005.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I had so much adrenaline after Detroit, I figured it could carry me through,” Lashley said, laughing at his logic. “But it ran out pretty fast. I think I’m in my 20s again and I forget I’m 36 years old.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lashley has raised his game after many years meandering through small-town America and PGA Tour Latinoamérica. In the autumn of his career, he is preparing for his first British Open, starting Thursday at Northern Ireland’s Royal Portrush Golf Club, a significant step up from the Opens in Utah, Iowa, Wyoming and Colorado that once anchored his schedule.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s the beauty of golf,” Lashley said. “You never know when you’re going to hit your stride.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lashley, a Nebraska native, will take his place alongside headliners like Tiger Woods, who with a victory can move within two major titles of Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18, and twenty-somethings like Jordan Spieth and Brooks Koepka, who already are multiple-major winners.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But perhaps no one has a more compelling narrative this week than Lashley, who is at the British Open because he won in Detroit, where he was the final alternate, and who, it could be said, was long overdue for a karmic reset.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lashley is a solid ball-striker and a gifted athlete who might have played Division I college basketball, instead of golf, had he not stopped growing at 6-feet-1. His physical gifts have been on display for years, but until recently, he had performance issues rooted in personal tragedy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2004, Lashley’s parents, Rod and Char, and his 19-year-old girlfriend, Leslie Hofmeister, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/01/sports/golf/dream-lives-on-but-the-gallery-is-no-longer-there.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">died</a> when the small plane Lashley’s father was piloting crashed in Wyoming in bad weather. They were on their way home to Nebraska after watching Lashley, then a junior at Arizona, help the Wildcats qualify for the N.C.A.A. tournament at a regional in Oregon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since then, golf has evoked in Lashley complicated, contradictory emotions. He knew his parents would have wanted him to continue pursuing his dream of playing golf for a living, but the sport also, understandably, has triggered within him guilt and anger.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It took a lot of years for me to get over my parents’ deaths,” Lashley said after his win in Detroit. “It was mentally holding me back for a long time.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the players’ dining room inside the clubhouse at T.P.C. Deere Run last week, Lashley’s eyes welled with tears as he shared his frequent thoughts about his parents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Honestly, it’s pretty much everything from wishing my parents were there when I won to not telling them over the years how much I appreciated everything they did for me,” Lashley said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His older sister, Brooke, who played volleyball in high school and for one year in junior college, has tried to put herself in Lashley’s place. What if the last time she saw her parents alive was at one of her matches?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think I would have carried around a lot of guilt,” she said in a telephone interview, “and I think Nate probably does, too, though he has never verbalized that to me.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ricky Romano, who has spent two seasons caddying for Lashley, said he has never asked him about his parents’ death. But last month, on the eve of Lashley’s United States Open debut, at Pebble Beach, Romano mentioned how golf tends to bring out Lashley’s worst side.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lashley was grilling steaks for dinner and was so relaxed that Romano was taken aback.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Romano said he told Lashley, “I don’t know who that guy is out on the golf course that is freaking out all the time.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An even-keeled Lashley carded a first-round, four-under 67 at Pebble Beach.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That was big for my confidence,” said Lashley, who finishedtied for 28th. “It just kind of gave me a feeling that I belong here.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lashley won his next start and hasn’t slowed down. The British Open will be his fifth tournament in six weeks. “When you’re playing well, you want to play,” Lashley said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He had a more practical reason for competing in the John Deere Classic instead of taking the week off to rest before heading overseas.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The tournament offered its players a nonstop charter flight to Northern Ireland with first-class seats at a low-cost-carrier price. That was enough to lure in Lashley, who is used to having to keep his costs down. Before this season he had career earnings of less than $300,000 in PGA Tour events and $542,000 on the tour’s feeder circuits.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was fitting that Lashley’s breakthrough victory in Detroit, and the $1.3 million purse, came at a tournament sponsored by Rocket Mortgage: He has had his real-estate license for more than a decade.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The income he earned flipping houses and buying rental properties helped Lashley weather his lean years on the golf course. So did cost-cutting measures like traveling standby on a commercial pilot friend’s companion passes and staying with host families at tournaments.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lashley took a four-month hiatus from the game at the end of 2012 because he felt burned out, but quitting never seriously entered his mind.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was making money, getting to travel and play golf,” he said. “I felt like as long as I was improving and making money, there’s no reason to stop.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lashley’s persistence was rewarded in 2016 when he won three times on the PGA Tour Latinoamérica circuit to advance to the Korn Ferry Tour, where he won once in 2017 on his way to securing his PGA Tour-playing privileges. His 2017-18 rookie season was cut short after 17 starts because of a meniscus tear in his knee that required surgery.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Detroit, Lashley led after each round. When he stretched his 54-hole advantage to six strokes, his sister decided to fly in for the final day. She was seated in the front row of the bleachers on the first hole, waiting for her brother to tee off, when she overheard two fans talking about him. One said he had been waiting all day to see Nate Lashley because he was someone worth rooting for, and then explained to the other why. When he was finished, he turned to Brooke Lashley and asked if she knew the tournament leader’s story.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nobody knows it better, which is why she can’t wait to join him in Northern Ireland midweek. Nate was set to make his first trip to Europe a few years ago with Brooke. But they canceled their plans after Brooke’s boyfriend, whom they were scheduled to meet up with in Switzerland, died in a freak drowning accident.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After so much tragedy and heartache, the family is finally making it to Europe. “I have just a lot of thoughts about my parents,” Nate Lashley said. “How happy they’d be.”</p>',\n",

       " 'netflix-earnings-subscribers': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Netflix, the streaming juggernaut that has upended the entertainment industry, showed signs of vulnerability Wednesday when it reported that it had lost 126,000 paid subscribers in the United States during the second quarter. It was the first time the company had shed domestic streaming customers since it started its digital service 12 years ago and its shares fell sharply.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The number of those subscribers dropped during a time when the price for Netflix went up. In January, the company announced that it was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/business/media/netflix-price-increase.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">raising its rates</a> by anywhere from 13 to 18 percent, depending on the subscription plan, with the increases hitting existing subscribers in March.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The second quarter is typically Netflix’s weakest time of year, but its performance this time was unusually poor. In its letter to shareholders on Wednesday, the company acknowledged that the higher subscription cost had something to do with its failure to meet second-quarter expectations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Netflix also noted that its second-quarter slate of programming, lacking fresh episodes of two of its original hits, “The Crown” and “Stranger Things,” was not as robust as it had been the previous quarter, which most likely figured in the disappointing results.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In addition to losing domestic subscribers, Netflix significantly undershot the number of customers it had expected to sign up worldwide for the period. The company reported that it had added a total of 2.7 million subscribers for the three months ending in June, well short of the five million expected by investors and down from the 5.5. million it had brought aboard in the first quarter.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Netflix stock fell more than 9 percent in early trading Thursday. Reed Hastings, the chief executive, brushed off the weak second-quarter performance. “Our position is excellent,” he said on a call with analysts after the release of the earnings report.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Netflix forecast that it would add more than seven million subscribers in the current quarter, when the new season of “Stranger Things” was made available.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The company, based in Los Gatos, Calif., tends to raise its prices around every 18 months. It decided on the latest increase at least partly because it <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/business/media/netflix-streaming-competition.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">burns a lot of cash</a>, much of it borrowed, spending wildly on Hollywood talent and lavish promotional events.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Netflix remains the nation’s largest internet television network, with over 60 million paying subscribers in the United States. The company has said it could ultimately bring in as many as 90 million total domestic customers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Globally, Netflix is most likely the largest streaming business, with more than 151 million subscribers. Its future growth will largely come outside the United States, with India representing its best opportunity. Netflix has given up on entering the Chinese market after difficulties with regulators there.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The company’s dominance has prompted more established media giants to embark on streaming services of their own. AT&amp;T, which acquired HBO and Turner Broadcasting as part of its $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner last year, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/business/media/hbo-max-friends-netflix.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">announced plans</a> this month for a streaming service — HBO Max — that will start next year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Walt Disney Company will also go big on streaming, with plans to fill an expansive new streaming product, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/business/media/disney-plus-streaming.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Disney Plus</a>, with franchises like “The Avengers” and “Star Wars.” It will also offer the many television shows and films it picked up when it bought the bulk of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox entertainment empire for $71.3 billion in a deal that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/business/media/walt-disney-21st-century-fox-deal.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">closed</a> in March.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Adding to the competition, Apple is shifting away from its focus on hardware to spend more than $1 billion on Hollywood talent as it enters into the entertainment business with Apple TV Plus. That streaming service, with new content from a roster of talent that includes Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Reese Witherspoon, is scheduled for a fall debut.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s not a zero-sum competition,” Mr. Hastings said on Wednesday. “People will subscribe to multiple shows. I’d wager that most Netflix employees are HBO subscribers.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As part of its effort to ramp up its original offerings last year, Netflix signed <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/business/media/netflix-ryan-murphy.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Ryan Murphy</a>, the prolific producer behind “Glee” and the anthology series “American Crime Story,” to a five-year deal said to be worth nearly $300 million. After wooing him away from 21st Century Fox, the company signed another name producer, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/business/media/shonda-rhimes-netflix-series.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Shonda Rhimes</a>, the creator of ABC’s “Grey’s Anatomy,” giving her a nine-figure deal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Netflix released its second-quarter report a little more than a week after the news that it would lose the North American rights to “Friends,” the NBC sitcom that has had a highly remunerative afterlife in syndication and online.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Friends” was the second-most-watched show on Netflix in 2018, according to Nielsen, which is probably why the company was willing to pay <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/business/media/netflix-friends.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">as much as $100 million</a> to stream the show worldwide in 2019.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Starting next year, American and Canadian customers will be able to find it only on HBO Max, after AT&amp;T exercised an option worth over $80 million a year for a five-year period. Netflix will still have rights to “Friends” internationally.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Also beginning in 2020, Netflix’s North American subscribers will have to go elsewhere for “The Office,” another NBC show that has shown durability as a rerun. NBCUniversal, the show’s owner and another entrant into the streaming competition, grabbed the rights to stream it in North America after agreeing to pay $100 million a year for the next five years.</p>',\n",

       " 'one-small-step-for-man-one-big-step-for-moon-boots': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The most famous shoe print in the world is not on this world at all. It’s on the moon, probably still there in the gray dust.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin took a step forward, backed up, then took a photograph. What he left behind on the moon and captured for the rest of us on Earth remains remarkable in its simplicity and timeless in its evocation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Framed in the photo was evidence of man on the moon,” Mr. Aldrin later wrote in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey9qaUExkAwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=magnificent+desolation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjguZP5vavjAhWDEHwKHduiC-MQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=magnificent%20desolation&amp;f=false\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Magnificent Desolation.</a> “A single footprint, showing in perfect detail a reverse mold of the treads from the bottom of my moon boot.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Aldrin’s footprint is about an inch deep — enough to cast a shadow from the dim sunlight over his right shoulder. It is straight on the sides and rounded at the toes and the heel, the shape of a racetrack. It is filled with lines, like rungs of a ladder, formed by eight flat, straight-edged ribs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Who created such a historic sole? Who decided that straight, thick ribs are exactly what an astronaut needs for traction in the lunar soil? </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A man named Richard Ellis is the person who captured the perfect blend of form and function. More than anyone, he decided what all the footprints on the moon would look like.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Ellis worked as a model maker for ILC Industries, now <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ilcdover.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">ILC Dover</a>, the Delaware company that won the bid to create spacesuits for NASA’s Apollo program. ILC, best known for its Playtex division, also had military contracts for things like inflatable rafts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Part of Mr. Ellis’s job was to take the 80 measurements of the astronauts so that engineers could design their suits. His lasting contribution, however, came from the blue silicone soles of the lunar overshoes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most called them moon boots. They slipped over the shoes worn in the spaceship, like galoshes for the rain.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It wasn’t something that NASA dictated, ‘You have to make the tread look like this,’” said Bill Ayrey, a retired ILC test engineer and longtime company historian. “It was him thinking, ‘What kind of tread would it be? Well, let’s do it like this, with full lines across, and that should keep you from slipping.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“<!-- -->Moon Boot<!-- -->,” a book by David H. Mather about the design, suggests that the sole’s wide ribs were meant to accommodate the ladder rungs of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-the-apollo-lunar-module\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">lunar module</a>, but Mr. Ayrey doubts it. It is more likely, he said, that Mr. Ellis, who worked for ILC for 25 years and died in 2006, just chose to make his job easier.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Maybe Richard’s approach was, ‘I have to make this mold, and I’m going to make it simple, and it probably works fine,’” Mr. Ayrey said. “And it did. It worked just fine.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The tread was no afterthought of shoe design; in the 1960s, soles had become a focus of footwear fashion. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.chucksconnection.com/history1.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Converse made its first All Star basketball shoe</a>, with its complex rubber-sole pattern meant to stick to hardwood, about 50 years before Apollo 11. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the 1930s, Vitale Bramani designed the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://us.vibram.com/company/about/history/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Vibram sole</a>, the “waffle stomper” still popular with hikers and climbers. A trip to any shoe store would have provided Mr. Ellis or ILC and NASA engineers with assorted options to imitate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But there were caveats. Before the Apollo missions, NASA had photos but no soil samples from the moon. The agency was not sure what kind of surface the men would be walking on. Was it deep? Was it slippery? Would it shift like sand or clump like clay? </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In case the lunar soil turned out softer than they anticipated, they wanted something that would spread the weight of the astronaut on a pretty large footprint,” said Cathleen Lewis, the curator of spacesuits and international space programs at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Neil Armstrong took his first step on the moon (soon trampled by subsequent ones), he clung to the ladder. No one was sure how stable the surface was, or if it “would be like quicksand, literally sucking a person down into a quagmire of dust,” Mr. Aldrin wrote. He discovered it was like “powdered charcoal,” and noted that he could create footprints and make out the treads.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So could everyone else.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Though moon boots had a calf-high upper, made of layers of woven stainless steel and high-tech fabrics, which went through several redesigns, the rubber soles and their raised, protective toe barely changed through the entirety of the Apollo program.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Only the last two men to walk on the moon, Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt of Apollo 17, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/boot-left-lunar-overshoe-cernan-apollo-17-flown\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">brought theirs back</a>. Other used boots remain on the moon, left behind to save room and weight for return voyages. Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin tossed their boots from the hatch, like children dumping muddy shoes to the porch.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They probably went much further than a normal toss given the one-sixth gravity,” Ms. Lewis said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The moon boots inspired a generation of off-the-shelf imitators, made mostly for snow. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.tecnicasports.com/usa/company/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Tecnica quickly introduced Moon Boots</a>. A plethora of cheap foam boots followed. Their thick rubber-soled, soft-upper influence is still seen in all-weather gear by brands like <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sorel.com/About-Us_History.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Sorel</a> and in snowboard boots by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.burton.com/us/en/c/mens-snowboard-boots\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Burton</a> and others, not to mention Chanel.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the treads they leave on Earth never match the ones on the moon. Which raises the question: If, someday, humans create a lunar outpost, what will the bottom of our shoes look like?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Would Nike and Adidas fight to get a swoosh or three stripes imprinted into the lunar soil? Would Carhartt or L.L. Bean bid to create a tread design solely for the moon’s environment? And would the boots work on Mars?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is hard to imagine that any would equal the original footprints left on the moon 50 years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The footprint ties into Neil Armstrong’s statement when he stepped out onto the surface — ‘one small step for man,’” Ms. Lewis said. “It’s a reminder that humans were there, that humans explored. And it’s still there.”</p>',\n",

LOUIS — Bryan Garner was homeless and injecting as much fentanyl as he could get his hands on when he found the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.monetwork.org/outreach-center-schedule\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Missouri Network Outreach Center</a>, a community center in an old brick rowhouse in St. Louis that connects people to addiction treatment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Garner, 51, accepted the center’s offer of assistance and has not used any illegal drugs since January.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I really feel like, without this place, I wouldn’t be here now,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But how long the center will survive — and how long Mr. Garner will be able to get free treatment — is in question. The center exists thanks to $3.3 billion in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/training-materials-resources/state-grant-programs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">opioid crisis grants</a>, approved with strong bipartisan support, that the Trump administration and Congress have allotted to states since 2017, when a record 47,600 Americans <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db329.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">died from overdoses</a> involving opioids. The money for treatment, prevention and recovery is the administration’s most tangible contribution to addressing the opioid epidemic, and a rare example of an initiative that has received almost full bipartisan support in Washington during President Trump’s tenure.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But even as Mr. Trump has started to claim victory over the epidemic, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-rx-drug-abuse-heroin-summit-atlanta-ga/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">citing “results that are unbelievable”</a> at a drug abuse summit in April, neither he nor his administration’s top health officials have talked publicly about extending the funding beyond next year, when it is scheduled to run out. Many in the addiction field fear that, with opioid overdose deaths finally beginning to level off, and other problems like high prescription drug costs emerging as campaign issues, the attention to treatment will dissipate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’ve been in this field over 35 years, and I’ve never seen an investment like this,” said Mark Stringer, the director of the Missouri Department of Mental Health. “Our plea would be for it to continue.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Department of Health and Human Services referred questions about the future of the grants to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which oversees them. Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz, that agency’s director, was noncommittal. “If I could, I certainly would” continue the funding beyond next year, she said in an interview.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that opioid overdose deaths dropped slightly in 2018, although deaths involving fentanyl, the powerful synthetic opioid that caused a sharp surge in deaths over the past few years, continued to climb. <!-- -->The final month of data for the year is expected to be released this week.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The grants have been especially crucial in Republican-led states that decided not to expand free Medicaid coverage to low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees addiction treatment as an “essential benefit.” Many of these states have been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, and the grants are their main source of financing for treatment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Missouri is quickly exhausting its $65 million share, and other states that have not expanded Medicaid, including Kansas and North Carolina, are in a similar predicament. They have had to spend most of their grant money on medications and doctor appointments — expenses that expanded Medicaid has covered in other states — instead of on other important assistance like housing, recovery services or even naloxone, the overdose-reversal drug.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“When we first heard the money was coming, I remember thinking, ‘Wow, that’s a lot,’” said Nora Bock, who helps oversee addiction treatment programs for the Missouri Department of Mental Health. “Now it’s like, ‘Oh my God, it’s nowhere near enough.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some lawmakers in states that have been hit hard by the opioid crisis are starting to make noise about continuing the funding. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, introduced legislation last month to continue the grants through 2024, at $500 million a year. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, has a bill that would increase the grants to $5.5 billion over five years, Both bills would let states use the money to help people addicted to methamphetamine and other drugs, not just opioids.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My state is a little nervous that Congress is going to say, ‘Gosh, we’ve solved this problem and we can move on,’” Mr. Portman said. “If you take away this foundation we’ve built, the edifice comes crumbling down.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To qualify for the money now, treatment programs must offer at least one of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">three medications</a> that have been approved to treat opioid addiction. Though it is backed by scientific evidence, that approach has nonetheless been rarely used in the past.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the one-time nature of the grants — they were first authorized in 2016 by President Barack Obama, for two years — makes it hard for states to build out permanent treatment systems. The Bipartisan Policy Center noted that problem in a recent <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/library/tracking-federal-funding-to-combat-the-opioid-crisis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">analysis</a>, as did several witnesses at a House hearing on the federal opioid response last month.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In West Virginia, a state that expanded Medicaid but has been devastated by the epidemic, the grant money is “just a patch,” Angela Gray, a public health nurse there, said at the hearing, adding that “without a long-term stable funding commitment and plan, my state will continue to bleed.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here in St. Louis, which has one of the highest overdose death rates of any large city, the need is extreme. Even now, only a fraction of the opioid-addicted population is benefiting from the money: about 5,650 people over the last two years, most of whom were prescribed buprenorphine.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The $230,000 that the MO Network community center that helped Mr. Garner received through the federal grant program this year is paying its rent and funding salaries for three full-time and six part-time employees. The center uses funds from another source to buy and distribute clean needles to people who inject fentanyl and other drugs, which the federal government is prohibited from paying for.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The center’s staff members persuade many people who come for needles or group activities to try treatment — 82 in May. They link them to Assisted Recovery Centers of America, a Missouri company that is the main treatment provider under the state’s grant program.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“People come for needle exchange in the morning, get put in an Uber to a treatment site, get buprenorphine that same day and get put in housing that night,” said Rachel <!-- --> P. Winograd<!-- -->, an associate research professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, who has helped the state plan how to use its allocation. “But boy, does that soak up money fast.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Missouri decided not to use any of its grant funds for residential care or group therapy, opting instead for a “medication first” approach that does not require lengthy initial assessments, counseling, participation in groups or drug-free urine samples as conditions for obtaining medication<!-- -->. The lack of barriers has led to better retention in treatment, Ms. Winograd said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Assisted Recovery Centers, or ARCA<!-- -->, is using grant money to treat about 1,200 patients for opioid addiction in St. Louis and, through telemedicine, in several dozen rural locations throughout Missouri. That is about 40 percent fewer than last year, as the company had to slow admissions to avoid running out of money. It is also providing temporary housing for about 82 of those patients; the state imposed a 45-day limit after it realized how quickly the grant funds were disappearing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“With the volume we are asked to serve, we will be out of treatment dollars again by the middle of August,” said Suneal Menzies, ARCA’s executive director.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nor is Missouri the only state that is struggling to keep up with the need. In North Carolina, where one million people remain uninsured, grant money that was supposed to last until May ran out in February. The state is spending $2 million a month through the program and hopes to have just enough to keep treatment for thousands of uninsured patients going through September.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re digging ourselves out of a meteor-sized hole with a teaspoon,” said Kody Kinsley, a deputy secretary at the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Kansas, too, has struggled. Its grantees ran out of their second year of opioid grant money last fall, months ahead of time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Shane Hudson, president and chief executive of CKF Addiction Treatment, a treatment center based in Salina that has received more than $2 million in grant funds, said that with Medicaid expansion, “these opioid grant dollars could go much further, and we could afford more skilled staff to provide more of these services.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The center is already preparing patients for the likelihood that they will have to take on the cost of their treatment eventually, Mr. Hudson added. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the money has undoubtedly saved lives, many who have benefited from free treatment remain fragile. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One recent morning at ARCA’s clinic on Chippewa Street<!-- --> in St. Louis, Brandi Russell, 37, said she had been receiving buprenorphine through the grant program since January. But she had relapsed on her birthday, in April, after seven weeks of sobriety.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Fentanyl is everywhere in this area — you have no clue,” she said as she waited to see her doctor. “Dealers will come up to you at the gas station, say, ‘Here’s some samples, let me put my number in your phone.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The MO Network recently retrofitted an old ambulance to hand out naloxone and tell opioid users on the streets about free treatment options, including at ARCA. It takes the vehicle out into the community several times a week. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Driving the vehicle past an empty warehouse near the Mississippi River one evening, Aaron Laxton, a social worker, stopped to talk to Albin Martin, 36. Mr. Martin said he had been kicked out of a recovery home 10 days earlier for using fentanyl. He had gone on to overdose twice in the last week, he said, but other homeless individuals had revived him with Narcan.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They said I was completely cold and blue,” he told Mr. Laxton and Chad Sabora, who helped found the group in 2012. Back then, Mr. Sabora said, St. Louis had a five-month wait for any kind of drug treatment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Sabora gave Mr. Martin a card with the MO Network’s phone number. The center gives clients more chances than most other recovery housing options, letting them stay even after they have relapsed several times.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Don’t use alone, O.K.?” he told Mr. Martin as he climbed back into the mobile unit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p>',\n",

       " 'peking-paris-race-motorcar': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Gerry Crown carefully maneuvered himself through the roll cage and into the driver’s seat of his 1974 Leyland and started the engine for the last time before arriving in Paris. Having traveled nearly 8,500 miles across Asia and Europe, only 177 more divided the 87-year-old Australian from victory.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Together with his co-driver, Matt Bryson, 38, Crown was competing in the Peking to Paris Motor Challenge. At 36 days on the road, it is regarded as the longest and toughest race for classic and collectible cars. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I signed up as a chronicler and participant, teaming up with my father, Mario, an automotive engine designer, to race in a 1955 Citroën Traction Avant. We finished in 49th place, but the satisfaction came in just making it to Paris, even though there were times we thought we wouldn’t.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">First run in 1907, the Peking to Paris race was originally intended to test the endurance of the newly emerging automobile. The route between Beijing and Paris had never been driven before; a large chunk of the way was missing roads. Political obstacles made the race impossible in later years, though re-enactments and variations were held from time to time. The road rally enthusiast Philip Young revived the race in 1997, and since 2007 it has taken place every three years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Among the 105 cars that started this year, near the Great Wall of China on June 2, was a 51-year-old Volvo Amazon belonging to Jo and Heather Worth, a mother-daughter team from New Zealand. They were competing in the Peking to Paris for the second time, hoping it would be a slightly less eventful experience than the last. In 2016, they rolled their car during a timed section in Mongolia, when they decided to drive over a hill rather than around it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jo Worth went into the 2019 race with the intention of not getting caught up in the adrenaline and excitement, which in racing is known as red mist. “My strategy was to drive to 80 percent of my ability,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Worth admits, however, that she was driving too fast on the very first timed section when she slid across the road and hit a wall, crumpling her car and with it her dreams of a top-10 finish. Although many thought the Volvo, which she named Xena, was beyond repair, Worth was determined to continue. After a night working on the car with a mechanic and then a full day of driving, an exhausted Worth managed to rejoin the rally in time to cross the border into Mongolia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The participants this year raced through 12 countries, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Estonia and Poland. The route was set by the organization, and each day the competitors used a route book and a GPS device to navigate from start to finish. The teams encountered dirt tracks, river crossings and mountain passes intended to push them and their cars to the limit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For racers like Manuel Dubs, the appeal of Peking to Paris lies in the challenge and the unpredictability of the event. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have to solve problems, which without the rally we wouldn’t have,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For Dubs, this included a wheel breaking off and disappearing into a Russian river, a collision in Kazakhstan with a car not in the race and an engine failure in Germany. Dubs was one of many participants who, in order to keep driving, had to fly someone in with spare parts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although Crown and Bryson also encountered problems, they made it to Paris and clinched their third win in the classics sector. In order to compete with the Datsuns, Porsches and a Ferrari 208 GT4, the Leyland was made as light and reliable as possible in the lead-up to the race.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Crown used to compete in professional rallies when he was in his 30s. While he enjoys the Peking to Paris’s competitive sections, which require a high level of concentration, he thinks that most of the driving is not fun and refers to it as a bit of a slog. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The best part,’’ he said, “is the beer at night.”</p>',\n",

       " 'pierre-cardin-his-mind-has-to-travel': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pierre Cardin has spent a lifetime waging battle, imposing his will and maverick sensibilities on the wayward human form. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“When I design a dress, I don’t design it around a woman’s body,” he once famously said. “I design the dress, and then put a woman inside it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That credo has informed much of the 97-year-old couturier’s prophetic output, on view in “Pierre Cardin, Future Fashion,” a retrospective that opens on July 20 at the Brooklyn Museum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Highlights of the show — they include a 1970 brief roll-collar tunic over a black wool unitard, a 1969 orange and black “armor dress” made of<!-- --> Plexiglas<!-- --> and vinyl, and a 1968 Plexiglas helmet with a face shield — attest to a relevance that persists to this day.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The designer, who experimented early during his six-decade career with synthetic fabrics and gender-neutral fashions, has influenced a swath of his style-world successors, said Matthew Yokobosky, the museum’s senior curator of fashion and material culture. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In relatively recent times that stable included Jean Paul Gaultier, who once worked for Cardin, Karl Lagerfeld, Rick Owens and Stuart Vevers of Coach. Mr. Cardin’s stripped-down aesthetic, Mr. Yokobosky observed, also coincides with a resurgent interest in minimalism.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Inspired by a youthful fascination with the American and Soviet space programs, Mr. Cardin’s signature pieces did not so much move with the body as contain it, forming a kind of carapace cobbled from geometric shapes of silver foil, brightly colored vinyl and Cardine, a Dynel fabric that could be modeled into three-dimensional forms. He mined their properties to lend substance and resilience to his sculptural space age designs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As far back as 1958, Mr. Cardin was putting models in crash helmets matched with tiny plastic skirts and colored stockings, and by the mid-1960s he was dressing men and women in malleable jumpsuits worthy of the Starship Enterprise.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During that decade, his futuristic experiments gave rise to what he christened Cosmocorps, a collection of collarless or roll-neck tops and jackets, some of them spliced with asymmetric zippers. Showcased in Brooklyn are his Cosmocorps jumpsuits and unitards, which doubled as foundation garments worn by both sexes under skirts, elongated vests, codpieces and theatrically outsize jewelry.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His lapel-free men’s suits didn’t sell, Mr. Cardin acknowledged. But his women’s designs, all funnel collars, A-line coats and easy-fitting shift dresses with strategically placed “portholes,” were successful and widely copied. Among them are a minidress and bandeau with circular breast rings, exhibition standouts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A 1969 visit to NASA inspired runway novelties like a blue vinyl necklace and miniskirt accessorized with a clear acrylic visor, and even a line of supersize vinyl goggles. If some of those pieces seem provocative now, that may be because they anticipated the kind of current fashion flying under the banner of gender fluidity. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“For me,” Mr. Cardin told Mr. Yokobosky in an interview for the exhibition catalog, “it was especially important that my creations, regardless of gender, require the body to adapt.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Yokobosky said this week, “Before Cardin we weren’t having this whole discussion of how short can a skirt be, how long can a men’s tunic be? And when do they become the same thing?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Cardin’s most fanciful creations made ingenious use of wire mesh speakers and, in some cases, LED lighting. Screened in the exhibition is a 1962 episode of the animated television series “The Jetsons,” in which Jane, the family matriarch, models a gown, “a Pierre Martian original,” as she giddily proclaims, plugging in an attached electric cord to light up its contours.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Similar midcentury innovations prefigured today’s continuing romance with techno-fabrics: neoprene and lab-generated variations on nylon polyester, to say nothing of textiles that change color like a mood ring.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Cardin’s ardor for interstellar exploration dated from his earliest years. “I anticipated space fashion even before the space conquest became real,” he told Mr. Yokobosky. “When I was a child, I always imagined that man would one day walk on the moon.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A self-professed outlier, Mr. Cardin worked at night in relative isolation, all but oblivious to the work of his contemporaries. “I was never influenced by anyone,” he insisted, except perhaps Balenciaga, whose asceticism he embraced.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I like the clean side of things,” he said. His dresses, he added, “are resolutely modern,” free of excessive ornamentation. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His designs are also, to hear some scholars tell it, resolutely free of erotic charge. “Cardin created a new silhouette that somehow seemed asexual,” said Andrew Bolton, the head curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Sensuality gave way to a robotic severity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Such observations leave Mr. Cardin unfazed. “Clothing is meant to give the body its shape,” he likes to argue. It’s a concept with a future, he suggests. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In 2069, women will wear Plexiglas cloches and tube clothing,” he told Mr. Yokobosky. “Men will wear elliptical pants and kinetic tunics.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Roguishly, he added, “We will all walk on the moon or Mars wearing my Cosmocorps ensembles.”</p>',\n",

When he heard an eclipse was coming, he saw the chance for “a once-in-a-lifetime data set.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Big sagebrush spends much of its life in the sun, and “it covers such a large portion of the country,” from Oregon down to New Mexico, Mr. Beverly said, making it a good subject for study. He and his colleagues chose a patch close to Yellowstone National Park. They set up instruments that could measure photosynthetic rate, as well as the speed of transpiration — how quickly its leaves lose water.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the light faded and the temperature dropped during the 80 or so minutes before totality, Mr. Beverly and his team saw a corresponding decrease in photosynthesis and transpiration. “The plant responded as if it was dusk,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During the two minutes and 18 seconds of complete darkness, both rates fell further. Although they did not quite reach the slowdown level of an average nighttime, it was a much more precipitous drop than would have occurred for a passing cloud.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But when the sun appeared again, the shrubs were blindsided.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That’s when we saw the most evident signals of stress,” said Mr. Beverly. “It caused a disruption in the photosynthetic pathways.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although they could not test this directly, he guesses that the shock of sudden sunlight messed with each plant’s circadian rhythm — the internal clock that determines an organism’s daily cycle of activity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over the course of the eclipse day, the team estimated, your average big sagebrush managed about 14 percent less photosynthesis than it would have if the sun hadn’t been blocked. If a plant is already drought-stressed, an eclipse might be bad news, like “losing 14 percent of a day’s income when you’re already broke,” Mr. Beverly said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Their findings follow a few other studies, including one done during an eclipse over Europe in 1999 that showed changes in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192302001260\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">sap flow</a> and transpiration in a beech tree near Ghent, Belgium. The tree <!-- -->“‘held its breath’ during the solar eclipse,”<!-- --> said Kathy Steppe, now a professor of plant ecology at Ghent University — meaning it stopped releasing water, even as its sap kept flowing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Beverly looks forward to the 2024 eclipse, which will sweep from Mexico through to the Eastern United States, when he plans to take a closer look at crop and tree responses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He’ll do one thing differently: “I would try to use as much automation as possible so I could actually enjoy the eclipse,” he said. “That’s a big thing I missed.”</p>',\n",

Coca-Cola and Pepsi, along with Dow, the plastics producer, support nonprofit groups like Keep America Beautiful, which organize events like litter cleanups. A recent <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3T4b6UKVMI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">video</a> funded partly by Keep America Beautiful featured models dancing through a recycling facility in Brooklyn, which one advertising writer said makes “recycling sexy.” By 2030, Coca-Cola wants all of its packaging to be made from at least 50 percent recycled content.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But one approach to recycling that many of these companies do not support has proved to actually work: container deposit laws, more commonly known as bottle bills, which cost them lots of money.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/state-beverage-container-laws.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">10 states</a> where consumers can collect a few cents when they return an empty bottle or can, recycling rates for those containers are often significantly higher. In some cases, they are more than twice as high as in states without such deposits.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For decades, beverage companies, retailers and many of the nonprofit groups they control have fought to kill bottle bill proposals across the country — with great success. Since 1987, only one state, Hawaii, has passed a bottle bill. This year, such measures have been proposed in at least eight states. <!-- -->Nearly<!-- --> all have been rejected or failed to gain traction. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The result? Recycling in much of the country still depends almost entirely on the good will of consumers to place their used containers in a bin for pickup. The process is convenient, but means millions of bottles and cans head straight to a dump instead. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">[<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">As costs skyrocket, </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/local-recycling-costs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">more cities in the United States are stopping recycling</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.</em>]</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The financial reason for such opposition is clear. If the other 40 states were to adopt expansive bottle bills, it could ultimately cost the industries billions more. The beverage industry says the bills function like a tax and allow governments to collect millions in unclaimed deposits. Beverage distributors, in many cases, also pay a handling fee for the processing of empty containers. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I am confident that the industry’s true rationale for opposing deposit laws is that they cost them money and they don’t want the expense,” said Susan Collins, president of the Container Recycling Institute, a research and advocacy group that supports bottle bills. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most recently, in Connecticut last month, the industry helped to soundly defeat a bill that would have expanded deposits to juice and energy drink bottles, along with soda and beer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s like Groundhog Day all over again,” Chris Phelps, state director of the advocacy group Environment Connecticut, told a<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.greenwichtime.com/middletown/article/Bottle-bill-drastically-scaled-back-13922712.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> local newspaper</a> shortly after the measure was defeated in the state legislature. “Every year when it comes to the bottle bill, every year, no progress is made, despite a lot of effort, a lot of work, a lot of recognition of the need to make progress.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Facing public pressure over its contribution to plastic pollution in the ocean and the problems with many municipal recycling systems, the beverage industry has released broad statements in recent weeks suggesting a new openness to bottle bills.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In response to questions from The New York Times about the industry’s lobbying efforts, the American Beverage Association said in an email that while it had opposed bottle bills “in the past,” it was “open to any ideas” that would create more recycled plastic. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This includes a deposit or fee on our containers,” the trade group said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The industry argues that bottle bills address only one source of plastic waste — soda and water bottles. Beverage companies and retailers say they want to increase recycling rates for all types of plastic, including yogurt containers and food pouches that would be excluded from deposit laws. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bottle bill supporters acknowledge that the systems have flaws, but blame retailers and bottlers for opposing attempts to modernize them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It gets to the larger question about recycling as a whole,” said Darryl Young, a former board member of the National Recycling Coalition. “Is it really just a way for manufacturers to avoid responsibility for their waste<!-- -->?<!-- -->”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Years ago, the National Recycling Coalition considered merging with Keep America Beautiful. Mr. Young said he voted down the deal partly because of concerns about the agenda of the group’s corporate donors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They want to help,” Mr. Young said, “but on their own terms.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Laura Turner Seydel, an environmental advocate and daughter of the media mogul Ted Turner, started a group called Atlanta Recycles in 2005 after learning about what seemed like an absurd conundrum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Recycling rates in Georgia were so low that local carpet manufacturers, a large user of recycled plastic, were forced to import the material from outside the state, even though Atlanta is home to the headquarters of Coca-Cola, one of the world’s largest producers of plastic bottles. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This winter, Ms. Seydel said, she witnessed why, 14 years after she founded Atlanta Recycles, little has changed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It exemplified why the wheels are coming off recycling,” she said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In January, some members of the group — made up of business leaders, government officials and environmentalists — were briefed on a $4 million investment that the Coca-Cola Foundation was making in the city. Coca-Cola, the group learned, had chosen Atlanta to showcase its “World Without Waste” campaign, which centered on increasing collection rates of bottles and cans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The company, through a group called the Recycling Partnership, would pay for city workers to comb through residential recycling bins and leave behind “inspirational scorecards” marking which items could be recycled and which belonged in the trash. The program had been tested successfully on a smaller scale.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Someone in the meeting floated another idea: Why not explore the idea of a bottle bill in Georgia? </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The proposal was quickly shot down. Several members of the group expressed concern that pushing for a bottle bill could jeopardize the funding from Coca-Cola. The message, Ms. Seydel recalled, was “you better let that dog lie.” The discussion at the meeting grew heated. Ms. Seydel and others argued that bottle bills were proven methods to increase collection rates of used plastic. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Kanika Greenlee, the city’s environmental programs director, had come prepared with a statement from Coca-Cola, making clear its opposition to deposits. Bottle bills were inconvenient and costly, the company said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Greenlee, who through a spokeswoman declined to comment, holds several roles related to recycling in Atlanta. She works in the city’s public works department, but she also serves on the national board of directors of Keep America Beautiful alongside executives from Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, Pepsi and the American Chemistry Council, a trade group for chemical and plastics companies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A spokesman for Keep America Beautiful, which the packaging industry helped create in 1953 to combat litter, said the group had a “neutral” position on bottle bills and that “all options at this point need to be on the table” to improve recycling. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a statement, Coca-Cola said company policy positions were independent of its foundation’s donations, adding that the grant had already been awarded when the Atlanta Recycles meeting took place.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are open to exploring a variety of strategies to achieve our goal of recovering and recycling the equivalent of a bottle or can for every one we sell by 2030,” Coca-Cola said, adding that it found curbside recycling was “one of the most effective and convenient recycling solutions for consumers.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Empty bottles have vexed the beverage industry for more than a century. They are “the monstrous evil that saps the life from an otherwise prosperous trade,” The National Bottlers Gazette wrote in 1882.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Back then, beverage companies desperately wanted their bottles back because the glass containers were so expensive to make. The companies even conducted raids on homes to retrieve their used containers from housewives who used them to store ketchup and medicine. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the 1980s, however, mass-produced plastic made bottles inexpensive — and people rarely reused them. They often ended up being tossed on the side of the road, and the beverage companies simply made more of them. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bottle bills were passed partly in an effort to reduce this kind of litter. But states like Tennessee, New Jersey and Washington settled on an alternative. In Tennessee, beverage companies agreed to pay a small tax in order to fund litter pickup efforts, education programs and handouts promoting recycling.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There was another bonus. In many parts of the state, inmates would perform the daily litter cleanup, keeping costs low and rewarding good behavior in the county jails. The tax revenue pays for salaries and other expenses of county sheriffs overseeing the litter crews, like lunch from McDonald’s for the inmates.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It makes the time go easier,” one inmate, Miko Coleman, 29, said as he picked up trash along a quiet country road this spring.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the money — and the cleanup crews — would go away if Tennessee enacted a bottle bill, according to a provision in the law. That has made it difficult for bottle bills to gain traction politically.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I have to hand it to the industry, they have a superior strategy,” said Marge Davis, a writer and conservationist, who has been proposing a bottle bill in Tennessee nearly every year since 2004. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Davis says the litter pickup helps to beautify roads, but does not get at the core issue of recycling more bottles and cans. And even though her bottle bill proposal would find a new funding source for roadside cleanups, she has had a hard time convincing lawmakers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At times, Ms. Davis’ efforts faced another opponent — the group Keep Tennessee Beautiful. Like the work crews, Keep Tennessee Beautiful derives much of its funding from the tax money.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Keep Tennessee Beautiful’s organizational values, according to its website, include “personal responsibility” and “policy based on fact.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For several years, the group circulated research and spoke out against bottle bills. Their argument, presented in a two-page white paper in 2002, mirrored the beverage industry’s position closely. Stopping litter and encouraging recycling are best done through education, it said, not through 5-cent deposits.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Funds should go for prevention education,” the white paper states. “Teach the child and retrain the adult.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Missy Marshall, who has been executive director of Keep Tennessee Beautiful since 2013, said her group does not currently have an official position on deposits, but she worries about upending funding for a system that is successfully reducing litter.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What we don’t think is a positive step is to undo what we are doing,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the industry’s chief criticisms of bottle bills is that they deprive municipal recycling programs of valuable scrap material like aluminum cans. Selling this material helps offset the cost of processing items that are less valuable.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This argument has gained particular credence among environmental groups and municipalities after China put strict limits on the amount of plastic scraps that it imports from the United States. The policy shift in China led to a glut of used plastic and paper around the country, forcing some communities to burn or bury material they cannot offload. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Washington State, Sen. Christine Rolfes thought she had come up with a comprehensive solution. This winter, Ms. Rolfes introduced a bill that she said was intended to hold all plastic packaging manufacturers responsible for the recycling of not just plastic soda and water bottles, but also harder-to-process plastics like takeout containers and packaging wrap.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Representatives of roughly 20 companies and trade groups testified against the bill, including a group called the American Institute for Packaging and the Environment, whose members, according to its website, include ExxonMobil’s chemical division and Pepsico.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They pretty much represented the entire economy,” Ms. Rolfes said of the bill’s many opponents. “It was insidious.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After several revisions, the current version of the bill no longer holds plastic manufacturers responsible for recycling.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The bill, which has been signed into law, now directs a state agency to study different approaches to recycling plastic packaging. The report is due by October 2020. </p>',\n",

That may not sound very surprising given the politics of this blue state, where Democrats hold every statewide office and about three-quarters of the seats in the Legislature. Or given the toll of police shootings on its people: California police officers kill someone, on average, every two to three days — a rate that’s higher than the national average.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lawmakers shelved a bill last year to set a tougher standard for the police to use deadly force. It was inspired by the death of Stephon Clark, who was shot by the Sacramento police in his grandparents’ backyard after officers mistook the cellphone he was holding for a gun. Its failure was in part attributed to the sway police unions have in the Capitol.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[Read more about </em></strong><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/california-today-stephon-clark.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">the Stephon Clark case here.</em></strong></a><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This year, as legislative leaders urged civil rights advocates and law enforcement groups to negotiate, tensions have flared. Demonstrators marched in Sacramento after prosecutors cleared the officers who killed Mr. Clark. Politicians attended the funerals of two officers from the Sacramento region who were killed. And new legislation to regulate the use of force spurred <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://calmatters.org/justice/2019/04/police-shooting-legislation-advances-california-standards-lethal-force-bill/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">emotional public testimony</a> — from Californians whose family members have been killed by the police, lawmakers who served in law enforcement and a sheriff’s deputy who was shot by a man who killed her partner.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Eventually, the negotiations <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://calmatters.org/politics/2019/05/california-police-use-of-force-standards-lethal-shootings-legislature/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">yielded a compromise</a> that supporters say will give California one of the nation’s toughest statewide standards for the use of deadly force.

Gavin Newsom has said he intends to sign it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So what does it do?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The bill says the police can use deadly force only “when necessary in defense of human life.” That means there has to be an imminent threat of death or serious injury to the officer or another person. It’s a steeper standard than prosecutors apply now, which says the police can shoot when doing so is “reasonable.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Importantly, the bill also says the authorities must look at an officer’s conduct leading up to a shooting, including whether the police tried to first de-escalate the situation or use less lethal weapons.

       " 'polio-pakistan-afghanistan': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The global drive to eliminate polio, which has gone on for 31 years and consumed over $16 billion, has been set back again by a surge of new cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As of July 10, there were <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a total of 42 polio paralysis cases in the two countries</a>. They comprise <!-- -->a single large outbreak<!-- -->, because most cases are in the tribal areas along the border, where local people easily cross back and forth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pakistan had 32 of the cases, compared to only three by the same date last year, and the situation is expected to get worse because hot summer weather favors the virus. There were only 12 cases in the country in 2018 and eight in 2017.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For each paralyzed victim — usually a child below age 5 — there are about 200 others who are infected and shedding the virus in their stool, the World Health Organization estimates.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About 20,000 children are born each day in Pakistan. In cities with open sewers, and where <!-- -->other pathogens <!-- -->may attach to the same intestinal receptors that the vaccine does, it can take many doses to fully immunize a child. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last year’s <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/world/asia/pakistan-election-imran-khan.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">hotly contested national elections</a> temporarily threw the program off track as local officials were replaced, said Aziz Memon, head of Rotary International’s polio campaign in Pakistan. Cases have typically spiked during elections and moments of political turmoil, according to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/pakistan-and-the-politics-of-polio/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">an article in The Diplomat</a>, a current affairs magazine focused on Asia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Earlier this year, Pakistan announced that it <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/health/pakistan-vaccination-polio.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">would streamline its national vaccination drive in June</a> in order to make the campaigns faster and less intrusive. Teams would try a friendlier approach and gather less data on the families they visited, the prime minister’s office said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But false rumors spread on social media saying the vaccine had <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/IftikharFirdous/status/1120372934487564290\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">triggered fainting spells</a> — or even that it had killed dozens of children — and many families locked their doors to vaccinators or hid their children.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The issue has split families; The Times of London recently described a Pakistani man returning from work and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/husband-divorces-wife-for-vaccinating-their-family-against-polio-svtxz9kft\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">divorcing his wife on the spot</a> after finding their children’s fingers marked with the indelible ink used by polio vaccinators. Islamic law allows a man to end a marriage by merely saying “I divorce you” three times; he threw his wife and children out of the house. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As in other countries, like Italy, vaccines have become politicized, with opposition parties spreading anti-vaccine rumors. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Babar bin Atta, the prime minister’s special assistant for polio eradication, said in a letter to the Dawn newspaper that population movements and increasing numbers of refusals were hurting the effort.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The country, he said, would try to fix continuing problems with routine immunization, safe water and sanitation, and the high incidence of malnutrition.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Eradicating polio from Pakistan “may take longer than we hoped for,\" he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The virus is threatening to spread to other countries. In May, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.who.int/csr/don/24-may-2019-wild-polio-virus-islamic-republic-of-iran/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a sewage sample in a bordering province in Iran tested positive</a> for the strain of virus circulating in Pakistan; Iran had its last case of polio paralysis in 2001.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A further threat to the eradication campaign is that a few countries — mostly in Africa — have been unable to eliminate some mutated strains of the polio viruses used in live vaccines. Those strains have reverted back into forms capable of causing paralysis. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the last two years, there have been outbreaks of “vaccine-derived polio” in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea and Somalia. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last week<!-- -->, a sewage sample in western China <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">tested positive for a vaccine-derived polio strain</a>, meaning the virus must be circulating there although no cases of paralysis caused by it have yet been detected.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Xinjiang, the province where it was found, borders on both Pakistan and Afghanistan. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Historically, such outbreaks have always been eliminated by the use of injectable killed vaccines, which cannot mutate, and live vaccines that protect against the mutated strains. But the outbreaks in some countries have gone on for many months. </p>',\n",

       " 'premier-lacrosse-league-paul-rabil': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The face of professional lacrosse is bearded and chiseled, a look tailor-made for drawing fans on Instagram and YouTube. It belongs to Paul Rabil, who has long been considered the kind of athlete who could take his sport into the mainstream.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, Rabil finally has that chance — both as a player and co-founder of a new league changing the dynamics of pro lacrosse.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is the biggest opportunity our sport has ever had,” he said. “To seize the spotlight and change both the afterlife of college lacrosse players, the pro marketplace for fans and sponsors, and the culture of the game — what it means to be a pro lacrosse player.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rabil, 33, has scored more points than anyone else in the history of Major League Lacrosse, which had been North America’s top outdoor lacrosse league. That was until Rabil and his brother, Mike, started the Premier Lacrosse League, which began play last month with 160 players, including many M.L.L. All-Stars and members of the United States national team. The new league will have its All-Star Game on Sunday in Los Angeles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Is there demand for such an enterprise? Why would so many players abandon a league two decades old to come along with the Rabils?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The answer is that for most players, professional lacrosse has been a grind, even though they play a rapidly growing sport in front of affluent crowds. Even a star might barely earn $50,000 a year in salary, similar to the average pro football or basketball player in the 1930s or ’40s — when the college version of those sports overshadowed the pro one, much like lacrosse today.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now Rabil wants to let others enjoy what he has — the chance to make a living just from the sport.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most of the pros believe in Rabil, who is offering an average $35,000 in salary for the 14-week season, plus benefits and equity stakes, along with a national TV deal. The P.L.L., Rabil said, will have year-round paid opportunities for its players as well, such as in the P.L.L. Academy, which puts on lacrosse clinics, and at smaller exhibitions and tours.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The migration of players from the M.L.L. to the P.L.L. includes 115 former college all-Americans, 12 college player of the year winners and 10 pro most valuable players.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Money has followed Rabil, too, with the P.L.L. securing financial backing from several big investors. League officials declined to say how much has been staked, but the investments are generally based on the expectation of a return in 10 years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many investors have lacrosse backgrounds. Joe Tsai, a founder of Alibaba Group and an owner of the Brooklyn Nets, played at Yale. David O’Connor, the managing partner of Creative Artists Agency, played at Dartmouth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">O’Connor said the Rabil brothers understood trends toward making sports leagues more player-friendly. “It’s bringing the sport to the right markets with the finest players and event-izing the experience — and it’s proving the model with a great media partnership and top-tier sponsors like Adidas,” he said. “It’s about the very best talent in the game competing at the highest levels, as the game was meant to be played.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The 6-foot-3, 220-pound Rabil has done more on the field than perhaps any other player of his generation: in college, a two-time national champion and four-time all-American at Johns Hopkins; in the M.L.L. and the indoor National Lacrosse League, a three-time champion, two-time M.V.P. and 12-time All-Star; internationally, a World Lacrosse Championship winner and M.V.P.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rabil’s business career began more modestly. After graduating in 2008, he lived in his parents’ Maryland basement and analyzed commercial real estate four days a week; he trained before work and played over long weekends. He later started a camp and clinic business, using a small endorsement from Under Armour. He was becoming something rare: a full-time lacrosse player.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rabil dived into social media before most athletes realized its potential, using Facebook’s athlete and business pages to connect to a rabid fan base. A successful YouTube channel followed, and he soon had more than 700,000 followers across all platforms. Major sponsors signed him, and Rabil soon became the first in his sport to earn more than $1 million annually.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He also pursued other business dealings with his brother Mike, who played football at Dartmouth. They formed an investment company in 2013 that was eventually bought out by the British lender Funding Circle, sending Mike to Silicon Valley while Paul stayed in New York as a star of the M.L.L.’s Lizards.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Rabils revisited lacrosse as a potential project, as the sport tailed off professionally even as it boomed at the amateur levels.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There were these other non-big-four sports at the time that were leveraging new technology and new media and getting behind their athletes, and those games were exploding,” Paul Rabil said. “So we began to ask ourselves the question: Why not lacrosse? Why not us?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The brothers explored ownership with the M.L.L., but the negotiations broke off. So they decided if they were going to chase their vision, they needed to start anew.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Their new league’s first priority was to let players devote themselves to lacrosse full time. The P.L.L. would provide full-time wages, health insurance and equity in the league, none of which were offered by the M.L.L. Rabil wanted players to do their own branding, just as he had for himself. The P.L.L. would give players access to their photo and video highlights, ready to be uploaded to their social media profiles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Rabils secured a multiyear deal with NBC Sports for live broadcasts of every game through one of its platforms, with the media company paying for production. The Rabils want to attract new fans to lacrosse in a way that has worked for mixed martial arts, with a documentary series to teach viewers about the sport.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Like golf and tennis, the P.L.L. has a touring model designed to spread the sport’s exposure as widely as possible, with six teams hitting 12 cities over summer weekends, with the league playing a total of three games each weekend. The festivities include instructional clinics, player interaction, contests and other offerings. The events evoke the energy of lacrosse’s marquee event: the N.C.A.A. tournament’s semifinals weekend, which attracts up to 90,000 fans every year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The P.L.L. drew about 11,000 fans a weekend in June, its first month, peaking with about 16,000 on the weekend in Baltimore, a lacrosse hotbed. About 400,000 fans viewed a Sunday game at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J., over three NBC platforms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Our fans care deeply about the sport and the stars,” Paul Rabil said. “They support world-class lacrosse and will follow their favorite players and teams, no matter if the game is home, away, or at a neutral site.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s this last piece of the equation that draws skepticism. Brendan Kelly, owner of the M.L.L.’s Chesapeake Bayhawks, has his doubts about the tour.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Team sports require community support,” Kelly said. “And I don’t know how you build a community around a tour.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The M.L.L. has been left to fight for its survival. It has bought back its media rights, raised player salaries and folded three franchises, leaving both leagues with six teams. Kelly said he believes his league will survive and could one day merge with the P.L.L. Rabil said he believes his will offer a better experience for both fans and players.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you can distill pro sports down into must-haves, you need to recruit and invest in the best players in the world, a major network distribution deal and a first-class fan experience,” Rabil said. “Pro lacrosse has never been positioned to capitalize on all three of these, until now. We’re a sports league and a media company.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Matthew Cacciato, a former sports media distribution executive with ESPN, Fox Sports and YES Network, said the P.L.L.’s goals for growth are reasonable given its working capital, social media presence and modest TV audience.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I am also aware of at least two P.L.L. franchise owners waiting in the wings,” said Cacciato, director of Ohio University’s master’s program in sports administration.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The P.L.L. will cap its season on Sept. 21 in suburban Philadelphia, when it will crown a champion and declare a most valuable player with an award named for Jim Brown, a Hall of Fame football and lacrosse player who was an all-American at Syracuse in lacrosse.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Perhaps, by then, the future of the pro sport will come into focus.</p>',\n",

       " 'puerto-rico-rossello-governor-protests': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">SAN JUAN, P.R. — Flags in hand, Puerto Ricans descended into the streets of San Juan on Wednesday, arriving by the thousands for several hours before the start of an enormous protest. They filled a boulevard lined with palm trees, a sea of people covering every inch from the imposing Capitol to the waterfront with a unified message: The governor must go.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On a platform with speakers, the rapper Residente offered a microphone to the artist Ricky Martin. The trap musician Bad Bunny waved a flag. The singer iLe looked over the impressive crowd and declared, “It was about damn time to wake up.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then, the schoolteachers and the union leaders, the lifetime political activists and the first-timers, the students and their parents, set off on foot to try to reach the governor’s mansion, where more protesters awaited. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/puerto-rico-protests-rossello-governor.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">For the fifth consecutive day</a>, they demanded Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló’s resignation. As on Monday, the night ended with chaotic confrontations with the police.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This time, there were many more protesters packed into the narrow colonial streets of Old San Juan, including a hardcore group that faced off with the authorities for hours. Police officers in riot gear <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/PatriciaMazzei/status/1151726875586310146\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">deployed tear gas and rubber bullets</a>. The young demonstrators left a Puerto Rican flag — symbolically painted in black, white and gray instead of red, white and blue — perched on the ground facing the governor’s mansion.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ostensibly, the demonstrators were protesting the arrogant and crass exchanges by the governor and his inner circle in a leaked group chat and the corruption of top politicians unveiled by a series of high-profile arrests. But the forceful display on the streets of Old San Juan amounted to a rejection of decades of scandals and mismanagement involving affluent and disconnected leaders who have time and again benefited at the expense of suffering Puerto Ricans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The outcry has brought the United States commonwealth to a crossroads, with far-reaching implications. For now, Mr. Rosselló <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/puerto-rico-protests-ricardo-rossello.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> is still governor</a>. But the persistent question about how Puerto Rico might be governed amid so many difficulties remains.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some of Mr. Rosselló’s ambitious goals, including the push for statehood, will almost certainly be shelved now. And his rapidly diminishing power has handed political fuel to President Trump, who has derided the island’s leaders as not competent enough to manage federal disaster relief funds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, Mr. Trump claims to be vindicated — even though some of Puerto Rico’s woes are not entirely of the island’s own making. Big Wall Street investors benefited for years from the Puerto Rican government’s willingness to keep taking on more debt. The island’s bankruptcy restructuring has cost jobs and, at one point, threatened public employees’ pensions and traditional Christmas bonuses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Silvia Álvarez Curbelo, a historian who retired last year from the University of Puerto Rico, said the protests against the governor are unprecedented. Nobody took to the streets during the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017, when both the local and federal governments were widely blamed for a botched response, because they were too busy surviving, she said. But the accumulation of grievances has led to a spontaneous explosion of discontent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This has been a process of trauma,” Ms. Álvarez Curbelo said. “And so now, all of that trauma has come out, all of that pain.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Rosselló’s tenure has been defined by the hurricane that hit less than nine months after his inauguration. Many people did not have electricity for months, and the storm is estimated to have left several thousand people dead — a grim reality that the governor’s administration was slow to acknowledge. On the chat, one of his aides made a joke about the cadavers that had accumulated after the hurricane in the understaffed morgue.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Immediately after the storm, Mr. Rosselló’s administration caused outrage when it awarded a $300 million contract, to help restore power, to Whitefish Energy, a Montana company with no major disaster experience. After the public furor, the governor was forced to cancel the agreement. Mr. Rosselló and the electric company’s leaders were criticized for not having standard mutual aid agreements ready, so that outside utilities could be on hand to help quickly. In the end, it took nearly a year to get power fully restored.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Rosselló has also overseen thousands of layoffs, cuts to public services, school closures and tuition hikes as a result of a 12-year economic recession and Puerto Rico’s debt crisis. Not all of those measures were Mr. Rosselló’s doing: The island’s finances are managed by an unpopular and unelected oversight board created by Congress.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Rosselló has tried at times to push back against “la junta,” as the board is known, but his term has coincided with its oversight, and Puerto Ricans have fused their anger toward Mr. Rosselló with their anger toward the board. One of the most popular protest chants is, “¡Ricky, renuncia, y llévate a la junta!” — Ricky, resign, and take the board with you.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since Puerto Rico’s Center for Investigative Journalism <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://periodismoinvestigativo.com/2019/07/las-889-paginas-de-telegram-entre-rossello-nevares-y-sus-allegados/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">published 889 pages</a> of the leaked Telegram chat on Saturday, Mr. Rosselló has found himself increasingly isolated in office. The snowballing scandal has, suddenly and unexpectedly, united factions from across Puerto Rican society, revealing deep dissatisfaction with how the island is governed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The governor’s moral authority and credibility to lead are completely gone,” said former Gov. Luis Fortuño, who like Mr. Rosselló is a member of the New Progressive Party. “I only hope and pray that the governor will think of the Puerto Rican people first, and put them above his own political interests.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Rosselló and the 11 other men on the chat have been ordered to turn over their cellphones to Puerto Rico’s Department of Justice. The governor has maintained that there was no illegal activity taking place in the chat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/puerto-rico-rossello.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">political crisis</a> has prompted Republican and Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill to consider imposing more oversight restrictions on $12 billion in federal Medicaid funds for the island. Tens of millions more have been set aside to help Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To avoid the unrest, cruise ships have skipped docking in San Juan, worrying small business owners who depend on tourists to survive. On Wednesday, Old San Juan felt eerily silent, its storefronts covered by storm shutters in advance of the angry crowds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Business leaders have expressed concern about scaring off investors long term, especially if truckers make good on their threat to join the protest by slowing deliveries of gasoline and goods.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Puerto Ricans of all stripes said they could no longer tolerate mocking, profanity and corruption, real or perceived, by the leaders who are supposed to be fighting on their behalf in Washington and San Juan. Six people with ties to the government, including a former Cabinet secretary and agency director, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/us/puerto-rico-corruption.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">were arrested</a> in the federal corruption investigation last week.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At Wednesday night’s protests, some said it was the devastation of the hurricane, and the government’s poor response, that helped open people’s eyes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is the upside of Maria,” said Coralie Córdoba, 55. “This would not have happened, I don’t think, if we wouldn’t have had Maria. It’s been too many years of putting up and holding back.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Vanessa Ruiz, a 34-year-old teacher, said she was attending her first protest ever. Puerto Rico has had troubled governments “for as long as I remember, since I was a little girl,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I have never seen or heard of a transparent government,” she said. “I haven’t lived under a government that hasn’t been corrupt. This is why we came.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Puerto Rico has a long history of embarrassing scandals. Mr. Rossello’s father, Pedro J. Rosselló, who was governor from 1993 through 2000, saw some of his closest aides, including an executive assistant and the former education secretary of education, convicted of kickback schemes. The stain on the two-time governor’s legacy added to his defeat when he tried to return to the governor’s seat in 2004.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He lost to Aníbal Acevedo Vilá, who was later indicted in connection with an elaborate scheme to pay back campaign debt. A judge dismissed many of the charges, and a jury acquitted him of the rest. In 2015, a federal indictment laid out a pattern of cronyism surrounding former Gov. Alejandro García Padilla, whose brother was accused of accepting gifts from a top Popular Party fund-raiser.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Acevedo said this week that members of his family joined this week’s protests. His daughter was tear gassed when police clashed with demonstrators. “I had never seen anything like this,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Talk of impeachment and private negotiations over a transition abound. Members of the governor’s New Progressive Party have spent much of the week on the phone, trying to figure out what comes next.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There is deep dissatisfaction, and there is grading of positions: Some people want him to resign the party presidency, some people want him to resign re-election aspirations and some are asking that he resign the position he currently holds,” said Kenneth McClintock, a former Puerto Rican secretary of state and senator.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mayor Mayita Meléndez of Ponce, who is a member of Mr. Rosselló’s party, left a meeting with the governor disgusted over his attempts to move on from the scandal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I expected to see a sensible man, a repentant man,” she said. She has since called on him to resign.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When he began campaigning, Mr. Rosselló, who holds a doctorate in biomedical engineering from the University of Michigan but had no prior political experience, was viewed as an extension of his father. This week, his father called legislators on the island to plead his son’s case to stay in office.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Carlos Romero Barceló, who served as governor from 1977 to 1985 and was one of the founders of the governor’s party 50 years ago, said he supported Mr. Rosselló’s candidacy but was surprised that once the governor took office, the governor’s chief of staff never returned any of Mr. Romero Barceló’s phone calls.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What has happened is the product of the arrogance and lack of experience,” Mr. Romero Barceló said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, Mr. Romero Barceló said it was “premature” to ask for the governor’s resignation. Party leaders were busy trying to find a good candidate to be secretary of state, so that someone could be in place for a smooth transition should Mr. Rosselló resign. The governor technically has the right to fill that position, but he needs the support of the head of the Puerto Rico Senate and House of Representatives to get a person approved.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With his political life hanging in the balance, Mr. Rosselló turned earlier this week to the most mundane of government agencies to try to defend the work being done by his administration: The Department of Motor Vehicles, he touted, would soon provide more services online.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Around the same time, on the other side of San Juan, several women walked into the local D.M.V. office and marched up to the framed portrait of the governor, with his boyish, matinee-idol good looks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an age-old act of defiance against power, they unceremoniously yanked Mr. Rosselló’s picture off the wall.</p>',\n",

       " 'pumpsie-green-died': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On July 21, 1959, Pumpsie Green made his major league debut as an eighth-inning pinch-runner with the Boston Red Sox, then played at shortstop to finish the game against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Green’s appearance was merely a blip in the box score, but his presence in a Red Sox uniform represented a climactic moment in baseball history.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Green, who died on Wednesday at 85 at a hospital in San Leandro, Calif., was the first black player for the Red Sox, the last of the 16 major league franchises of the time to have remained all white. His family confirmed the death in a statement, adding that he had been ill for five months.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In April 1945, the Red Sox, under pressure from a Boston city councilman, gave a brief tryout at Fenway Park to Jackie Robinson and two fellow Negro league players. None of them heard from the Red Sox again.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Robinson broke the modern major league color barrier in April 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Green was 13, living in the San Francisco Bay Area and hoping that someday he might play baseball with a Pacific Coast League team of the high minors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the time Green was called up by the Red Sox, Jackie and Frank Robinson, Larry Doby, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Ernie Banks, Roberto Clemente, Roy Campanella and Monte Irvin — the vanguard of baseball’s black stars — were forging Hall of Fame careers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the Red Sox, owned by Tom Yawkey, had maintained that they could not find a single black player to help them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Playing mostly at second base and shortstop, Green had an ordinary major league career so far as statistics went. In his four seasons with the Red Sox, he was a regular only in 1960, and he finished his major league career with the Mets in 1963.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m no martyr, no flag-carrier,” he told The Boston Herald when he was completing spring training with the Red Sox in 1959. “I’m not even interested in being the first Negro to make the Red Sox.” He said he just wanted a chance to play for Boston and, so far as pioneering went, “all the rest of it can wait.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Green himself had some waiting to do. The Red Sox sent him back to their Minneapolis farm team just before the 1959 season began, saying he wasn’t quite ready for the majors, though he had showed promise as a hitter in camp.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Boston chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., accusing the Red Sox of racial discrimination, expressed outrage at the failure to promote Green, and the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, a state agency, began an inquiry. It ended when Red Sox officials promised to “make every effort” to field black players.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Green finally got his chance on that July night in Chicago, and pitcher Earl Wilson become the second black player with the Red Sox a few days later.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Green played in his first game at Fenway Park, on Aug. 4, 1959, against the Kansas City Athletics, starting at second base, he received an ovation, and he hit a triple in his first at-bat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was almost on a cloud or in a trance or something,” he told the New England Sports Network long afterward. “I couldn’t breathe. I was so hyped up.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Green received a congratulatory phone call from Jackie Robinson. The Boston Celtics’ Bill Russell and K.C. Jones, whom Green knew from their playing days at the University of San Francisco, befriended him. Green found Ted Williams to be especially welcoming.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Elijah Jerry Green Jr. — nicknamed Pumpsie by his mother, Gladys, as a child though he was never sure why — was born on Oct. 27, 1933, in Boley, Okla. At the outset of World War II, his family moved to Richmond, Calif., in the Bay Area, and his father and mother found jobs in defense work.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He played shortstop at Contra Costa College in San Pablo, Calif. and joined the Red Sox’ farm chain in 1956.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Green was a man apart at spring training with the Red Sox in Scottsdale, Ariz., in 1959. The team’s hotel barred black guests, so the Red Sox found lodging for him at a hotel in nearby Phoenix, and he was driven to and from workouts by a team employee.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After his four years with the Red Sox, Green played in 17 games for the Mets in 1963. Appearing in 344 games, he <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/greenpu01.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">had a career batting average of .246</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He later coached and taught in the Berkeley, Calif., high school system.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Green lived in El Cerrito, Calif. His survivors include his wife, Marie; a daughter, Keisha Green; three brothers: Cornell, a former Pro Bowl defensive back with the Dallas Cowboys; Credell, and Eddie Joe; two granddaughters; and four great-grandchildren.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Green returned to Fenway Park in April 2009 for a part of baseball’s annual ceremonies to commemorate Jackie Robinson’s breaking of the color barrier. Fifty years after he made his Red Sox debut, he heard the cheers once more, this time when he threw out the ceremonial first pitch, to David Ortiz.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Reflecting on the America of the 1950s, Green expressed no lingering bitterness toward the Red Sox for their long reluctance to have a black player.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“When I was with the Red Sox, what was fair?” he told The New York Times in 1988. “I didn’t have to leave California and go to Boston to be discriminated against.”</p>',\n",

       " 'reimann-jab-nazi-keurig-krispy-kreme': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Emilie Landecker was 19 when she went to work for Benckiser, a German company that made industrial cleaning products and also took pride in cleansing its staff of non-Aryan elements.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was 1941. Ms. Landecker was half Jewish and terrified of deportation. Her new boss, Albert Reimann Jr., was an early disciple of Adolf Hitler and described himself as an “unconditional follower” of Nazi race theory.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Somehow, inexplicably, they fell in love.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The story of Ms. Landecker, whose Jewish father was murdered by the Nazis, and Mr. Reimann, whose fervent Nazism and abuse of forced laborers did not stop his family from attaining colossal wealth after the war, is a tale of death and devotion and human contradictions. It is also a tale of modern-day corporate atonement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Decades after World War II, Benckiser evolved into one of the largest consumer goods conglomerates on the planet. Known today as JAB Holding Company and still controlled by the Reimann family, it is worth more than $20 billion and owns Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet’s Coffee, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Pret A Manger, Keurig and other breakfast brands.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The relationship between Mr. Reimann and Ms. Landecker was for many years a secret. He was married, but had no children with his wife. He and Ms. Landecker had three, and he adopted them in the 1960s; today, two of them own a combined stake in JAB of about 45 percent. For decades, they say, they did not know about their father’s Nazism and the abuses that took place at the company they inherited: The female forced laborers who had to stand at attention outside their barracks naked. A prisoner of war who was kicked out of a bomb shelter and died.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Reimann and Ms. Landecker, who died in 1984 and 2017, respectively, never spoke about those years. Incriminating documents were destroyed or locked away in a safe. A two-volume company history glossed over the Nazi era in a handful of pages. But as Benckiser grew, morphing into the globe-spanning JAB, its past became impossible to ignore. Peter Harf, who joined the company in 1981 and became chairman this year, and whose own father was a Nazi, said he never really bought the idea that the organization had nothing to hide.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I knew the stories they told,” he said. “It didn’t smell right.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Around 2012, as JAB was acquiring high-profile coffee brands and drawing global attention, Mr. Harf pressed the family to open its archives to an independent scholar. By 2016, Paul Erker, an economic historian at the University of Munich, took on the task.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Only now, 74 years after World War II, are the family and the company grappling with their dark and complicated history. In March, the first findings about the abuse of forced laborers at the company leaked in a German tabloid. Discovering Nazi activity in corporate history is a somewhat regular occurrence in the country, and the crimes of the Reimanns were not as severe as, for example, those of the many larger companies with ties to death camps and the expropriation of Jewish businesses. But JAB’s portfolio of sunny coffee-and-doughnut brands in the United States made the revelations a global news story.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Its employees — there are 180,000 around the world — have reported that customers accuse them of “working for Nazis.” There have been boycott threats; this month, The Boston Globe published a scathing <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2019/06/04/peet-coffee-wake-call/XrJtIiY5MPYCycCGxglaSK/story.html?s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Afacebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR3DPrjcDynolmg7LB3gMZnD4yjMPdpfBT-YL4YVNjwElOT0J4ZMEK3S_kc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">article</a> with the headline: “I found out Nazi money is behind my favorite coffee. Should I keep drinking it?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The outrage has flared without the public knowing the full extent of Mr. Reimann’s Nazi convictions — and without knowing the final wrenching twist: that the history of the Reimann family is one of both victim and perpetrator. The heirs carry both sides within them. In a series of interviews with The New York Times, members of the Reimann family spoke publicly for the first time about the Nazi scandal. They disclosed the story of Emilie Landecker’s Jewish father, Alfred, and described how his murder has forced the clan to reckon not just with the past, but with the future.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Reimanns say they will spend some of their private fortune to honor Alfred Landecker’s memory. A one-time donation of 10 million euros (about $11.3 million) will go to institutions that help former forced laborers and their families. The Reimanns are also renaming their family foundation after him and doubling its budget to an annual €25 million, while ceding control of the board to an independent council. The foundation will fund projects that “honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and of Nazi terror,” and there are plans to fund at least one university chair in Germany in Mr. Landecker’s name.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.alfredlandecker.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">A new website for the Alfred Landecker Foundation</a> says its mission is to educate “about the Holocaust and the terrible price that is paid when intolerance and bigotry reign.” It continues, “The intention is to help strengthen our capacity to recognize the beginnings of such hatred and resist a repeat of such appalling events.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an interview, Mr. Harf noted that he lived in three places — New York, London and Milan — where nationalism and ethnic division were on the rise. For most of his long career, he said, he considered shareholder capitalism to be value neutral. No longer. In the age of Trump, Brexit and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/world/europe/italy-do-gooders-buonisti-matteo-salvini.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Matteo Salvini</a>, he said, businesses can no longer pretend that they are operating in a “value-free space.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is once again a time when everybody needs to take a stance,” Mr. Harf said. “I’m very scared of what’s happening.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In July 1937, Albert Reimann Jr. wrote a letter to Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS, who would later oversee the Holocaust.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are a purely Aryan family business that is over 100 years old,” wrote Mr. Reimann, then 39 and a senior executive in his father’s company. “The owners are unconditional followers of the race theory.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Reimanns had embraced National Socialism and anti-Semitism long before the Nazis came to power, according to an interim report by Mr. Erker, the historian. The younger Reimann heard Hitler speak in Munich in 1923 and became an early supporter. His father, Albert Reimann Sr., then the chief executive of Benckiser, heard him four years later in Mannheim, near the company’s southern German headquarters, and joined the Nazi party in 1931. His son followed a year later.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Around this time, the men gave the company a makeover in keeping with Nazi principles. By the time Hitler took over, Benckiser already housed a Nationalist Socialist Company Organization — a worker council that sought to uphold Nazi ideology. It later became a “model NS plant.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Reimann Sr. and Reimann Jr. were not just opportunistic followers of the regime,” Mr. Harf said. “They were fully signed up to the Nazi project.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Benckiser was then a medium-size industrial chemicals company, making products such as citric acids, a chemical to soften water, supplements for infant food and phosphates used in sausage making. In 1933, it employed 181 people. As an important supplier to the food industry, Benckiser benefited from the Nazi system, more than tripling sales over the next decade. Mr. Reimann Sr. served as president of the regional Chamber of Industry and Commerce, which helped orchestrate the Aryanization, expropriation and expulsion of Jewish businesses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Benckiser itself did not profit from businesses that had been taken from Jewish owners, and it never used concentration camp labor, as was common in bigger companies like Messerschmitt, a predecessor of Airbus, or IG Farben, which later split into companies including BASF and Bayer. But starting in late 1940, the Reimanns routinely took advantage of forced labor: men and women taken from their homes in Nazi-occupied territories, as well as prisoners of war, who were allocated by the Nazis to farms and industrial companies across Germany.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was around this time that Emilie Landecker started working in the accounting department as a clerk. Little is known about her time at the company during the war years, except that Mr. Reimann Jr. was now her boss. According to Mr. Harf, Benckiser’s use of forced laborers grew so fast that she would surely have been aware of the abuses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By 1943, 175 people, or a third of the total work force, were forced laborers, most of them from France and Eastern Europe. Benckiser operated two labor camps, one of them overseen by a brutal foreman, Paul Werneburg, who had been with the company since 1910. On his watch, female workers were forced to stand at attention naked outside their barracks, and those who refused risked sexual abuse. Workers were kicked and beaten, among them a Ukrainian woman who also cleaned in the Reimanns’ private villa.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During a bomb raid on Jan. 7, 1945, Werneburg threw dozens of workers out of a camp bomb shelter. Thirty were injured, and one died. As word of Werneburg’s brutality spread, even the local Nazi office in charge of allocating forced laborers reprimanded the Reimanns for mistreating their workers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Landecker would have witnessed it all, said her son, Wolfgang Reimann, in an email. “She lived through the horror show happening in our own company,” he said. “She probably sat in the very bunker when Werneburg threw out the workers.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Reimanns’ enthusiasm for Nazi ideology never waned, Mr. Erker’s research shows. As late as February 1945, Mr. Reimann Jr. believed in the “Endsieg,” Hitler’s “final victory.” The war ended that May; a month later, he was arrested and interned by the Allied occupying powers as part of the de-Nazification process. Held in the A block in Camp 73 under prisoner number 2228, Mr. Reimann Jr. wrote a letter to the commanding officer on Sept. 22, dismissing allegations that he had been an “early and enthusiastic Nazi” as mere “denunciations” — and insisting that he was in fact a victim of the Nazis.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I may conclude that under the circumstances I am at a loss to understand the origin of the above mentioned allegation,” he wrote. “I am rather inclined to believe that I was myself closely surveyed by the Gestapo.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It worked. While the French initially barred Mr. Reimann Jr. from continuing his business activities, American officials overturned the judgment, classifying him as a “follower” of Nazism, rather than an active Nazi himself.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 1947, the wealth of the Reimann family totaled 686,000 Reichsmark, or approximately $2.4 million in today’s money. Over the decades, the fortune grew in step with Benckiser and its successor companies, and today the family’s worth is estimated at €33 billion. On one recent list of the wealthiest families in Germany, the Reimanns ranked second.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wolfgang Reimann said that the only thing his father ever told his children about the war was that the forced laborers had loved the company so much, they cried when the conflict ended and they had to leave.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He claimed that the French workers often got some red wine on Saturdays,” Wolfgang said, “and that transferees from other camps said that Benckiser was the best camp they had ever been in or heard of.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That’s nonsense, he said, cursing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Landecker was at work at Benckiser when the Gestapo came for her father.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was April 24, 1942. Around noon, two police officers arrived at the family apartment. Her younger brother, Wilhelm, who would later recollect the incident in an unpublished family memoir, opened the door.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Is the Jew Alfred Israel Landecker here?” one of the officers asked.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wilhelm led them to his father, who had been waiting. A letter had arrived that month, informing him of the date of his deportation. With Germanic precision, it had instructed him to pack one suit, some underwear and a coat with a yellow Star of David sewn to the front. No money or valuables were allowed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“So, you dirty Jew,” the officer said. “Are you ready to take a trip?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Alfred Landecker closed his suitcase and put on his coat. Then he hugged and kissed his son for the last time. “Willi, stay home so that no one associates my Star of David with you,” Mr. Landecker said, and then asked him to say goodbye to his sisters. “Give my love to Emmi and Gerdele. Behave, and obey God.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A few weeks later, one last letter arrived from Mr. Landecker, but only the envelope has survived. It shows that he was interned in block III 416/2 in Izbica, a ghetto serving as a transfer point for the deportation of Jews to the Belzec and Sobibor death camps in Nazi-occupied Poland.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Landecker, a World War I veteran and successful accountant, had been a loving father. After his wife, a Catholic, died in 1928, he looked after their three children by himself. Emilie, the eldest, was 6 at the time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Nazis took over in 1933. Two years later, the Nuremberg laws, which institutionalized the Nazis’ race theories, stripped Jews of their citizenship rights. Around that time, Mr. Landecker did two things that would prove prescient. He made sure his children were baptized Catholic, like his late wife. And he officially transferred to them his main possessions, including the family apartment, so that they could not be expropriated.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Mr. Landecker could not protect his family from an atmosphere that rapidly escalated from hostile to life-threatening — a shift he chronicled in a series of letters to his younger daughter, who was unwell and staying with his wife’s sister in the Bavarian countryside at the time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My dear child,” he wrote in December 1938, a month after Kristallnacht had seen synagogues and Jewish homes across Germany vandalized and burned. “The times have changed and with them the people.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We fought for five years only to have an age like this,” he wrote, referring to World War I. “I hope you, my dear children, remain well-behaved and good, and keep loving me, even if you suffer because of me.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Landecker was searching for a way to flee Germany — perhaps for the United States, where he had a brother and sister-in-law. “Aunt Pauline has written from America,” he wrote that December. “She is trying for us, maybe things will work out.” But there wasn’t enough money. Mr. Landecker was not allowed to work, which meant that Emilie, still a teenager, became the family’s only earner.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Mr. Landecker received his deportation notice in April 1942, the family made one last desperate attempt to stop it. They took a train to Berlin to the office in charge of Jewish affairs, where Mr. Landecker’s children showed officers their Catholic certificates. They were chased away.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Crying, we went back to the hotel, where our father was waiting,” Wilhelm Landecker wrote later. Despite the disappointment, their father got theater tickets for everyone that night in Berlin. A few days later, he wrote his last letter to Bavaria.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My dear Gerdele,” he wrote. “As you can see, I’m still here, but not for long. Today I learned that my departure is on the 24th of the month — in two days. So this is the last letter that you receive from me from here or perhaps ever. We don’t know what is waiting for us.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I wish you all the best for the future, stay healthy and become decent human beings,” he urged her. “If possible, I will write as soon as possible and hope that you won’t entirely forget me.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You won’t be able to marry here in Germany,” he continued. “Learn languages!! You have your future ahead of you — don’t waste it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“With this, my dear child, obey God, and please send my good wishes to everyone and be greeted by your Papa.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After her father was deported, Ms. Landecker continued working at Benckiser, becoming a trusted employee. When the war ended, Ms. Landecker would periodically bring Mr. Reimann Jr. papers to review in Heidelberg — making a perilous journey through bombed-out landscapes and an emergency bridge over the Rhine.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">No one knows when exactly their love affair started. But in 1951, their first child was born. Two more followed. Twice a week, every Sunday and Wednesday, Mr. Reimann Jr. would leave his wife and visit Ms. Landecker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She worked for Benckiser until 1965. That year, Mr. Reimann Jr. formally adopted their children. (His wife, Paula, had known of their relationship for some time.) The German authorities had long pressed Ms. Landecker for the name of her children’s father, and she had refused to give it away. But years later, she admitted in a letter to Mr. Reimann Jr. that she always missed not being his wife — and not having a regular family.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“And now I would like to also say something about our relationship,” Ms. Landecker wrote. “I think I need you much more than you need me, because I take up only a relatively small part of your life.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I am despite everything a woman,” she wrote. “You were and are the only person, to whom I can talk.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Today I know of course that it wasn’t a lack of willingness on your part, but I missed it nevertheless and I did not want to make demands that cannot be fulfilled under the given circumstances.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Landecker was a quiet woman. She did not speak much. But her children say that despite everything, she loved their father. “I never understood why,” said Wolfgang Reimann. “He was not very lovable from my perspective.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For decades, the children knew that their parents had met “at the company.” They knew that their maternal grandfather, Alfred, had been murdered by the Nazis. But until this year, they did not know that their father had been a fervent Nazi. When the children asked about the family’s Jewish roots, Wolfgang said, Ms. Landecker would speak evasively of growing up in a “Jewish milieu,” and then admonish her children to stop talking about “that old stuff.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My mother never said anything,” Wolfgang Reimann said. “For the longest time, I believed it was her personality.” But he has changed his mind. “If I had to live with the love of my life, as my mother did, and this person was also responsible for the terrible things that happened during the war, I would not have spoken much, either, I guess,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nearly every German company that has been around long enough has a story about the Nazi era. Many have been told. But many have not. Bahlsen, the cookie maker, commissioned a study on its war years only last month, after a young heiress flippantly played down the company’s use of forced labor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">International expansion has often been a trigger for German companies to reckon with their pasts. That was the case with the Reimanns’ properties. Over the years, Benckiser went through mergers and spinoffs; it combined with another firm to become the consumer-product giant Reckitt Benckiser, known for such brands as Lysol and Durex condoms, and eventually, the Reimanns channeled much of their wealth into <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.jabholco.com/#section-about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">JAB</a>. In recent years the holding company has spent billions to become a rival to the likes of Starbucks and Nestlé by buying chains including Panera Bread, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/business/krispy-kreme-bought-by-jab-holding-a-german-conglomerate.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Krispy Kreme</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/business/dealbook/pret-a-manger-jab-nestle.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Pret A Manger</a>. Last year, it also helped Keurig Green Mountain <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/business/dealbook/keurig-dr-pepper-snapple.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">buy Dr Pepper Snapple</a> for nearly $19 billion. JAB also controls the cosmetics giant Coty, the owner of Calvin Klein fragrances.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As scrutiny of the company grew, Mr. Harf urged the Reimann family to take the initiative and research its history — before someone else got there first.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Nazi revelations have stirred the youngest Reimanns. “When I heard and read of the atrocities committed at Benckiser, sanctioned by my grandfather, I felt like throwing up,” said Martin Reimann, 30, who is a grandchild to Ms. Landecker and Mr. Reimann Jr. “I cannot claim that I was very interested in politics before. I was just living my life. But after what happened, I changed my mind. I have to do something. In our family council, the younger generation created a little bit of a rebellion.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By renaming its foundation after Alfred Landecker, the Reimann family is bringing back one name from the millions killed by the Nazis. But it is also explicitly linking the memory of crimes past to today’s fight to preserve the values of liberal democracy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What we can learn from history and how we can learn from history is at the core of this foundation,” said Norbert Frei, the chairman of its academic advisory council. A respected German historian at Jena University, he has led investigations into the Nazi pasts of other companies, including Bertelsmann.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is not just about researching and remembering the past,” he added. “It’s about stabilizing and maintaining democracy today.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Harf, JAB’s chairman, agrees. He said he had recently read “The Order of the Day,” a historic novella by Éric Vuillard set in the years before World War II. One scene takes place in February 1933, when Hitler and the president of the Reichstag encourage 24 German industrialists to donate to the Nazi party. The businessmen — representing companies that are still prominent German corporate names, like Siemens, Bayer and Allianz — duly open their wallets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Harf said it made him think that not enough voices in business were speaking up against the re-emergence of nationalism and populism in Europe and the United States. Every time business leaders make decisions, he said, they should ask, “What does this mean for our children? What does it mean for the future?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In history, businesses have enabled populists,” he added. “We mustn’t make the same mistake today.” Then he quoted the Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal: “For evil to flourish, it only requires good men to do nothing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added, “As the successors and descendants of people who committed horrendous acts, it is vital that our generation accepts what has happened, that we do whatever we can to bring tolerance and equality to the communities in which we live, and to ensure that the actions of Albert Reimann Sr. and Albert Reimann Jr. are a part of history which is never repeated.”</p>',\n",

       " 'rory-mcilroy-british-open': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They say you can’t win a major on the first day, but you can lose it. Among those who may have lost the British Open at the Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland quickly this year was a pretournament favorite, Rory McIlroy, who fired a quadruple-bogey on the first hole Thursday and finished the round at eight over par. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McIlroy was perhaps the most watched golfer in the days leading up to the event, both for being one of the best in the world, but also because he is from Northern Ireland and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/sports/golf/rory-mcilroy-british-open-royal-portrush.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">grew up playing at Portrush</a>. He broke the course record there at age 16. There would be no course record from him on Thursday. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McIlroy’s first tee shot at his home Open went out of bounds, striking a fan and cracking the screen of her cellphone. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His next tee shot hit the deep rough, and he found tangled, unplayable greenside rough on his approach shot, leading him to take a drop. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Once he found the green in six, he did manage to get it in the hole in two putts. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I hit my first shot out of bounds yesterday, but it went right, so that might have been in my head a little bit,” he <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/golf/47640604\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">said on the BBC</a>. “I turned the ball over a little too much. It was a poor tee shot, but not that bad it deserved to go out of bounds.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McIlroy had more trouble on the 16th, missing a six-footer for par and then a one-footer for bogey. The golf instructor David Leadbetter called it a “real junior golfer type of mental mistake” <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/golf/47640604\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">on the BBC</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For good measure, McIlroy triple-bogeyed the 18th, and finished the day with a 79, his hopes for a title squashed. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There were no tournament-winning expectations on David Duval, the 2001 British Open champion. That Open was the last of his 13 wins on Tour. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But he started this year’s Open with two birdies, so he may well have looked forward to a good day on the course. It didn’t turn out that way. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Duval’s woes started with a quadruple-bogey on the fifth, throwing away his early gains. Incredibly, that wasn’t his worst hole of the day. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On No. 7, Duval shot an octuple-bogey 13. The score came in part because he hit the wrong ball. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The seventh hole is a 590-yard giant, one of two new holes added to the course for this event. Duval’s tee shot on the hole was feared lost, so he hit a provisional, and then another. Then once he actually got going on the hole, he mistakenly played the wrong provisional ball. That is a two-shot penalty. He then had to start the hole over, and that didn’t go a lot better.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The octuple bogey on the par-5 hole was initially feared to be worse, as the scoreboard operator, perhaps overwhelmed by the big number, initially posted a decuple-bogey 15.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Duval’s 13 is the third highest score in the British Open’s storied history, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://golfweek.com/2019/07/18/british-open-david-duval-makes-13-first-round/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Golf Week reported</a>. Worse still was a 15 by Herman Tissie in 1950 and a 14 by a certain “D. Murdoch” in 1925. Duval also had a triple-bogey on 17 and finished the day with a 90, 19 over par.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Despite not making a cut on the PGA Tour since 2015, Duval, 47, who now plays a handful of tournaments a year, qualified for the Open as a former champion. That exemption will remain in place until he is 60. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Phil Mickelson also struggled, shooting a five-over 76.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Not every hole was terrible for every golfer Thursday. Emiliano Grillo of Argentina aced the 13th hole, the first hole in one at the British Open since 2016.</p>',\n",

       " 'rory-mcilroy-british-open-royal-portrush': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rory McIlroy was just 16 years old when he broke the course record at Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland, home to the British Open this year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He shot a 61. It was that round at the 2005 North of Ireland Championship — highlighted by nine birdies and one eagle — that ignited his career. It was the announcement to the golf world that he had arrived.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was unbelievable and surreal how someone managed to shoot such a low score — he was only 16,” Gary McNeill, the Royal Portrush club pro who was there that day, said in an interview.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Everyone was shocked,” he said. “It was a special day, and a signal that this kid was something. Lots of kids have something, but rarely amount to much. He was impressive in the way he was able to maintain that concentration and focus. He was fearless. That’s one of the things that all the great players have.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Stephen Crowe was McIlroy’s partner that day.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It started off steady enough,” he said. “I was thinking it was going to be a solid round, but nothing special. Then from nowhere he went from 2 under to 6 under.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“At that stage, word was getting out. He always had a crowd around him, but that day the crowd got bigger as he got more birdies.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McIlroy also knew he had done something special.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was still lying in my bed last night thinking about it,” he told reporters the next day. “To shoot 61 anywhere is unbelievable, but to shoot it round Royal Portrush is even better.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Fourteen years later, McIlroy still remembers that day. “There are not many golf runs that I remember every shot, but that day I do,” he said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theopen.com/latest/2019/05/rory-mcilroy-61-at-royal-portrush\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">in a recent interview released by the tournament</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He remembers missing a putt at the first hole for a birdie. Driving a 6-iron onto the green at the second, where he two-putted for a birdie; and the birdie he made on the par-3 sixth hole. He remembers his wedge shot on the par-5 ninth and the eagle on 10. With a birdie on the 11th, he was 6 under. “At that point I realized I was doing something special,” he said. Five birdies followed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the 17th hole, there was a wait as players gathered at the tee. McIlroy stepped away to take some practice swings.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think I had probably caught myself thinking about it a little too much,” he said. “I wanted to go clear my head a bit and start afresh with a new golf shot.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McIlroy returned to the tee and hit a perfect drive, followed by a long iron to the front right side of the green and a two-putt for birdie. He closed out the round with a final birdie and carded a 61, breaking the previous course record of 64 set by Randal Evans in 2002.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That confidence I had and the cockiness at 16,” he said. “Sometimes, I need to rediscover that.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Royal Portrush has two links courses: the Dunluce Links and Valley Links. The Open, which starts on Thursday, will be played on Dunluce, on a par-72, 7,317-yard track designed by Harry Colt.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[Read more on how the </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/sports/golf/british-open-royal-portrush.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">British Open finally returned to Royal Portrush</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> after almost 70 years.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Royal Portrush previously hosted the British Open in 1951. The club also held the Irish Open in 2012, where McIlroy tied at 10 with 11 under. It has changed slightly since his course record, with the golf architect Martin Ebert updating it to meet championship standards.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McIlroy played the front nine last Saturday, including the new seventh and eighth holes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He just played them all alone,” said McNeill, the club pro. “He was really excited. He was buzzing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">McIlroy called the new eighth hole, a par 4 at 430 yards, “a huge improvement.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There are two bunkers to contend with. “You have two options,” he said. “You can take the bunkers out of play short or you can take the bunkers out of play long. Most guys lay back.” McIlroy played long.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He recognized the pressure to perform for hometown crowds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In my lifetime, I never thought I’d get to play an Open championship at home in Northern Ireland,” he said recently. “It’s going to be massive. That week has been earmarked for a long time. It’s going to be one of those weeks where I have to enjoy the opportunity of getting to play in front of my hometown, not trying too hard, not putting myself under a lot of pressure. Just to go out and enjoy it, because it might be the only time I get to do it.”</p>',\n",

       " 'saudi-arms-vote': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">WASHINGTON — The House gave final passage on Wednesday to a series of measures that would block the sale of billions of dollars of arms to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sending to President Trump a fresh rebuke of his administration’s efforts to circumvent Congress to help Persian Gulf allies prosecute a disastrous war in Yemen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A scattering of Republicans and the House’s lone independent, Justin Amash of Michigan, joined Democrats in three back-to-back votes, submitting for the record their stewing anger at Mr. Trump’s resolute support of Saudi Arabia and his use of emergency powers to sidestep Congress, this time with a declaration of an emergency over Iran.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If the administration wants to sell these weapons, they should follow the law — not misuse it — and come to Congress,” said Representative Eliot L. Engel, the New York Democrat who is the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Iran emergency, he continued, was “phony” and devised “to trample on this body’s constitutional duties.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is the second time in recent months that Congress has passed bipartisan legislation condemning the administration’s relationship with Saudi Arabia. Lawmakers in both parties have been incensed that the president has done nothing to punish the kingdom for the grisly killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident and Virginia-based Washington Post columnist, even after the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In April, lawmakers <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/politics/yemen-war-end-vote.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">voted to end</a> American military involvement in Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen by invoking the rarely used War Powers Act of 1973, only to see <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/us/politics/trump-veto-yemen.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Mr. Trump veto the resolution</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">No other foreign policy issue has created as large a rift between the president and Congress, and the vote to block the arms sales deepens the divide. But the outrage on Capitol Hill has limits, particularly in the president’s own party. The measures approved on Wednesday, and already passed by the Senate, are likely to meet the same fate as the resolution to end military support to the war in Yemen: death by veto. Republicans are unlikely to provide enough votes to override what would be Mr. Trump’s third veto of his presidency.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The White House <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-arms-sales.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">announced the munitions sales</a> in May, invoking an emergency provision in the Arms Export Control Act to allow American companies to sell $8.1 billion worth of munitions in 22 pending transfers. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/31/magazine/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">waging an air war in Yemen</a> that has come under sharp criticism from Congress and human rights organizations. A State Department official, R. Clarke Cooper, testified before the Senate last week that the munitions had yet to be delivered, nearly 50 days after the emergency had been declared.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Members of Congress from both parties had been holding up arms sales from American companies to Persian Gulf nations and trying to end United States military support for the Saudi-led coalition that is fighting the Houthi rebels in Yemen, which has resulted in what the United Nations calls the world’s worst man-made humanitarian disaster. But by declaring an emergency over Iran, a move that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed hard for, the administration was able to blow through lawmakers’ holds and the 30-day review period Congress normally receives to examine a sale.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, urged his colleagues to vote down the resolutions even though he <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/arms-sales-saudi-arabia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">had previously described</a> the use of emergency authority “unfortunate” and argued that not all 22 sales necessitated emergency certifications.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The decision to move forward with these arms sales is part of a larger effort to deter Iran,” Mr. McCaul said. “A key part of that effort is to empower greater burden sharing by enhancing the defense capabilities of our allies. These sales provide more options for deterring Iran that do not all depend on U.S. intervention.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lawmakers have never successfully blocked an arms sale, but presidents historically have worked with Congress to make concessions after legislators voice opposition. Administrations have also seldom used the emergency provision in the Arms Export Control Act.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When President Ronald Reagan notified Congress in 1984 of the administration’s intent to sell Saudi Arabia the stinger missile system, citing Iraqi attacks on Iranian oil facilities and Iranian attacks on Kuwaiti and Saudi ships, the legislative opposition was so swift that Mr. Reagan withdrew the sales from consideration. Two years later, when his administration announced its intent to make the sale a second time, Congress moved to block it, spurring a veto.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With the threat of Mr. Trump’s vetoes looming large — and apparently little appetite to override them — some lawmakers have been casting about for an alternative the president might accept.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This month, Senator Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican and Trump loyalist who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/S%202066.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">introduced legislation</a> that would seek to reset the United States’ relationship with Saudi Arabia. It would also punish members of the royal family, denying visas to those in the Saudi government up to the minister level until the administration can certify that the country has made progress on broad human rights issues.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That legislation is expected to be considered by the committee next week. But underscoring how divided lawmakers are on how to respond, Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is one of the president’s closest congressional allies, and Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the panel, will most likely push to amend the legislation to match their harsher legislation that would place sanctions on the crown prince and suspend arms sales to the country.</p>',\n",

The Times visited two major ports, interviewed inspectors and Coast Guard officials, and spoke with maritime safety experts. This is what we found:</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Officials have worked hard to improve maritime safety, adopting new regulations and tougher penalties for people who violate them.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">But rule breaking appears widespread, with the government making limited headway against an industry in which safety is <!-- -->still often an afterthought<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Crucial new measures to prevent ships from being overloaded are often sidestepped. The Coast Guard has uncovered cheating at almost every step of the cargo-weighing process.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">The government itself has <!-- -->declined <!-- -->to require changes at ports that experts say would dramatically increase safety by making it easier to catch cargo cheaters. Officials rejected the fixes as too costly.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">One maritime safety expert put it bluntly: “They haven’t learned the lessons of the Sewol disaster after all the sadness and national trauma.”</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">The Problem</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Sewol <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/world/asia/in-ferry-deaths-a-south-korean-tycoons-downfall.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">sank because</a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/27/world/asia/in-ferry-deaths-a-south-korean-tycoons-downfall.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> of greed</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Renovations by the owner, and approved by regulators, made the ferry more profitable, but also dangerous. Extra berths made the ship so top-heavy that dockworkers said it would lurch badly when loading or unloading. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On the day the ferry sank, April 16, 2014, shippers <!-- -->had loaded twice the legal limit<!-- --> of cargo on its <!-- -->deck<!-- -->s. Not only did the ship’s crew lie about the total weight of its cargo, <!-- -->crew members failed to properly secure<!-- --> the cars, trucks and shipping containers to the decks.

Had inspectors taken the time to board the vessel, it would have been hard to miss how grossly overburdened it was.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The cheating at every level created a perfect storm. When the Sewol made a sharp turn while fighting a strong current, the badly balanced ferry began to keel over. The poorly secured cargo started sliding across the <!-- -->dec<!-- -->ks, forcing the ferry further onto its side.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The ship soon capsized. More than 300 people were killed. Only 172 passengers made it off alive.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The disaster enraged, and traumatized, the nation. The country’s leaders vowed to write new laws and rules to improve safety at sea, and to do battle with the culture of corruption that courses through the country’s companies and safety agencies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I will make sure that all this sacrifice was not for nothing by removing the layer after layer of corruption that has accumulated over the years, and by making South Korea a safe country,” vowed the president at the time, Park Geun-hye.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The government lived up to its promises to pass new laws and rules that cover everything from how thorough inspections need to be, to the maximum age of ferries, to the training of crews to better deal with emergencies on the high seas. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The penalties for lawbreakers have been stiffened, and prosecutors have cracked down hard when violators are caught.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What has proved much harder to fix is the pursuit of profit at all cost and an often casual disregard for safety — problems that have long been blamed in South Korea not only for shipping disasters but also for building collapses and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/world/asia/south-korea-fire-moon-jae-in.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">hospital fires</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Maritime investigators continue to find pervasive wrongdoing, especially by the employees of cargo-handling companies and by truck drivers who lie about the weight of their <!-- -->cargo<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have made a lot of changes and improvement since the Sewol incident,” said Park Han-seon, who coordinates research on maritime safety at the Korea Maritime Institute. “But what the country still needs is a safety culture where business managers put safety before profit.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And while the government has taken aim at business practices, victims’ families have accused it of failing to set its sights on officials’ own culpability in the ferry disaster. The families are angry that senior government officials did not end up in jail, especially for the botched rescue effort.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/21/world/asia/chaos-ruled-sinking-ferry.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Coast Guard was both late</a> to the scene and woefully unprepared to help when it finally got there. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In April, the families<!-- --> called on the authorities to investigate former top officials, accusing them of failing to order an evacuation of the passengers in the early hours of the disaster and over accusations that they conspired to impede investigations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We know who killed our children, but we are not able to punish them,” said Jang Hoon, who lost his 17-year-old son.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Jang believes the country will become safer only if top officials realize they can be held criminally accountable for their actions.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If the Sewol had not been so grossly overloaded, experts say <!-- -->it most likely<!-- --> would have made it to its destination, Jeju Island, off the southern coast.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As part of the flurry of new regulations, truckers are now required to have their cargo weighed at government-licensed stations. The problem is that some shippers and truck drivers have already found ways to evade this safeguard.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Jeju Island, officials have found cheating at almost every step in the cargo-weighing process. Last year, the Coast Guard covertly watched trucks going into Jeju Harbor for two weeks. It found 21 drivers who it said illegally added more cargo near the harbor without returning to a weigh station in order to save time and money. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the truckers were not the only ones flouting the law. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Coast Guard also found that officials at two government-licensed weighing stations had issued certificates to at least four drivers without even weighing their trucks. And in 2017, Coast Guard investigators found that a cargo-handling company official had fabricated more than 1,400 weight certificates.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Despite the alarming findings, Coast Guard officials said there was no ongoing investigation into weight cheating on Jeju Island ferries. The agency, they said, does not have enough investigators. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries told The Times it was fighting the cheating by conducting random checks on trucks going onto ships in major ports. Last year, <!-- -->the ministry reported<!-- -->, the spot checks of 117 randomly selected trucks using mobile measuring equipment found no cheaters. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the limited scale of such checks, along with the Coast Guard’s troubling findings on Jeju, raise disturbing questions on how widespread, and dangerous, cargo weight-cheating might be.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Im Nam-kyun, a professor at Mokpo National Maritime University in South Korea, said that a few truckers lying about their cargo might not make a vessel overloaded, but that cheating was risky.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What if many trucks cheat on their cargo at the same time and the extra cargo is loaded on an upper deck?” Mr. Im said. “What if the ship is hit suddenly with high waves and its cargo happens to slide? Problems that won’t normally cause trouble can combine to make a ship capsize in an extraordinary situation.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The ample evidence<!-- --> of cargo cheating found in even limited investigations “is proof that South Korea remains insensitive to safety,” he added, calling on the Coast Guard and inspectors to carry out random spot checks more often. “What they are doing right now amounts to little more than window-dressing.”</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the wake of the Sewol disaster, it became clear that South Korea faced two major problems with inspectors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One was a glaring conflict of interest: Inspectors were paid by the Korea Shipping Association, a lobbying group. Inspectors reported feeling pressured to turn a blind eye to safety problems or risk being reassigned to distant ports.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In addition, the rules governing inspections were so lax that many inspectors simply eyeballed ships from shore to see if they were overloaded, a practice that left them vulnerable to being fooled. That’s what happened with the Sewol: Most of its ballast water — which would have helped balance the ship — had been drained so that it wouldn’t appear to sit too low in the water to inspectors on shore.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Inspectors now work for a company overseen by the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries and are required to board ferries to check their seaworthiness. During recent visits to Jeju and Incheon, a port west of Seoul, The Times witnessed inspectors doing just that, sometimes when they did not know they were being observed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Before the Sewol incident, we were not required by law to visit the ship for inspection,” said Jeong Han-gu, who supervises inspectors at that port in Incheon. “Even if we wanted to, we often didn’t have the manpower or the time to do it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The government has also increased the number of inspectors to 142 from 73, and inspectors say they feel much freer to cite shippers for <!-- -->safety<!-- --> violations. In 2015, the Oceans Ministry added another layer of safety by dispatching maritime supervisors to ports to oversee the on-site inspectors. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But on the critical issue of cargo cheating, even an army of honest inspectors would be hamstrung by the fact that they do not have equipment to independently weigh trucks right before loading.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the months after the Sewol’s sinking, safety experts advised installing that equipment at the docks. But the government dismissed the recommendation because of the cost, lack of space and the fear of slowing down loading.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And despite the improvements that have been made, corruption still appears to be leading to deaths on South Korean ships.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Three years after the Sewol sank, a South Korean-owned cargo ship, the Stellar Daisy, <!-- -->went<!-- --> down after reporting flooding in a cargo compartment. Only two of its 24 sailors were saved. Prosecutors recently indicted six officials of the ship operator, saying they ignored severe corrosion to save their company money. They also indicted an official with the government-licensed inspection company that <!-- -->performed a structural check, saying he did not adequately inspect the ship. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What company did the inspection? The same one that gave the <!-- -->risky renovations on the<!-- --> Sewol passing grades<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">The Takeaway</strong>: Changing laws is a lot easier than changing culture.</p>',\n",

But I hadn’t consistently tracked my sleep habits and patterns before. Would it really make a difference, I wondered, to have this data? Would it help me to sleep better?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I decided to test it out. I wore an <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/technology/personaltech/apple-watch-series-4-review-health.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Apple Watch</a>, since it is one of the most popular health-tracking devices. I also downloaded a top-rated app called <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://autosleep.tantsissa.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">AutoSleep</a>, which uses the Apple Watch’s sensors to follow my movements and determine when I fell asleep and woke up. (The Apple Watch lacks a built-in sleep tracker.) <!-- -->Here’s what AutoSleep gathered on my sleep habits. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the excitement ended there. Ultimately, the technology did not help me sleep more. It didn’t reveal anything that I didn’t already know, which is that I average about five and a half hours of slumber a night. And the data did not help me answer what I should do about my particular sleep problems. In fact, I’ve felt grumpier since I started these tests.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That mirrored the conclusions of a recent study from Rush University Medical College and Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. Researchers there noticed patients complaining about sleep data collected by apps and devices from Nike, Apple, Fitbit and others.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In their study, the researchers warned that sleep-tracking tech could provide inaccurate data and worsen insomnia by making people obsessed with achieving perfect slumber, a condition they called <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/health/sleep-tracker-insomnia-orthosomnia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">orthosomnia</a>. It was one of the latest pieces of research supporting the idea that health apps <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/health-apps-provide-pictures-if-not-proof-of-health/\" title=\"\">don’t necessarily make people healthier</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For some practical tips on how to get more shut-eye, I sought out Raphael Vallat, a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Human Sleep Science at the University of California, Berkeley. His most important advice: Do not check your sleep data on a regular basis.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you look at your data, it can modify the perception of your sleep,” he said. “You may think: ‘Oh, gosh, I didn’t sleep well. Should I be tired? Am I in a bad mood?’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here’s what I learned after two weeks of sleep tracking. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To understand sleep-tracking data, I delved into how sleep works. There are three main stages: Light sleep, deep sleep and <!-- -->REM<!-- --> sleep (for rapid eye movement).</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The deep sleep stage is beneficial for physical restoration, like muscle reparation and metabolism recovery, researchers said. REM sleep, the stage in which we dream, helps in repairing our psychological and emotional networks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On average, a person completes a sleep cycle, which includes each of the three main stages, every 90 minutes. To get a good night’s sleep, you need to complete four or five cycles. That’s partly because the cycles are not the same throughout the night: The early cycles have more deep sleep, whereas the later ones have more REM sleep.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But our sleep-tracking tech? It generally can’t accurately measure REM sleep.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In sleep-tracking labs, the gold-standard scientific equipment typically includes sensors that are connected to someone’s face and neck to measure eye and brain activity, among other variables. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But sleep-tracking apps for wearable devices like the Apple Watch or Fitbit primarily look at movement and heart rate to determine when you are asleep or awake — which are generally not precise enough to measure the different sleep stages, Dr. Vallat said. Without a good look at REM sleep, those apps may give an incomplete picture of sleep quality. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here is where the AutoSleep app gets credit: It estimates sleep duration and deep sleep using the motion and heart rate sensors, but it does not attempt to guess REM sleep. David Walsh, the computer scientist who developed AutoSleep, said he knew the movement and heart rate sensors would not accurately estimate the REM stage, so he didn’t bother.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another unknown for sleep trackers are the algorithms that are being used to measure people’s sleep, Dr. Vallat said. In contrast, the algorithms used by university sleep labs have been publicly shared for decades. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some scientists said consumer-grade sleep trackers should not be dismissed as inaccurate. Michael Grandner, director of the University of Arizona’s sleep research program, who has consulted for Fitbit, said that wrist-worn sleep trackers had a long history of use in scientific research and that some devices could be very accurate at measuring sleep stages. He added that the devices enabled some sleep tracking to be done in the real world, not a lab.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">O.K., but what happens once you collect your sleep data from a tracker or an app? There is no real answer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">My sleep-tracking statistics said I needed more sleep. (Duh.) Buried deep inside the data was some general information about sleep, but the app stopped short of offering advice on how to solve my personal sleep problems.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Ethan Weiss, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, has been wearing a ring on his finger called Oura Ring, which includes a sleep tracker, for nearly a year. The ring measures motion and heart rate to present granular data about the different sleep stages. He said that while the device most likely had a rough sense of when he was sleeping and awake, he didn’t know whether the information about sleep stages was accurate — let alone what to do with it. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There’s no program — it’s just information,” Dr. Weiss said. “The question is can you do anything on your own to optimize it? Or is the information just worthless or is it making things worse? Sometimes being aware of it just makes you even more anxious.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Vallat shared similar concerns. One big problem, he said, is that many of these tracking apps send daily notifications with users’ sleep statistics. He suggested that people experimenting with sleep trackers look at weekly trends, not daily summaries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a vicious cycle, because if you immediately feel you didn’t sleep enough, it will impact your mood,” he said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Grandner of the University of Arizona said that consumer-grade sleep tracking was in its early stages and that it was too soon to tell what people should do with the data.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“For a person to be worrying about their sleep stages is like being worried about the gas makeup of the air you’re breathing in,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Makers of sleep tech and scientists can agree on one thing: Sleep-tracking apps and devices can be useful for getting a broad look at your sleep, but people should resist drawing conclusions about their sleep health. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Walsh, the developer of AutoSleep, said people should use his app to look at trends, not to obsess over the daily data.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’ve had plenty of customers say this has changed their life, but I get other people saying they’re waking up in the middle of the night and checking their sleep,” he said. “I tell them to go back to sleep.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Fitbit said in a statement that it took accuracy very seriously and that its team continuously <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://investor.fitbit.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/Study-Shows-Fitbit-Heart-Rate-Tracking-Devices-Accurately-Track-Light-REM-and-Deep-Sleep-Stages/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">studied</a> and tested the accuracy of its products. Apple did not immediately have a comment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Vallat told me that if I really wanted to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/how-to-sleep?module=inline\" title=\"\">get better sleep</a>, I should simply try to sleep and wake up at the same time every day — that would help my brain learn how to build a structure for optimal sleep. He also advised making the bedroom a cool environment (about 68 degrees) and as dark as possible; avoiding alcohol in the evening; not checking email or social media right before bed; and asking myself each morning when I woke up, “Do I feel refreshed?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That all sounded reasonable — and there’s no app needed for any of that.</p>',\n",

The show was entitled “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/fashion/astral-fashion-buzz-aldrin-space.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Mission to Mars</a>,” and it featured Buzz Aldrin, the lunar module pilot on the Apollo 11 mission, as its closing model. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">that</em> was just over a year before Heron Preston teamed up with NASA to create a line of streetwear splashed with the space agency’s logo, which was itself around the time Virgil Abloh closed his first<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/fashion/louis-vuitton-virgil-abloh-paris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> Louis Vuitton</a> men’s wear collection with a model in a silver space poncho.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I always say, space is the new black,” said Mr. Graham, who on Tuesday sponsored the annual Kennedy Space Center gala, a blowout in honor of the moon landing that included a Swarovski-crystal-covered mini-rocket ship award for the best dressed in space-inspired clothing. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In honor of the event Mr. Graham also made a limited-edition NASA bomber jacket in silver or black satin with a lining featuring the Saturn 5 rocket.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Just over half a century ago, the space age caught the imagination of the fashion world and changed how we all dress, ushering in an era of liquid mercury frocks and go-go boots; of synthetic fabrics and plastic fantastic technological innovation. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The influence of the intergalactic has waxed and waned over the years, but when it comes to wardrobes, the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing — not to mention President Trump’s plans for a new <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-space-force.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Space Force</a>; the imminent release of “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” the finale of the space saga; the news that NASA plans to open the International Space Center to tourists next year; and the Elon Musk-Jeff Bezos-Richard Branson race to privatize exploration of the cosmos — is bound to set off trends once again. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This time, however, is not quite like the last time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Space travel is glamorous, it’s modern, and it’s exclusive,” said Mia Fineman, <!-- -->a curator<!-- --> in the department of photography of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the exhibition curator of “Apollo’s Muse: The Moon in the Age of Photography” — all words with great appeal to designers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Julien Dossena, the creative director of Paco Rabanne, said: “It carries values of excitement and belief in human kind and progress. And that never really goes out of fashion.” It does, however, change.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Originally, after all, the space set — André Courrèges, Pierre Cardin and Paco Rabanne (whose penchant for unnatural materials like plastic and metal, and the links therein, inspired Jane Fonda’s futuristic sex bomb costumes in “Barbarella”) — were united by a sense of optimism and belief in the new frontier, as represented by their clothing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“For French designers especially, the space age became a metaphor for youth and progress,” said Valerie Steele, the director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">White and silver, shine, movement, geometric shapes (especially if they mimicked flying saucers and planetoids), the Milky Way, interstellar imagery: These were the building blocks of a generational new look.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“When you look back at that time, it was almost magical for people,” Mr. Dossena said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But what happens when you look forward?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As our own attitudes toward space exploration have evolved — have stretched toward Mars; toward the galaxy as a necessary escape, rather than pioneer jaunt; toward the idea of mining other planets in an effort to repair the damage done this one — so, too, have the designs of those whose job it is to interpret what the promise of space means today. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After all, to simply look back is to engage in an exercise in kitsch nostalgia, the exact opposite of what the original space age designers were doing. There’s a reason the new motto of Courrèges is “the future is behind you.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And a reason <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/fashion/courreges-paris-fashion-week.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Yolanda Zobel</a>, the artistic director of the brand, has made it her mission to replace the house’s signature vinyl, which once upon a time represented a breakthrough, with natural materials.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The question of the future is the central question,” Ms. Zobel said. “You still think about a new world, but today that means something different. It’s maybe how we do the same thing, but without plastic this time.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">According to Lucie Greene, <!-- -->a trend forecaster<!-- -->, advances in material science as much as any silhouette, is actually what represents fashion’s new frontier, with designers orbiting around the ideas of growing leather from mushrooms, extruding fabric from a 3-D printer, and regulating body temperature — in a time of climate change — through sensors in fabric.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Now we see the evolution of mankind in a more careful way because we realize what it has meant for the planet,” Mr. Dossena said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Indeed, there is a notably dystopian tinge to the recent wave of space fashion, a somewhat unnerving reflection of where, exactly, all that futurism took us.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The emphasis now is on apocalyptic clothing, and protective garments,” Ms. Greene said, pointing to the proliferation of Mylar blankets, jumpsuits, cover-ups, balaclavas and armor in stores. It’s what to wear when the comet shower comes or you have to survive in an atmosphere not necessarily hospitable to humanity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The implication being: “We messed up planet Earth, so we have to go explore other planets,” Ms. Fineman said. This time, we’re on the dark side of the moon.</p>',\n",

       " 'stanford-boathouse-enters-spotlight-for-all-the-wrong-reasons': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">REDWOOD CITY, Calif. — A Stanford sailor arrived at the university’s gleaming boathouse to clean out her locker at the end of the school year. The doors would not open.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Did they change the locks again?” she said with an air of exasperation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was a reasonable question. In March, when the sailing coach John Vandemoer was fired after being snared in a nationwide admissions scandal, the locks were changed at the Arrillaga Family Rowing and Sailing Center. In April, they were changed again, after the men’s rowing coach Craig Amerkhanian was mysteriously fired — late in the season, weeks before his planned retirement. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Stanford’s boating troubles stem from the work of William Singer, the private college consultant who collected millions of dollars in payments from wealthy parents and paid college coaches and athletic administrators to designate non-athletes as recruits for admissions purposes at elite universities. In some cases, the college coaches pocketed the money. In others, Singer, who goes by Rick, made donations to the athletic programs. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Stanford is investigating the scope of the wrongdoing. It has hired the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett to <!-- -->review how its athletes are recruited and how athletics-related gifts are accepted.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The university has reviewed email accounts, phone records and computers of coaches and athletic department staff. It has acknowledged that Singer contacted other coaches at Stanford — Amerkhanian among them. At least one parent indicted in the scandal, a Canadian businessman, also contacted Amerkhanian to discuss a recruiting spot for his son. Stanford maintains it has not unearthed any other cases of admissions fraud, however.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Stanford is strengthening its internal controls and processes in an effort to prevent something like this from happening again,” E.J. Miranda, a university spokesman, said in a statement. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That<!-- --> Stanford is in this position is startling. It has a $26.5 billion endowment and prides itself on achieving athletic excellence without sacrificing integrity<!-- -->. But the turmoil in these two modestly financed athletic programs, along with another pair of dismissals, has resulted in what has long been seen as the ultimate sin at Stanford — sullying the university’s reputation. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You didn’t do anything that could tarnish Stanford’s name,” Jay Kehoe, a former head sailing coach, said. “That was definitely the culture.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Vandemoer, wearing a navy suit and holding his wife’s hand, walked into a Boston courthouse for a sentencing hearing last month, the lawyers on both sides sparred over the extent of the damage done to Stanford’s reputation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since the scheme was revealed in March, federal prosecutors have brought criminal charges against more than 50 people, including coaches, Hollywood actresses and prominent figures from the worlds of law and finance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Vandemoer, who pleaded to conspiracy to commit racketeering, was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/stanford-coach-college-admissions-scandal.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the first to be sentenced: six months of home confinement</a> for receiving more than $600,000 from Singer in exchange for designating applicants as sailing recruits. The best-known case involved <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/yusi-molly-zhao-china-stanford.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a student from China whose parents paid Singer $6.5 million.</a> </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Vandemoer, who put the money from Singer into a fund that supports Stanford’s sailing program, lost his job and his Stanford housing. He now lives at the vacation home of a Stanford benefactor and coaches privately, at a club run by his <!-- -->wife<!-- -->, just a few hundred yards from the Stanford boathouse. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Stanford is a place that I love,” Vandemoer told reporters last month in front of the courthouse<!-- -->. “I have brought a cloud over Stanford, and for that I’m deeply ashamed.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The sentencing capped a turbulent few months at Stanford. In March, a week before the admissions scandal broke, James Shirvell, an admissions officer, was fired after the police charged him with the attempted murder of his girlfriend while under the influence of LSD. Stanford’s president, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, and provost, Persis Drell, vowed <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://quadblog.stanford.edu/2019/03/21/an-update-on-the-admissions-fraud-scheme/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">to review the applications Shirvell judged “to assure his assessments were sound.”</a></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then, in April, Stanford abruptly fired two longtime coaches: <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.stanforddaily.com/2019/04/17/stanford-fires-award-winning-sports-performance-director/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Shannon Turley, who oversaw strength and conditioning for all varsity sports</a>, and<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Cal-investigating-former-crew-team-member-13698280.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> Amerkhanian, who had planned to retire in August, after his 19th season</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an interview, Turley, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/sports/ncaafootball/stanfords-distinct-training-regimen-redefines-strength.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">who had been praised for reducing injuries, especially among football players</a>, declined to comment on his firing. But he said that “for any errors of judgment that I may have made at Stanford, I can sleep well at night knowing that I did everything in the best interest of the student-athletes.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Stanford takes great pride in its athletics program, which <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://pac-12.com/article/2019/06/27/stanford-wins-25th-directors-cup-six-pac-12-members-among-top-25\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">for the 25th consecutive year won the N.C.A.A.’s Directors’ Cup</a>, the award for overall excellence<!-- -->. The university is also notoriously tight-lipped about personnel matters. Few people were aware of why any of the coaches was dismissed. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Stanford athletics is a really cold, calculating, bureaucratic organization,” said the Olympian Silas Stafford, a rower who graduated in 2008. Noting how Amerkhanian’s firing was publicly described as a retirement, Stafford said: “I would call it cowardice. If there’s really dirt, let it see the sunlight. If there’s not, let him go out in style.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Stanford was informed last week that multiple people had told The New York Times that Amerkhanian had been dismissed, it acknowledged he was given a choice — retire or be fired — for violating employee behavior policies. Stanford said the violations came to light this year, but refused to specify if they were spurred by the federal investigation or if they were gleaned from the scrubbing of computers and phones.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Amerkhanian, 62, declined to comment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Tall, lean and boisterous, <!-- -->Amerkhanian<!-- --> often used an air horn to get his rowers’ attention and leaned on Springsteen lyrics and historical references for inspiration, like commemorating the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s Selma to Montgomery march with a 54-mile row.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His firing, on April 18, stunned the Stanford rowing community, which had been planning to honor him at a retirement barbecue at the boathouse nine days later, to coincide with the annual Big Row against the University of California, Berkeley. Organizers scrambled to find another venue, but a<!-- -->ttendees<!-- --> described the event as awkward, with Amerkhanian complaining that he was a victim of Stanford’s post-scandal vigilance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For years, Amerkhanian and Vandemoer operated out of a contemporary boathouse <!-- -->on the edge of San Francisco Bay named for the developer <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.stanforddaily.com/2012/10/23/haus-mitt-theme-plays-on-arrillagas-philanthropy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">John Arrillaga Sr., </a>a former Stanford basketball player and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.stanforddaily.com/2012/10/23/haus-mitt-theme-plays-on-arrillagas-philanthropy/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">one of the university’s largest benefactors</a>. His children, John Jr. and Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, attended college and graduate school at Stanford. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Inside the two-story, 16,500-foot facility, sculls are stacked <!-- -->in four bays on the ground floor, while a fifth is set aside for sailing. Upstairs, along with million-dollar views of the Santa Cruz Mountains, the Bair Island Ecological Reserve and the bay, are rowing machines, stationary bikes and weights, along with a kitchen, laundry room and offices.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If sailing requires mental and physical dexterity, reading the wind and the opponent, and moving decisively on a small boat, then Vandemoer, 41, was a fitting avatar: short, serious, hardworking and quiet, with dark sunglasses and a Red Sox cap typically pulled tight over his brow out on the water.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Conversely, rowing requires long levers, brute strength and fierce determination to push through searing pain on the water. If experience is crucial in a sailboat, rowers can be made — and over the last 15 years, few have cranked out Olympians like <!-- -->Amerkhanian.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But some former rowers and Stanford coaches said Amerkhanian could also be territorial, abrasive and a bully. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Stanford suspended him for three months and stripped him of his title as director of rowing during the 2010-11 school year, after a joint Pac-10 and Stanford investigation found violations of school policies, conference rules and abuse of authority, according to what the then-athletic director Bob Bowlsby told rowers at the time. Bowlsby, now the commissioner of the Big 12 Conference, declined to comment other than to say the discipline wasn’t connected to admissions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He was always a square peg in a round hole in the bureaucracy of Stanford,” said Stafford, who credited Amerkhanian with molding him into an Olympian.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A problem Amerkhanian and Vandemoer had in common was the cost of competing against colleges in the Northeast. In the 2018-19 school year, the sailing team made 15 trips east of the Mississippi River.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">According to Department of Education data on operating expenses, Stanford spent $182,000 on its sailing program in 2017 — more than any school other than Boston College, and nearly double what Yale and Georgetown spent. But Vandemoer said in an interview before his sentencing that his budget did not include equipment; his biggest fund-raising need was to replace a fleet of 18 sailboats — at a cost of about $120,000 — every five to eight years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rowing teams don’t travel as frequently — or as far — but they have a major expense that the sailors do not. They must transport their boats, which can run up to $80,000 for a carbon fiber shell, to races. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Stanford spent about $386,000 on its rowing programs in 2017 — down from a peak of $557,000. Other top rowing programs like Yale and Cal each spent around $675,000 in 2017, and the University of Washington spent $1.25 million.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Though Stanford said its coaches do not have fund-raising benchmarks, the external pressures to finance these programs were touched on in letters supporting Vandemoer to the judge who sentenced him. <!-- -->A<!-- --> parent of two Stanford sailors noted that the team stayed at his house in Annapolis, Md., to save money.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In addition, <!-- -->Joseph<!-- --> W. McCoy, a Stanford alumnus and avid sailor, wrote: “I am not at all surprised with how such low-profile and poorly funded sports like sailing, soccer, rowing, etc., became such easy targets in this rather ingenious criminal operation that created this mess.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Singer, who was known among Silicon Valley’s rich and well-connected parents, sought coaches at Stanford and the University of Southern California to join his scheme. If he had more success at U.S.C., it was not for his lack of trying at Stanford, which acknowledged that Singer had contacted “several” coaches. Singer met Vandemoer in 2016, but several years before that he had asked Amerkhanian what he needed. The coach replied: Six-foot-five, 1,500 SAT and 4.0 G.P.A.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One parent who approached the coach was David Sidoo, a Vancouver businessman. He has pleaded not guilty to paying Singer at least $200,000 between 2011 and 2013 to hire a test administrator to take the SAT in place of each of his two sons and a Canadian high school graduation exam in place of his older son.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sidoo discussed the possibility that at least one son, Jordan, a coxswain in high school, be recruited to Stanford. Amerkhanian mentioned the student to admissions, according to people who have talked to the former coach.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jordan went to Cal, and was on the rowing roster for at least one season before graduating in 2018.

       " 'subway-franchisees': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Manoj Tripathi couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had a vendetta against his Subway sandwich shop. A franchisee for nearly two decades, he had done everything he could to keep his restaurant, in a strip mall in Northern California, in perfect condition. But lately it seemed like someone was out to get him.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was the middle of 2017, and inspectors sent by Subway’s regional manager were finding a new problem to cite each month: a handprint on the glass door, the wrong brand of bathroom soap, cucumber slices that were too thick, he said. They seemed to be little things, but with each write-up, Mr. Tripathi’s grip on his store weakened. If he racked up enough infractions, Subway could terminate his contract and take control of the business.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When an inspector named Rebecca Husler arrived one day that September, Mr. Tripathi thought his restaurant was pristine. Then he noticed that a single light fixture needed a new bulb. Mr. Tripathi rushed out to buy a replacement, but by the time he returned, Ms. Husler had marked it as a violation. A year later, just as he feared, he lost the Subway.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Tripathi wasn’t paranoid. Ms. Husler really was out to get him. She had specific instructions from her boss, the regional Subway supervisor, to find fault with the store, she said in an interview.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was kind of his hit man,” she said, sipping an iced tea at a Starbucks in the Bay Area. Ms. Husler worked for the regional supervisor for nearly a year, she said, and she has come to regret the role she played in pushing a group of store owners out of their investments. The light-bulb moment with Mr. Tripathi, especially, gave her pause. “We’re ruining these people,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway is the largest fast-food company in the world by store count, with more than 24,000 restaurants in the United States alone. It got that way thanks in large part to entrepreneurial immigrants. Unlike at chains such as McDonald’s and Burger King, where many franchises are operated by investment firms, Subway owners are mostly individuals and families. The company’s co-founder, Fred DeLuca, made stores easy to open; most new franchisees are charged a $15,000 initial fee, compared to $45,000 at McDonald’s. In exchange, Subway operators must hand over more revenue than at many other chains — 8 percent of gross sales — while also agreeing to other fees and stipulations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For half a century, the system worked to mutual advantage. Subway’s value hit $12.3 billion, and countless first-generation Americans bootstrapped their way to success, one foot-long at a time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the time <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/business/fred-deluca-co-founder-of-subway-sandwich-chain-dies-at-67.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Mr. DeLuca died in 2015</a>, though, the company was struggling. Rivals like Jimmy John’s and Quiznos had grown, and Subway’s spokesman, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/business/jared-fogle-former-subway-pitchman-gets-15-year-prison-term.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Jared Fogle</a>, pleaded guilty to child sex and pornography charges. Mr. DeLuca’s sister, Suzanne Greco, took over as chief executive, inheriting a company that many felt had grown too fast and haphazardly. In 2016, for the first time ever, more Subway stores closed than opened. But while many franchisees shut down because of underperformance, others operating profitable locations began to feel targeted, too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For many owners, Subway’s internal workings are a mystery. The chain, which is private, offers far less financial information than other global fast-food peers. In the most recent version of a disclosure document given to prospective franchisees, which is more than 600 pages long, the company notes that it can revise its rules “at any time during the term of your Franchise Agreement under any condition and to any extent.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The document would be difficult for anyone to process. But Alexander Dembski, who trained many new Subway owners over a 34-year career, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/03/16/239302/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">estimated to Fortune</a> in 1998 that 30 to 50 percent of the chain’s franchisees were immigrants, and that more than a third of applicants scored poorly on proficiency tests in math and English.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before his death, Mr. DeLuca was accused of using bullying tactics that left many operators struggling to recoup their investments, leading to lawsuits, regulatory run-ins, government investigations and constant complaints from franchisees. One of the most persistent areas of protest has involved a class of Subway managers known as development agents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway parcels its vast network of stores into more than 100 regional fiefs. Each is overseen by a development agent, who recruits new franchisees, approves buyers for existing stores and sends inspectors — known as field consultants — to conduct monthly reviews. But usually, development agents are also franchisees themselves. When that is the case, they are both in charge of and competing with other store operators, and their own locations are inspected by people they hire.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These feel like conflicts of interest to many Subway owners — giving development agents the means and motivation to shut down competing stores and take over profitable ones by manipulating inspections. Many franchisees who have lost their restaurants say that they have recouped little of their original investments. Intervention from Subway’s headquarters in Connecticut is rare.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Don Fertman, Subway’s chief development officer and a veteran of the company for 38 years, said that owning restaurants helps give development agents “a better understanding of all aspects of owning a small business.” He said the company reviews the agents’ work and expects them to uphold ethical standards, dealing with violations “on a case-by-case basis.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Across the country, franchisees have lodged complaints and filed lawsuits. In West Virginia, Bhrugesh and Utpala Vyas ran three stores, two of them top performers in the territory, they said. In a 2017 filing in federal court in Connecticut, Ms. Vyas accused the local development agent, the man’s son and an inspector of conspiring to take over the stores by concocting “unreasonably harsh evaluations.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A judge ruled against Ms. Vyas. Records from local health departments and Subway show that at least two of the stores are now co-owned by the inspector and the development agent. “I feel very bad, and my blood is boiling,” Mr. Vyas said in an interview. “This was our hard-earned money.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Fertman said that complaints like those Mr. Vyas filed are “unfounded,” and that Subway “makes every effort” to help noncompliant franchisees improve. He added that the company is “in the business of selling sandwiches — not closing restaurants, not marking people out of compliance.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Our business development agents are well-respected members of our business community,” he said. “And when we hear these allegations, I would say that they are false.” He said he was not aware of any exceptions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For years, the Subway system’s opacity and aggressive pace of development — Mr. DeLuca once dreamed of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-27/subway-s-deluca-sees-sandwich-chain-expanding-to-50-000-shops\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">opening 50,000 stores by 2017</a> — went hand in hand. The company encouraged stores to open within blocks of existing locations, with development agents often giving the established franchisees a choice: Operate the new restaurant themselves, or compete with someone recruited by Subway. Franchisees, feeling pressured, sometimes took the first option.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was assumed that the stores would, eventually, become sustainable,” Mr. Tripathi said. An immigrant from India, he bought into Subway’s expansion in a major way. After two decades spent at companies like Jamba Juice and the Body Shop, opening Subway franchises was his chance to take charge. At one point, he owned 38 stores, and by 2015 he was among the largest franchisees in California’s East Bay region.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That was when Ms. Greco took over Subway, and the company’s store count began to shrink. In the East Bay, Mr. Tripathi was under the jurisdiction of a development agent named Chirayu Patel, known as Akki. He oversaw a huge, choice territory that included most of Northern California and western Nevada. Mr. Patel also owned dozens of Subway stores.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2016, he convened a franchisee meeting in a Sacramento warehouse. He told everyone that Subway wanted to improve its strongest restaurants and shut down the weaker ones, according to Nikku Aulakh, a franchisee who was present.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She left the gathering alarmed. She and many fellow franchisees had been pushed for years to invest huge sums in new stores that were now struggling. Subway’s franchise contract forbids the company from unilaterally closing stores just because sales are weak. But franchisees can lose control of their restaurants for failing to meet Subway’s operating standards — violations cited by inspectors employed by development agents like Mr. Patel.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Aulakh said Mr. Patel eventually pressured her into closing or selling her four stores in Sacramento, after they received a slew of bad evaluations. “I would have liked to stay in business for another 10 to 15 years,” she said. “I wanted to make more money, but I had no other choice.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Vishal Sharma, a franchisee in Nevada who owned three stores, described another meeting that Mr. Patel convened in Reno the same year. In front of some 20 store operators, Mr. Patel said that he had “the money to buy the best lawyers,” Mr. Sharma recalled. “At the time, we weren’t scared. We thought that maybe that was just his style. Then we figure out that this guy’s template is not developing the territory, it’s taking away the territory.” (Mr. Patel said in an email that he had been informing the franchisees that Subway’s lawyers were available to answer legal questions.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At one point, a franchisee sent Mr. Patel an anonymous complaint; he responded with an email to a large group of them, which was reviewed by The Times. He threatened a lawsuit that “would be so huge it would nearly take all of your life earnings in Subway in fighting this suit. Please don’t test me especially when you don’t have any basis.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway terminated Mr. Sharma’s contracts in 2017. Last December, in state court, he accused Mr. Patel of using “rigged compliances” and Subway of employing an “unusual structure where the local agent is a supervisor, as well as a competitor.” The case was ordered into arbitration in Connecticut, but Mr. Sharma is appealing the decision.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Husler, the inspector who called herself Mr. Patel’s “hit man,” said that Mr. Patel considered his own interests when determining what stores would be sent to arbitration, and likely closed. When it came time to conduct inspections, she said, Mr. Patel made it “very clear that his stores were to pass” and that “the people he wanted out of the system were to fail out of the system.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Times reviewed text messages about individual franchisees in which Mr. Patel assigned evaluations to certain inspectors “so we can get this guy out of the system.” But when it came to his own stores, there was a different standard, according to Effie Lennox, a former inspector who worked for Mr. Patel in Northern California from 2007 to 2010. She said that he asked her not to report violations at his locations and to email him about them instead.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That was the problem: He was a franchisee and a development agent,” she said. “And especially with someone like him, having that conflict of interest is the worst-case scenario for the franchisee, because he’s in it for his own benefit, not for theirs.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Lennox said that she often went behind Mr. Patel’s back to warn franchisees that they were being targeted. “These are people’s livelihoods,” she said. “I felt like I needed to undo the damage that he was doing to these poor people.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an email to The Times, Mr. Patel said that he had acted appropriately at all times, and that his goal is for all of the stores in his territory to be successful. He said that evaluations at stores owned by Mr. Tripathi, Ms. Aulakh and Mr. Sharma were “conducted in a manner consistent with evaluations of other Subway restaurants.” There were problems with sales at Mr. Tripathi’s stores and food safety at Mr. Sharma’s locations, he said. Mr. Patel added that he and his team “have no intention of deliberately falsifying” evaluations and would never train inspectors to do so, and that noncompliant restaurant owners are given the chance to correct violations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dozens of franchisees in the region decided to appeal to Ms. Greco for help. Mr. Tripathi was one of them. “There is a deep sense of morass within the franchisee community,” the group wrote in a 2016 letter. Soon after, they wrote again, asking that Ms. Greco “designate somebody impartial to look into the matter.” The franchisees said that they suspected Subway’s development agents of commissioning “unfair/biased/questionable evaluations” and forcing franchisees out “at a throwaway price.” They feared retaliation. “Needless to say, time is of the essence,” they wrote.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Greco did not respond, they said. (Subway said it always has “open lines for franchisees through multiple channels of communication.”) But Mr. Patel heard about the letter and was enraged, Ms. Husler said. He wanted all of the franchisees involved ejected from his region, she said. Ms. Husler recalled Mr. Patel instructing her: “Go in there and just throw your probe right into that food. It’s not going to make temperature, and you can mark them out of compliance.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He actually gave us specifics on what he wanted us to do,” Ms. Husler added — such as directing her to visit during shifts with inexperienced employees who were more likely to make mistakes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Not all of the franchisees who have left the Subway system operated their stores perfectly, and many ran afoul of local health inspectors in addition to the company’s evaluators. But dozens of franchisees contend that issues that never bothered Subway during its rapid expansion suddenly put them out of business in recent years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those franchisees feel that they have little recourse. Near Sacramento, Minal Khatri and her husband owned a Subway in a prime location, just off the freeway. After Mr. Patel’s inspector repeatedly marked it out of compliance around 2014, she recalled, she and her husband started to fight constantly: Why were they failing? Why couldn’t he get everything into compliance? Ms. Khatri said they both repeatedly asked Subway headquarters for advice, but never got a response. Eventually, the company took her into arbitration, and she said she was told to find a buyer for her store or risk forcible closing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Patel rejected all of the candidates she found, she said; records indicate that he now owns her restaurant. Ms. Khatri and her husband divorced. It was only after it became clear that Mr. Patel wanted to buy her store, she said, that she realized her husband might not have been to blame for everything after all. Mr. Patel said the Khatris asked him to buy the restaurant.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another franchisee, Kanwardeep Virk, said that starting in 2006, he operated four stores in the Lake Tahoe area that were profitable and compliant with Subway’s standards — his “babies,” he called them. Suddenly, at the beginning of 2016, he said, he started failing evaluations. He said one inspector sabotaged a meatball storage bag, by puncturing it with a thermometer and then waiting to record its temperature.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway started arbitration proceedings against Mr. Virk. Such cases are typically heard near Subway’s headquarters in Connecticut. Many store owners cannot afford to travel to defend their stores in person, and argue their cases by phone or by filing documents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2018, Subway initiated the equivalent of 29 litigation actions (mostly arbitrations) per 1,000 franchisees, compared to 1.4 actions for McDonald’s, Dunkin’ Donuts, Pizza Hut, Burger King and Wendy’s combined, according to an analysis of the companies’ disclosure documents by John Gordon, a restaurant industry expert at Pacific Management Consulting Group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Eventually, Mr. Virk gave up. Mr. Patel now owns two of his former stores. In his emailed statement, Mr. Patel wrote that the restaurants had problems with food safety and labor practices and owed back rent, and that Mr. Virk himself arranged to close or transfer them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Federal Trade Commission requires Subway to produce an annual list of franchisees with permanently closed stores, which the company said “allows prospective franchise owners the opportunity to contact them to discuss their experience with Subway.” But many franchisees who received termination letters after being deemed noncompliant eventually sold their stores — sometimes under duress and often for far less than they believed the stores were worth, several franchisees said. Those locations are recorded as transfers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Franchisees say that this classification allows Subway and other franchisers to mislead potential store owners. But government oversight is limited. The F.T.C.’s compliance guide for franchisers has not been updated in more than a decade. Lois Greisman, the associate director of the Division of Marketing Practices, said that the agency had not focused on franchise misconduct or taken any franchise-related enforcement action in years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway is in the midst of an ambitious makeover campaign, hiring a firm that has worked with Tiffany &amp; Company and Saks Fifth Avenue, adding to its menu and stocking remodeled stores with new technology.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since Mr. DeLuca’s death, the company has been on shaky footing. It was slower than many rivals to launch a digital loyalty program and mobile ordering options. Revenue fell to $10.4 billion last year, down 9.5 percent from 2015, according to the market research firm Technomic. In recent months, the chain has added a new chief information officer, a chief marketing officer and a North American vice president. Ms. Greco retired last year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway’s store count has shrunk by more than 2,000 since 2015. “We have to look at each and every location and optimize our footprint accordingly,” said Mr. Fertman, Subway’s chief development officer. “We have to make sure, ultimately, that we have the right restaurants in the right locations.” Other executives have called it an “optimization” effort.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, wrote in a letter in May to the Small Business Administration that franchisees had accused Subway of “using minor infractions to steal the stores from owners through a rigged arbitration system,” citing reporting by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/05/05/subways-arbitration-for-minor-infractions-is-out-of-control-franchisees/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">The New York Post</a>. “I am troubled by increasing complaints from entrepreneurs about unfair practices that are causing them financial difficulties,” she wrote. The agency said in its reply that, out of 1,551 federally backed loans approved for Subway franchisees in the past decade, 12 percent were charged off, or deemed unlikely to be repaid — a far higher rate than the average franchise loan.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway, in an email, said that the franchisees who alleged misconduct were “anomalies,” and that its surveys and “listening tours” found that 80 percent of franchisees in the system want to keep working with the company.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On the day after Memorial Day, Mr. Tripathi and his wife, Sadhana, stopped by one of the 10 Subways they still own, in an outdoor shopping mall in Orinda, Calif. The cashier at the restaurant cracked jokes with customers. Fans spun overhead. Every light bulb shone.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Tripathis said they fear they could lose yet more of their stores. They sued Subway and Mr. Patel in 2016 in California court, accusing the development agent of “using a variety of techniques including trumped-up and false inspection reports to justify terminating certain franchises.” Subway invoked the clause in the franchisee contract that requires disputes to be resolved in private arbitration in Connecticut. The Tripathis have filed an appeal for the case to proceed in California.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Tripathi, a trained engineer with a business degree, and Ms. Tripathi, who holds a doctorate in chemistry, said they were mostly able to read and understand the reams of legal documents produced by the conflict. Many of their fellow franchisees cannot, they said. “The reason we were fighting them is that we can,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But he and his wife are getting tired of the Subway system. “We worked so hard, we gave up our own careers,” Ms. Tripathi said. “We’ve been through so much, but it’s not worth it anymore.”</p>',\n",

       " 'tax-treaties-vote': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">WASHINGTON — The Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to approve updates to international tax treaties, some of which were negotiated in the early years of the Obama administration, in a bipartisan victory for multinational companies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The so-called treaty protocols with Switzerland, Japan and Luxembourg were approved a day after senators passed a protocol with Spain. Two Republican senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, voted against approving all four treaties.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Getting to the votes required a multiyear lobbying campaign by some of the largest business groups in Washington, a coordinated push from the Trump administration and Senate Republican leadership — and the triumph of Kentucky’s senior senator, Mitch McConnell, over Mr. Paul, who had successfully stalled treaty approval for years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The protocols allow companies with operations in Spain, Switzerland, Japan and Luxembourg to avoid some previous tax penalties for transferring money to their operations abroad. They also update the existing treaties to allow for more detailed sharing of information on individual and corporate taxpayers between countries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Paul has long objected to those information-sharing provisions on privacy grounds, and he succeeded for years in holding up approval of the treaties because of it. He tried to block them in committee this year, and proposed privacy-related amendments to the Spain protocol on Monday. Those were voted down.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Wednesday, Mr. McConnell criticized Mr. Paul’s efforts — and sense of senatorial importance — on the Senate floor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The years of delays in getting these noncontroversial treaties ratified have cost American businesses that employ American workers millions and millions of dollars,” Mr. McConnell said. Referring to Mr. Paul, but not by name, he added, “Year after year, money that could have been immediately used to hire Americans or make new investments had to either be frozen up or handed over in duplicate taxes, all in large part because one of our colleagues could not accept that one single senator who hasn’t persuaded his fellow members is not entitled to single-handedly rewrite international treaties.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Paul had criticized Mr. McConnell in a speech on Tuesday evening, warning of privacy encroachment and accusing Mr. McConnell of short-circuiting Mr. Paul’s push for stronger protections.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The fact that this legislation hasn’t come up for several years is really due to the fact that the Republican leader has failed to engage in any meaningful compromise or discussion over these,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In his remarks, Mr. McConnell referred to a Kentucky company that had pushed hard for ratification of the protocol with Spain.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">North American Stainless is a subsidiary of Spain-based Acerinox and employs about 1,500 workers in Kentucky. A company executive told a Senate panel in 2014 that ratifying the tax protocol with Spain could lift Acerinox’s investments in Kentucky, by ending a 10 percent tax on dividend payments from the American subsidiary back to the parent company.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. McConnell said that “I happen to know” that the company had been considering a $30 million investment in America but, because of the delay in voting on the protocol, had to pay a $15 million tax bill in April that would not have been due under the revised treaty. If the delay had continued, he said, the company would have owed an additional $35 million.</p>',\n",

       " 'tour-de-france': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">ALBI, France — I was late, oh so late, and my car’s GPS had expired in the midst of remote vineyards and stands of cypress and golden fields of humanoid-looking sunflowers. So this American hurtled down medieval farm roads making wrong turns after wrong turns until, <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">miracle sacre</em>, I suddenly found myself at Hotel La Reserve, a handsome country hotel with manicured grounds and a glittering swimming pool. Attractive, if anxious-looking, young men and women parted, and at their center, sitting on a white couch, was poor Thibaut Pinot, the great hope to capture this tour for France.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He wore a 1,000-yard stare.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Tragedy had befallen him a day earlier. The Tour de France peloton, the amoeba-like mass of more than 100 cyclists who ride fast and hip-to-hip came to one of the ubiquitous roundabouts and Pinot and his team made a split-second decision to go left instead of right.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That exposed all to cutting crosswinds. He fell dozens of seconds off the pace, and that might as well have been two hours.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pinot cannot bring himself to say much at this news conference. So his manager, Marc Madiot, who had a great mane of white hair and a defiant jut to his chin, commanded the couch like a captain on his poop deck. As my French consists of a bouillabaisse of nouns and verbs, and conjugations that too rarely align, I understood little other than his many recitations of “jamais,” as in never give up, never surrender, never.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Afterward I sidled up to him and asked to have a few words in English. Madiot studied me wreathed in a truly fine sneer and said: “En francais! Seulement!” In French, only.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I was hungry and tired and feared my inner New Yorker coming on, seulement. Our country has enough diplomatic problems in Europe these days. I nodded and returned to those medieval roads.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So it goes in the Tour de France, that grandest of the world’s cycling races, a 2,162-mile pell-mell journey from the cobbled streets of Belgium across much fought-over Alsace-Lorraine to the scorching hills of the Côte d’Azur to the thoroughly humbling climbs of 5,000 and 6,000 feet in the Pyrenees and Alps and finally three weeks on down the Champs<!-- -->-<!-- -->Élysées in Paris.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I had parachuted in when the race was seven days on, which is like nosing your canoe into Class IV rapids. All was intensity and movement. I caught up with the cyclists as they cut across the Massif Central, an austere region of extinct volcanoes and lonely forests and white-tailed hawks soaring above chalky gorges.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I found my way to Lacalm, a 185-person hamlet that sits at 3,694 feet, the highest point of the race this day. As half the roads in the region were blocked to traffic, I had traveled remote roads, country lanes where you had to eye oncoming drivers and decide which of you would roll onto the grass to let the other pass.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As my belief in reincarnation is less than firm, I deferred.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Downtown Lacalm had a few dozen medieval homes, a shop or four and old bikes decorated merrily with paper carnations. A wrought iron crucifix with a writhing alabaster Jesus loomed over the town, which felt metaphorically appropriate given the imminent appearance of grimacing, lung-seared cyclists.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Up the road, we heard a great roar — un rugissement! — and I craned my neck looking for riders. None. Instead, it was the carnival that traveled across France with the riders, a collection of caterwauling, beeping knockoffs of Thanksgiving Day floats, sponsored by fried chicken and optical chains, sausage brands and an amusement park and Disney, and everyone moved at an alarming rate of speed. Men road stationary bikes atop these wobbling floats, and helpers sat in the cabs and tossed key chains and sun visors and candy at the feet of spectators. I got winged by a tchotchke advertising a medical service.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An older gentleman in camouflage pants and a beret came to a sliding stop at my feet as if he were a denizen of Fenway Park on the scent of a home run. He stood up holding a sun visor, which he waggled triumphantly at his wife, who sat by her flower boxes and looked pleased with her husband’s work.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The floats wove on down the road, the cyclists still an hour back.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The race this day stretched 136 miles and came to an end in Albi, a handsome medieval city on the Tarn River. A horde of cyclists sprinted in after 5 p.m., down a shaded avenue of shedding plane trees, the crowds six, seven deep, waving flags, loosening whistles and raising glasses of wine and beer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Earlier, this same Pinot made his fateful decision to go left rather than right, and he was disconsolate as he rolled to a stop, enfolded by sweaty television crews.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two of his team’s soigneurs (caretakers) sprinted over with bottle of water and a towel for Pinot, trying to wipe him down. Each team also has cyclists whose job it is to serve and sacrifice for the alpha cyclist with the best chance to win the Tour; they are known as domestiques<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.</em> Cycling terminology can be curiously upstairs-downstairs for what is at its core a working class sport.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What, reporters asked in four<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>languages at once, happened out there?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pinot shrugged and began to peddle away. “What do you want me to say? It was a [bleep] day.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is these vagaries, the unexpected roundabout, the too merry man waving a wine glass mid-road, the great green umbrella that was upended by the wind on an earlier day and landed in the middle of the peloton like Mary Poppins on LSD, that make this race so maddening and dangerous and yes, enjoyable. There is also the ever-present and always unspoken shadow of doping, a generational elixir for cyclists that just might be a touch rarer today.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Early the next morning I wandered over to the CCC team bus. The customized buses for these multimillion dollar cycling teams roll in each day like an armada of Man of War battleships. I fell into conversation with Jim Ochowicz, the president of that team and a veteran of many biking wars. He spoke of France, where the passion for cycling edges into religious passion.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is the Super Bowl,” he said, but with a difference. Football fields are 100 yards long with every detail controlled and manicured to the manic-obsessive inch.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Our venue is every road in France and each year the route is different,” he said. “If they are doing road work, if there is a pothole, you have a split second to deal with it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A bit of math: Over the 3,481 kilometers of the 2019 Tour, there are 3,576 ‘obstacles’: 404 roundabouts, 308 sections that narrow precipitously, 28 hairpin turns and 334 speed bumps, not to mention rail crossings and drunks. It adds up, Velonews.com noted, to one bone rattling distraction per kilometer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As we spoke cyclists glided effortlessly in and out of the crowds, like so many serene goldfish in a bowl. Imperceptibly at first a tension built and I said goodbye and moved with a herd of reporters down the road, following the bikes. Bands played, townspeople wave roared again and there was a bang and the peloton began to move out of Albi, the temperatures already in the mid-80s and with more than 100 miles of peddling ahead.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I ran to my car, trying to remember enough fractured French to work my way around those gendarmes manning the security barriers and then on to Toulouse.</p>',\n",

       " 'transfer-window-premier-league': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">LONDON — It had all the hallmarks of an afternoon of speed dating. Strangers hoping to find that right match.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On a gloriously warm Tuesday this week, a group of soccer executives, from clubs large and small from across Europe and even as far afield as Brazil and the United States, were getting to know each other at 15-minute intervals inside a banquet hall at Stamford Bridge, the West London home of Premier League giant Chelsea.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Outside, tourists visiting the stadium frolicked in the sunshine of the stands. Inside the cloistered, carpeted Centenary Lounge, executives were getting down to the serious business of negotiating player trades as the summer transfer window, an annual multibillion-dollar marketplace, reaches its climactic rush to fill rosters or find new or temporary homes for unwanted or untested talent before the window slams shut in a matter of weeks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With tables numbered and organized in rows, executives wielding brochures and tablets showed off their inventory in short introductory meetings that ended with the sound of a bell and the appearance of two women armed with boxing-style cards announcing the start of the next round of talks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The event, a novelty in the often opaque and secretive world of soccer player trading, is the brainchild of Jonas Ankersen, 33, of Denmark, who launched a player trading platform called Transfer Room two years ago. The idea was to wean clubs off the largely inefficient and long-held practice of sourcing and selling players via the closely guarded networks of agents or intermediaries, some who can take a multimillion-dollar cut in the biggest deals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I wanted to give the clubs a chance to take back control of the transfer market,” Ankersen said as snippets of negotiations started to fill the air following a break for lunch.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To be sure, this is not the place where Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi will move from one club to another, but rather where useful, reasonably priced players change teams. The most expensive player on Ankersen’s platform is valued at around £20 million, or roughly $25 million, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That’s just a little bit out of our price range,” said Mick Harford, the director of football at Luton Town, a team from just outside London that was promoted last season to the second tier Championship division. Harford spoke as he pored over a list of young players being made available for loan by Paul Konchesky, loan manager at the middling Premier League club West Ham.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Harford, a towering former striker, was in the market for players elite teams were looking to loan out — either young players needing the experience of first team soccer or older athletes who were unlikely to make the roster this season. The loan market is a backbone for clubs like his, Harford said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Executives in the room included representatives of Manchester City, last season’s Premier League champion, and Italian champion Juventus, which each summer is among soccer’s biggest buyers of talent. Juventus is also known to send more players out on loan than almost any other rival in European soccer. They were joined by a dozen other Premier League clubs and a bevy of others from across soccer’s global pyramid, including Internacional, a stalwart of Brazil’s top league, known for creating the type of talent suited to European soccer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the executives ranged in seniority and function, they were all club employees. They shared a mutual frustration, bordering on antipathy, for another critical cog in the wheels of the soccer market: agents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you can progress talks with the two clubs then you’re in a stronger position than an agent trying to broker deals, getting in this, getting that,” said Tony Coton, head of recruitment at Sunderland, a third-tier English team that was previously in the Premier League but was demoted twice.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Here I will hear it from the horse’s mouth now,” he continued, “exactly how much the player’s earning at that club and I can say, ‘Yes we can go to that,’ or ‘No we can’t go to that,’ without the agent getting involved because invariably the agent will inflate what he’s on to try and increase his wages and for a loan I don’t think that’s right.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Coton, a former goalkeeper for Manchester City, was in town like Harford to pick up a few loan players and to try to find buyers for two players from Sunderland’s Premier League days whose wages the club can no longer afford to finance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Fueled by an explosion in television rights revenue, the player trading market globally has doubled to $7 billion annually since 2014, according to FIFA, a rise that requires a more organized and serious approach than the relationship-based business that has historically existed, according to Rasmus Ankersen, Jonas’s brother, and the director of football at Brentford, which plays in England’s second-tier Championship division.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That informal structure has led to waste of as much as 10 percent, Rasmus Ankersen said, which would represent as much as $700 million based on FIFA’s total figures. The savings, he said, could come with more transparency in the marketplace, with clubs more easily knowing which players are available and the needs of other teams.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There will always be a need for someone to represent the player, an agent, and who can market the player, negotiate his contract. Where the waste in football is, is in what we call ‘club intermediaries’ — these guys that are in the middle, connecting clubs, holding the information, brokering the deals, that is in many cases an unnecessary cost,” Rasmus Ankersen said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Club-to-club meetings on a global scale like the one held in London remain uncommon. The scarcity is related to the baked-in paranoia of the soccer world, where clubs eye rivals’ motivations with great suspicion.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you stick a for sale sign up, you can weaken your stance in the market,” said Dan Ashworth, director of football at Brighton, a small club that will compete in the Premier League for the third straight season.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ashworth has recently returned to club soccer after six years with England’s national federation. His club hired a new coach, Graham Potter, at the start of the season, and that’s likely to mean more changes than usual as Brighton tries to build a squad matching Potter’s preferences. When such changes occur, players who would once have been seen as indispensable may no longer fit. Such conversations can be delicate, requiring careful handling before a player’s availability for transfer can be communicated to the market, said Ashworth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You are dealing with human beings, it’s not a product,” he said, sitting in the calm of a quiet corner of Stamford Bridge, during a rare lull in a full day. “So when you put a for-sale sign up for a person, that person might not know they’re for sale, might not know that you’re looking to move them on, might not agree to move away. Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A short while later, the bell sounded and Ashworth jumped to his feet. He had another date.</p>',\n",

       " 'trump-send-her-back-ilhan-omar': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">GREENVILLE, N.C. — President Trump road-tested his attacks on four Democratic congresswomen on Wednesday, casting them as avatars of anti-American radicalism and reiterating his call for them to leave the country, as a raucous crowd chanted, “Send her back! Send her back!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The performance here was a preview of a slash-and-burn re-election strategy that depicts Mr. Trump as a bulwark against a “dangerous, militant hard left.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force for evil,” Mr. Trump told a packed arena. To roaring applause, he railed against what he called “hate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They don’t love our country,” he said. “I think, in some cases, they hate our country. You know what? If they don’t love it, tell them to leave it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In recent days, similar comments by Mr. Trump have been met with repugnance across the country. But the capacity crowd in an arena at East Carolina University seemed to savor them. After Mr. Trump reeled off several controversial comments made by one of the four congresswomen, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, including ones that he depicted as sympathetic to Al Qaeda, the crowd started its “Send her back” chant, which could become the 2020 rejoinder to 2016’s “Lock her up!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was the latest sign that the president’s plan for winning a second term in office involves playing to racial and nationalist themes that shock the consciences of many Americans, but which seem to delight his most ardent supporters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump doubled down with relish on his previous calls for the congresswomen — Ms. Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts — <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-squad-congress.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> to “go back” to their countries of origin</a>, even though all but one were born in the United States and all four are citizens. It left no doubt that he was undaunted by furious condemnations of his remarks as racist, including a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/trump-tweet-house-vote.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Tuesday vote by the House</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As his raucous audience booed repeatedly at his mentions of the women, the atmosphere had echoes of a pro-wrestling match at which the crowd thrills in its collective disdain for the villain of the moment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wednesday night’s event was billed as a “Keep America Great” rally — a boastful variant of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”<br/></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Big Rally tonight in Greenville, North Carolina,” the president <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1151473175496146945\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">tweeted early Wednesday</a>, saying he would play up economic growth and the booming stock market in a state that has narrowly tilted right in the past two presidential contests.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many Republicans, including some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, wish he would stick to those themes, saying they think that he is overshadowing an economic success story by engaging in name-calling and divisive cultural clashes. Some feel that his relentless focus on immigration and other nationalist themes before last November’s midterm elections alienated suburban swing voters and helped enable Democrats to win the House.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But while the president did devote time to the nation’s recent economic growth, and took credit for data showing that China’s gross domestic product is growing at its slowest rate in 27 years, he was most animated when attacking his Democratic rivals, particularly Ms. Omar, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Pressley, who are collectively known as “the squad.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump denounced Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/ocasio-cortez-cheney-detention-centers.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">branding federal migrant detention centers</a> along the southwestern border “concentration camps,” saying she had, in effect, called border agents Nazis. And he recalled the way Ms. Tlaib <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/tlaib-impeach-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">had used</a> what he called a “vicious” expletive when <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/tlaib-impeach-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">she vowed</a> in January that Mr. Trump would be impeached.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That’s not somebody that loves our country,” the president said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump also ridiculed the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, like mocking the name of Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and saying that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had “choked” in the last Democratic primary debate after Senator Kamala Harris of California challenged him on the issue of busing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Depicting the 2020 Democrats as a hapless and left-wing lot, Mr. Trump delivered what may have been his core pitch: “Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American Dream — frankly, the destruction of our country.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump also boasted about an afternoon vote in the House on a resolution to impeach him that had been introduced by Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas. The measure, opposed by House Democratic leaders wary of a potential backlash, failed <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/house-impeachment-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> 332</a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/house-impeachment-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\"> to 95</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We just received an overwhelming vote against impeachment, and that is the end of it,” Mr. Trump said after his arrival to the rally. “Let the Democrats now go back to work.” The vote did not preclude the possibility of future impeachment action.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump first announced the rally shortly after House Democrats set Wednesday as the date for the former special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to testify about his report on Russian election interference. That was widely seen as an effort by the president to counterprogram that testimony, which has <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/house-democrats-mueller-hearings.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">since been delayed</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During his speech on Wednesday, he only briefly mentioned the investigation, denouncing it as “a hoax,” and never mentioned Mr. Mueller.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/north-carolina?module=inline\" title=\"\">carried North Carolina in 2016</a> with 49.8 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton’s 46.2 percent.

       " 'tupac-lyrics-email-jerry-foxhoven': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The timing certainly seemed suspicious. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One day last month, Jerry Foxhoven, 66, the director of Iowa’s Department of Human Services, sent an email celebrating the rapper Tupac Shakur to all 4,300 agency employees. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A few days later, he was ordered to resign. <!-- -->Some of his former employees thought the email was to blame. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But, in a phone interview, Mr. Foxhoven said his frequent quoting of Tupac at work — detailed in 350 pages of internal emails first obtained <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.apnews.com/c7ae931fae0f4bc1a0fe3386e4b5bc38\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">by The Associated Press</a> — was simply intended to raise morale at the troubled agency. He did not believe it led to his removal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think it’s a coincidence,” Mr. Foxhoven said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He explained that the office of Gov. Kim Reynolds had requested a meeting with him days before he sent the office-wide email June 14. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In that message, Mr. Foxhoven reminded employees that Father’s Day was coming up and that it coincided with Tupac’s birthday, June 16. He included what he said was “an inspirational quote”: “Pay no mind to those who talk behind your back; it simply means that you are two steps <!-- -->ahead<!-- -->.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The emails obtained by The A.P., and later by The New York Times, show that Mr. Foxhoven, who described himself as “a 66-year-old white guy,” often referred to Tupac in messages, and even held “Tupac Fridays” in the office. A birthday party featured cookies decorated with the phrase “Thug Life.” He also quoted other celebrities in holiday-themed messages.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The emails show that many employees responded positively. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I love your 2Pac messages,” one manager wrote June 14. “And the fact that you still send them (despite the haters) makes me appreciate them even more.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The next Monday, Mr. Foxhoven said, he met with Ms. Reynolds’s chief of staff and was told that the governor wanted to take the agency in a different direction. He agreed to resign. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Reynolds, a Republican, had praised Mr. Foxhoven as a “compassionate, thoughtful leader” when she <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://governor.iowa.gov/2017/06/gov-reynolds-appoints-jerry-foxhoven-as-director-of-iowa-department-of-human-services\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">appointed him</a> in June 2017. He had previously worked as a lawyer, professor and children’s rights advocate. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said he had been brought in to “right the ship” and raise morale during a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/dhss-foxhoven-morale-not-good-among-child-abuse-investigators\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">period of turmoil</a> at the agency, including fallout from the deaths of two teenagers who had been adopted out of foster care and major problems with the Medicaid system.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We made a lot of progress,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added that many directors do not serve long terms, and that his two-year tenure meant that he had outlasted many of his predecessors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Reynolds had served as lieutenant governor under Terry Branstad, who was nominated as ambassador to China in December 2016. She assumed the governor’s office in 2017 and won an election for the seat the next year. Mr. Foxhoven said he believed she was simply filling posts with “more political people.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Her office did not return calls on Wednesday. Last month, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/24/iowa-kim-reynolds-office-no-records-agency-leaders-exit-jerry-foxhoven-dhs-medicaid-resignation/1546718001/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">she told reporters</a> that “a lot of factors” had gone into the decision to remove Mr. Foxhoven, but would not say whether the move was tied to disciplinary action. Gerd W. Clabaugh, the director of the Department of Public Health, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.rcreader.com/news-releases/gov-kim-reynolds-appoints-gerd-w-clabaugh-interim-director-department-human-services\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">was appointed</a> as interim director of human services.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Foxhoven said his quoting of Tupac and his holiday messages were meant to “add a little levity and humanness” to the office. He added that he had been a Tupac fan since the ’90s. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I would say Tupac is by far my favorite, second would be Snoop Dogg,” he said, adding that he also likes jazz and rock. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Tupac, who was 25 <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/arts/tupac-shakur-25-rap-performer-who-personified-violence-dies.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">when he was gunned down</a> in Las Vegas in 1996, could be a controversial figure; critics said he glorified gang life. But he is widely seen as one of the greatest rappers ever, praised for his lyricism and the forthright way he addressed pressing social issues.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Foxhoven said that he appreciated the socially conscious messages in Tupac’s work, and that he had shared only quotations that fit with the agency’s mission.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He referred to a poem Tupac wrote called “The Rose That Grew From Concrete.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think the message that he had was very much in tune with what we say about helping families and children in today’s world,” he said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Mark Walker contributed reporting from Washington. </em></p>',\n",

       " 'un-drug-resistance-antibiotics': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With<!-- --> more and more common medications losing their ability to fight dangerous infections, and few new drugs in the pipeline, the world is facing an imminent crisis that could lead to millions of deaths, a surge in global poverty and an even wider gap between rich and poor countries, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/final-report/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the United Nations warned in a report on Monday</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Drug-resistant infections already claim 700,000 lives a year, including 230,000 deaths from drug-resistant tuberculosis, the report said. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">The rampant overuse of antibiotics and antifungal medicines</a> in humans, livestock and agriculture is accelerating a crisis that is poorly understood by the public and largely ignored by world leaders. Without concerted action, a United Nations <!-- -->panel <!-- -->said, resistant infections could kill 10 million people annually by 2050 and trigger an economic slowdown to rival the global financial crisis of 2008.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The problem threatens people around the world. During the next 30 years, the United Nations experts said, 2.4 million people in Europe, North America and Australia could die from drug-resistant infections, making routine hospital procedures like knee-replacement surgery and childbirth far riskier than they are today.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is a silent tsunami,” said Dr. Haileyesus Getahun, director of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">U.N. Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance</a>, which spent two years working on the report. “We are not seeing the political momentum we’ve seen in other public health emergencies, but if we don’t act now, antimicrobial resistance will have a disastrous impact within a generation.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The group, a collaboration of public health experts, government ministers and industry officials, called for the creation of an independent body with the stature and funding of the United Nations’ panel on climate change.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The report’s dire predictions seek to raise public awareness and shake political leaders into action. It proposes a series of measures that health officials say could help stem the rise of drug-resistant pathogens. The recommendations include a worldwide ban on the use of medically important antibiotics for promoting growth in farm animals; financial incentives for drug companies to develop new antimicrobial compounds; and more stringent rules to limit the sale of antibiotics in countries where drugs can often be bought at convenience stores without a prescription.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[Read our series </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/deadly-germs-lost-cures?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Deadly Germs, Lost Cures</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The report also highlights underappreciated factors in the spread of drug-resistant germs: the lack of clean water and inadequate sewage systems that sicken millions of people in the developing world. Many of them are too poor to see a doctor and instead buy <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/health/antibiotic-resistance-kenya-drugs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">cheap antibiotics from street vendors</a> with little medical expertise. Sometimes they unknowingly purchase counterfeit drugs, a problem that leads to millions of deaths, most of them in Africa.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To reduce outbreaks of infectious disease, the report says, wealthier nations should help poor countries pay for improvements to public hygiene, and ensure greater access to vaccines and properly manufactured antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Health officials are struggling to understand the scope of the problem because many countries are ill-equipped to monitor drug-resistant infections. In a survey the United Nations conducted for the report, 39 of 146 nations were unable to provide data on the use of antimicrobials in animals, which experts say is a major driver of resistance in humans <!-- -->as resistant bacteria get transferred to people through contaminated food and water.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are flying pretty blind and working hard to get some clear vision,” said Sally Davies, the chief medical officer of England and a leader of the United Nations panel.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As a first step, the report calls on member states of the United Nations to create national stewardship plans to reduce the unnecessary use of antimicrobials.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A key element of the report is a call for new incentives to encourage the development of antimicrobial medicines. Between 2010 and 2014, six new antimicrobial drugs were approved, most of them additions to existing drug classes, according to the World Health Organization. By contrast, 19 new <!-- -->antimicrobial<!-- --> drugs were approved between 1980 and 1984.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The dearth of new drugs is tied to the perverse economics of antimicrobial resistance and the free market. It can cost a half-billion dollars to develop a new compound, but doctors are discouraged from using the drugs to reduce the possibility that the targeted pathogens will become resistant. Even when doctors prescribe the drugs, most patients take them for a week or two, limiting a drug company’s ability to earn back its initial investment. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Everyone agrees that there is an absolute need for new antibiotics but there is no sustainable market,” said Thomas Cueni, director general of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ifpma.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &amp; Associations</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Incentives to develop new drugs could include generous government financing for research, or regulatory changes that would increase reimbursements for newly approved antibiotics considered medically important. According to the World Bank, such investments would quickly pay for themselves; it notes that containing antimicrobial resistance costs $9 billion annually.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I applaud the U.N. for at least putting incentives on the map, but there needs to be more than talk,” said Mr. Cueni, who also chairs the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.amrindustryalliance.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">AMR Industry Alliance</a>, a trade group working to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance. “What’s needed is money.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, many public health advocates said the report was an important step in elevating a crisis that has failed to garner the attention of other global problems like climate change and AIDS. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lance Price, director of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://battlesuperbugs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Antibiotic Resistance Action Center</a> at George Washington University, said he worried the report might not gain much traction with the Trump administration, which has been averse to multilateral cooperation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Fear, he said, was the key to changing the status quo.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Even if you don’t care about the suffering of people who drink unclean water and get resistant infections, you still have to recognize that these bacteria don’t recognize international borders,” he said. “They will come here, and they will kill us. We have to let people know that the problem is closer than they think.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p>',\n",

       " 'underwire-bra-x-ray-machine': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The metal detector at the Jackson County Detention Center in Kansas City, Mo., beeped repeatedly when Laurie Snell, a lawyer, tried to enter the facility on May 31.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She was passing through security on her way to visit a client, but something she was wearing was setting off the detector. She removed her shoes, her jewelry and her glasses. Then she realized the problem was her bra.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So Ms. Snell ducked into a bathroom, removed the undergarment and put it into a bin for the X-ray machine. That got her through security. Then, in the privacy of an elevator cabin, she wriggled back into the bra as quickly as she could.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Thankfully my client was on seven, which is the top floor,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Snell was among the first to point out that the metal detector at the detention center was reacting to women’s bras. She was not the last. Over the past two months, the issue has spawned a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://jacksonco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&amp;clip_id=3721\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">legislative debate</a>, a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/jackson-county-attorneys-protest-new-jail-security-measures\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">public protest</a> and a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://media.kansascity.com/livegraphics/2019/pdf/screening-policy-open-letter.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">deadlock</a> between a group of lawyers and the county authorities.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The standoff, nicknamed “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.kcur.org/post/bra-gate-escalates-jackson-county-jail-doubles-down-universal-screening-policies#stream/0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Bra-Gate</a>,” echoed other episodes in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://fox43.com/2018/01/30/women-turned-away-from-visitation-at-lancaster-county-prison-after-wearing-underwire-bras/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Pennsylvania</a>, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://bangordailynews.com/2017/03/06/news/state/maine-state-prison-bra-removal-policy-reversed-after-women-file-complaints/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Maine</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/detention-centre-visitors-say-they-ve-been-given-a-bizarre-bra-warning-20190712-p526qu.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Australia</a>, where bras have fueled similar debates over security, privacy and gender discrimination. In Kansas City, the situation took on additional legal significance when a lawyer announced on Friday that a sex discrimination complaint had been filed on behalf of a corrections employee.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The employee, Charlotte Hardin, is a legal librarian who removed her bra to pass through security. The lawsuit was filed against the county last month, after she was put on administrative leave, her lawyer said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is important to note that males are allowed to remove their belts and shoes and send them through the X-ray machine, then retrieve them and wear them in the secure perimeter,” her lawyer, Katherine Myers, said in a statement. “Yet females are not permitted to do the same with their underwire bras.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Diana Turner, the director of the Jackson County Corrections Department, said she could not comment on the complaint except to say that Ms. Hardin was not placed on leave for putting her bra through the X-ray.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She added that she could not understand the pushback against what she called a routine security measure. “We’ve got to take care of our staff,” she said. “We’re doing the best that we can with very limited resources in a jail that is grossly understaffed and overcrowded.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Jackson County Detention Center had <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://fox4kc.com/2018/05/11/grand-jury-releases-report-on-jackson-county-jail-conditions-demands-action-by-county-leaders/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">reportedly been struggling with serious safety and security issues</a> when Sheriff Darryl Forté <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JCSheriffOffice/status/1078761974748598273\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">took over administration of the jail</a> in January. A new policy in mid-May required everyone entering the facility — including lawyers with credentials — to pass through the metal detector.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Snell, the lawyer, said she accepted that decision but did not understand why security agents could not use a wand metal detector or a pat-down — as many airports do — to clear women who had set off the main metal detector.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Nobody is against security,” she said. “We’re just in favor of fairness.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Molly Hastings, a former public defender who is now a private lawyer, said she did not think the county was being discriminatory on purpose. “We have this unintended consequence of singling out women because of their undergarments,” she said. “This could have been addressed. It’s mind-numbing. I don’t know why we’re talking about it still.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Not every bra has the type of metal underwire that sets off the detector in Kansas City. Ms. Turner said that people passed through the detention facility’s detector more than 700 times a day on average, and that the vast majority of them had no problem at all.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have never asked someone to remove their undergarments,” Ms. Turner added. “The recent conflict has been people trying to put undergarments into the X-ray bin, and we consider that unacceptable, because there’s no way it ends well for our agency with our screening officers having to handle undergarments.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wands were not a good option either, she said, because they could not differentiate between underwire and a contraband item. And she added that lawyers who cannot pass through the metal detector are still allowed to interact with their clients through plexiglass.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Tracy Spradlin, a lawyer who regularly visits clients in the detention center, said that was not a fair option. “We cannot meaningfully exchange documents with them that way, and we cannot have free conversations,” she said, adding that the new policy disproportionately affects women in what is already a male-dominated field.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On June 12, dozens of lawyers opposed to the policy demonstrated in front of the Jackson County Courthouse in Kansas City. “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.kctv5.com/news/kansas-city-lawyers-chant-we-need-support-to-protest-bra/article_f8062320-8d63-11e9-90dd-034dc9ca2de8.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">We need support</a>,” they chanted. Some of their signs mentioned the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to a speedy trial — a nod to the fact that if female lawyers cannot get through security for in-person consultations, their clients suffer, too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Neither Ms. Spradlin nor Ms. Hastings has had a problem getting through the metal detector, nor did they know how many women were affected in total. But Ms. Hastings said she knew of more than a dozen, and Ms. Spradlin pointed out that facility employees, whose paychecks depend on corrections authorities, might be reluctant to speak up if there were a problem.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Hastings said county officials have been incommunicative and resistant to even simple solutions, like implementing a second screening method.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The complete refusal to be reasonable — that’s just been mind-boggling,” she said.</p>',\n",

This is shocking,” said Lance Price, director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center<!-- --> at George Washington University, who was not involved in the research. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The drug ampicillin,<!-- --> once a mainstay for treating the infections, has been abandoned as a gold standard because multiple strains of U.T.I.s are resistant to it. Some urinary tract infections now require treatment with heavy-duty intravenous antibiotics. Researchers last year reported in a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31077-8/fulltext\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">study</a> that a third of all U.T.I.s in Britain are resistant to “key antibiotics.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Certainly, the day-to-day experience of having a U.T.I. is growing less routine for many women.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Carolina Barcelos, 38, a postdoctoral researcher in Berkeley, Calif., said she had several U.T.I.s as a teenager, all successfully treated with Bactrim. When she got one in February, her doctor also prescribed Bactrim, but this time it didn’t work.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Four days later, she returned and got a new prescription, for a drug called nitrofurantoin.<!-- --> It didn’t work either. Her pain worsened, and several days later, there was blood in her urine.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Her doctor prescribed a third drug, ciprofloxacin<!-- -->,<!-- --> the last of the three major front-line medicines, and cultured her urine. The culture showed her infection was susceptible to the new drug, but not the other two.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Next time,” Dr. Barcelos said, “I’m going to ask them to do a culture right away. For eight days I was taking antibiotics that weren’t working for me.”</p><p class=\"css-1vs7yia interactive-leadin\" data-testid=\"leadin\" id=\"interactive-leadin\">A New York Times journalist may follow up with you, and we may publish a selection of the responses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Usually, it is people with weakened immune systems or chronic medical conditions who are most vulnerable to drug-resistant infections, but U.T.I.s have a dubious distinction: They are the single biggest risk to healthy people from drug-resistant germs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Resistance to antibiotics has become one of the world’s most pressing health issues. <!-- -->Overuse of the drugs in humans and livestock <!-- -->has caused germs to develop defenses to survive, rendering a growing number of medicines ineffective in treating a wide range of illnesses — a phenomenon that is playing out worldwide with U.T.I.s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The World Health Organization, while noting that data on urinary tract infections and drug resistance is “scarce,”<!-- --> said the fact the infections were so common strongly suggested that increasing resistance would lead to more severe illnesses and fatalities.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The solution, researchers and clinicians say, includes a continued push for more judicious use of antibiotics worldwide. But more immediately, a partial solution would be the development of quick, cheap diagnostic tools that would allow an instant urine culture so that a doctor could prescribe the right drug for U.T.I.s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But whether to wait the several days it usually takes to get lab results before prescribing presents a tough dilemma for doctors and patients, who frequently are desperate for relief. Plus, depending on a person’s insurance, getting a culture can be expensive.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Generally doctors still do not order a urine culture before prescribing an antibiotic.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In the old days, the list of antibiotic options was short but by and large they would all work,” said Dr. James Johnson, <!-- --> an infectious disease professor and leading researcher on urinary tract infections at the University of Minnesota.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some women have U.T.I.s that the body fights off on its own without using antibiotics, while other women may have a different low-level ailment that feels like a U.T.I., but isn’t. The safest course is to see a doctor and make an informed decision that includes a judicious determination of whether antibiotics are warranted. The science does not support the efficacy of some popular remedies like cranberry juice or cranberry pills.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Officials from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that U.T.I.s acquired by otherwise healthy people were a growing concern and one poorly studied. They are not tracked nationally.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In older people, urinary tract infections can be deadly, but tracking in the United States is so weak that there are no reliable estimates on the numbers of deaths related to the infections. The C.D.C. published an estimate of 13,000 per year, but that figure comes from <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1820440/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a paper looking at 2002 data</a> and refers only to U.T.I.s acquired in hospitals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Clifford McDonald, <!-- --> associate director for science in the division of health care quality promotion at the C.D.C., said the government planned to expand its research.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If we don’t do something soon,” Dr. McDonald said, “it’s going to push all our treatments to more advanced antibiotics that finally put a lot of pressure on the last-line treatments.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What makes these infections so dangerous, and commonplace, is human anatomy. In women, the urethra — the gateway to the urinary tract — is in proximity to the rectum. This can lead to easy transfer of bacteria in fecal residue that otherwise resides harmlessly in the gut. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In reproductive years, women are 50 times more likely than men to have a urinary tract infection; later in life, the ratio drops to 2 to 1, as men wind up having surgical procedures on their prostate, or catheters, that more easily expose their urinary tracts to infection.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There are multiple germs that cause U.T.I.s, and their resistance levels to drugs vary both by strain and <!-- -->by where a patient lives<!-- -->. By far the most common cause of U.T.I.s today is E. coli, and, in general, those infections have seen <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://aac.asm.org/content/60/5/2680\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">sharp rises in resistance </a>to gold standard treatments over the past decade and a half.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">New research shows that one crucial path of transfer of germs that cause U.T.I.s is food, most often poultry. The consumed poultry winds up in a person’s gut and can get transferred through fecal residue to the urethra.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A study published last year by the American Society of Microbiology, funded partly by the C.D.C., found 12 strains of E. coli in poultry that matched widely circulating urinary tract infection strains. One of the study’s authors, Dr. Lee Riley, <!-- --> a professor of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the University of California, Berkeley, said he was working on a C.D.C.-funded project to determine whether the urinary tract infection needs to be classified and reported as a food-borne illness.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> Dr. Brad Frazee,<!-- --> an emergency room doctor at Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif., has been a co-author of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29980462\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">research</a> that adds another troubling wrinkle: Increasingly, E. coli is proving resistant not just to individual antibiotics, but also to a broad group of drugs known as beta-lactam antibiotics. <!-- --> These drugs share a way of attacking infection, and when a germ develops resistance to this method of attack, it eliminates several key treatment options all at once. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Recently, a woman carrying such resistance showed up at Dr. Frazee’s hospital, he said. She wound up with pyelonephritis,<!-- --> an infection in the kidney, and had to be treated in the hospital intravenously with a drug called ertapenem<!-- --> that can cost $1,000 a dose. A study found that around 5 percent of U.T.I.s at the hospital carried this resistance. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Doctors are now confronting cases of resistant urinary tract infections in their practices. Dr. Eva Raphael,<!-- --> a primary care physician in San Francisco, recently received notice that one of her patients, a healthy woman in her mid-30s, was back in the emergency room with another U.T.I. that was resistant to multiple antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of her prior U.T.I.s had failed to respond to two commonly used treatments and had spread to her kidney, requiring hospitalization to receive intravenous antibiotics. This time Dr. Raphael consulted with infectious disease specialists.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It can be quite dangerous in this age where there is more and more resistance,” she said, noting that without effective treatment the infection can get into the blood. “It can be fatal.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p>',\n",

       " 'uswnt-equal-pay-ad': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of U.S. Soccer’s official sponsors has sided with the World Cup-winning United States women’s team in its fight with the federation for equal pay, urging its partner, the governing body for soccer in the United States, “to be on the right side of history.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The sponsor, Procter &amp; Gamble, declared its support for equal pay in a full-page advertisement in Sunday’s editions of The New York Times. It is the first of more than a dozen U.S. Soccer partners and sponsors to side so openly with the team in the equal pay fight, and its support could increase the pressure on federation officials on the eve of mediation discussions to try to resolve the players’ federal gender discrimination lawsuit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/rory-smith?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">For more soccer news and analysis sign up for The Times’s weekly soccer newsletter: Rory Smith: On Soccer</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Procter &amp; Gamble, which supports U.S. Soccer through its Secret deodorant brand, also said it was making a donation of $529,000 to the women’s national team’s players association, which represents the team’s interests in its dealings with U.S. Soccer. The figure was symbolic, the company said: $23,000 for each member of the 23-player World Cup roster.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Inequality is about more than pay and players,” Procter &amp; Gamble said in the ad. “It’s about values.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">All of U.S. Soccer’s sponsors have embraced the team since <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/sports/soccer/world-cup-final-uswnt.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">its 2-0 victory over the Netherlands in the World Cup final</a>. Nike, for example, released <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S29GZOR-k9U\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a 60-second ad</a> almost as soon as the title was secure on July 7; its message stressed equality for women’s sports and support for women’s empowerment generally, but unlike Secret, it did not explicitly call for equal pay for the women’s team.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Megan Rapinoe, one of the team’s co-captains, stressed the power of that kind of corporate support in an appearance Sunday morning on “Meet the Press,” and she urged other companies to follow suit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These are some of the most powerful corporations, not just in sports but in the world, and have so much weight that they can throw around,” she said. “And I think that they just need to get comfortable with throwing it around.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The women’s team and U.S. Soccer have been in a public fight over equal pay and support for years. In 2016, the team filed <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a wage-discrimination complaint</a> with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, citing figures that its lawyers said showed the women players could expect to earn tens of thousands of dollars less than their male counterparts for the same work. A year later, after months of talks, the team and the federation agreed to terms on <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-soccer-labor-deal-contract.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a new collective bargaining agreement</a> that included improved pay and working conditions, but by this March the sides were publicly at odds again. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Frustrated by the lack of progress on their E.E.O.C. complaint, the players petitioned to withdraw it, and instead 28 members of the team sued U.S. Soccer in federal court, accusing the federation of years of “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">institutionalized gender discrimination</a>.” The discrimination, the team said, affects not only their paychecks but also where they play and how often, the medical treatment and quality of coaching they receive, and even how they travel to matches and the hotels in which they stay.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While Procter &amp; Gamble is the first U.S. Soccer sponsor to enter the players’ fight so directly, it is not the first corporation to make a financial commitment to the players. Days before the World Cup, Visa announced a five-year sponsorship that it said requires that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertkidd/2019/05/30/visa-make-substantial-investment-to-support-womens-soccer/#4f5753383202\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">at least half of its investment</a> be directed toward the women’s national team and other women’s programs. And in April, the energy-bar maker Luna Bar promised each player who made the Women’s World Cup roster <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.clifbar.com/press-room/press-releases/luna-r-bar-moves-u-s-women-s-national-soccer-team-one-step-closer-to-equal-pay\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a $31,250 bonus</a>; the payments, Luna Bar said, represented the difference in the World Cup roster bonuses paid to the United States men’s and women’s teams.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet even those bonuses highlighted <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/sports/soccer/usmnt-uswnt-soccer-equal-pay.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the complicated, and nuanced, debate about equal pay</a>. In one of the most obvious differences, players on the men’s and women’s national teams compete under separate collective bargaining agreements with U.S. Soccer. The men, who benefit from much higher club salaries, have prioritized higher match and victory bonuses from the federation, while the women, who still make the bulk of their on-field income from U.S. Soccer, long had agreed to lower national-team bonuses in exchange for the security of guaranteed salaries. The biggest difference in compensation for World Cup success overall continues to be the bonuses provided to participating teams by FIFA, world soccer’s governing body. Those bonuses are more than 10 times as high for men’s teams as they are for women’s squads.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The debate about equal treatment in women’s soccer is not new. In 2012, it even played out in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/sports/olympics/for-japans-women-winning-changes-things-but-not-everything.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the seating arrangements</a> when Japan’s soccer teams flew to the London Olympics on the same plane: The women’s team, which had won the World Cup a year earlier, rode in premium economy while the men sat in business class. But the momentum in the equal pay debate, driven by powerful voices on the United States women’s team like Rapinoe, Alex Morgan and others, had been building behind the American players even before their victory in France. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the week since the team claimed its second consecutive World Cup title, fans, companies and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-signs-equal-pay-legislation-into-law-at-uswnt-world-cup-victory-parade/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">politicians</a> have rushed to the players’ cause: After the United States’ victory over the Netherlands, fans chanted “Equal Pay!” inside the stadium, and days later the phrase was shouted repeatedly during the team’s victory parade and celebration in New York.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In interviews, even Rapinoe has acknowledged that pay was only one kind of equality in “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/PodSaveAmerica/status/1149490038608027648\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a complex argument</a>.” On the eve of mediation talks with U.S. Soccer over the gender discrimination lawsuit, comments like hers de-emphasizing pay as the team’s solitary concern might be a signal to the federation that the players are not staking out a winner-take-all position. Having major corporations in their union’s corner, though, can only help.<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“For brands, and especially a brand that is also a U.S. Soccer sponsor, to support our players both financially and publicly is hugely significant and important,” Becca Roux, the executive director of the national team’s players association, said Sunday morning. “Equity and pay equity are systemic issues that need systemic solutions. Corporations are powerful, influential players within the system that can spur massive change for good.”</p>',\n",

Cuba’s disastrous unraveling in the 1990s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/world/americas/venezuela-russia-economy.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FVenezuela&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">crumbling of Venezuela’s economy</a> has now outpaced them all.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Venezuela’s fall is the single largest economic collapse outside of war in at least 45 years, economists say.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s really hard to think of a human tragedy of this scale outside civil war,” said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. “This will be a touchstone of disastrous policies for decades to come.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To find similar levels of economic devastation, economists at the I.M.F. pointed to countries that were ripped apart by war, like Libya earlier this decade or Lebanon in the 1970s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Venezuela, at one point Latin America’s wealthiest country, has not been shattered by armed conflict. Instead, economists say, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/world/americas/venezuela-collapse-analysis-interpreter.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">poor governance, corruption and misguided policies</a> of President Nicolás Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, have fueled runaway inflation, shuttered businesses and brought the country to its knees. And in recent months, the Trump administration has imposed stiff sanctions to try to cripple it further.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the country’s economy plummeted, armed gangs took control of entire towns, public services collapsed and the purchasing power of most Venezuelans has been reduced to a couple of kilograms of flour a month.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In markets, butchers hit by regular blackouts jostle to sell decomposing stock by sunset. Former laborers scavenge through garbage piles for leftovers and recyclable plastic. Dejected retailers make dozens of trips to the bank in hopes of depositing several pounds’ worth of bills made worthless by hyperinflation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here in Maracaibo, a city of two million on the border with Colombia, nearly all of the butchers in the main market have stopped selling meat cuts in favor of offal and leftovers like fat shavings and cow hooves, the only animal protein many of their customers can still afford.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The crisis has been compounded by American sanctions intended to force Mr. Maduro to cede power to the nation’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó. The Trump administration’s recent <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/politics/venezuela-sanctions-trump-oil.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">sanctions on Venezuela’s state oil company</a> have made it difficult for the government to sell its main commodity, oil. Together with the American ban on trading Venezuelan bonds, the administration has made it harder for Venezuela to import any goods, including food and medication.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Maduro blames the widespread <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/17/world/americas/venezuela-children-starving.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">hunger</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/americas/venezuela-patients-hospital.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">lack of medical supplies</a> on the United States and its opposition allies — but most independent economists say the recession began years before the sanctions, which at most accelerated the collapse.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are fighting a savage battle against international sanctions that have made Venezuela lose at least $20 billion in 2018,” Mr. Maduro told supporters in a recent speech. “They are pursuing our bank accounts, our purchases abroad of any products. It’s more than a blockade, it’s persecution.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Shortages have sunk much of the population in a deepening humanitarian crisis, though a core group of military top brass and high-level officials who remain loyal to Mr. Maduro are able to tap into the remaining resources to survive — or <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-hezbollah-drugs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">even enrich themselves through illicit means</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To many, it seems each month brings record lows.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. But its oil output, once Latin America’s largest, has fallen faster in the past year than Iraq’s after the American invasion in 2003, according to data from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Venezuela has lost a tenth of its population in the past two years as people fled, even <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/americas/venezuela-refugees-colombia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">trekking across mountains</a>, setting off Latin America’s biggest ever refugee crisis.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Venezuela’s hyperinflation, expected to reach 10 million percent this year according to the I.M.F., is on track to become the longest period of runaway price rises since that in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1990s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is essentially a total collapse in consumption,” said Sergi Lanau, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a financial trade association.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The institute estimates that the drop in Venezuela’s economic output under Mr. Maduro has undergone the steepest decline by any country not at war since at least 1975.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By year’s end, Venezuela’s gross domestic product will have shrunk by 62 percent since the beginning of the recession in 2013, which coincided with Mr. Maduro coming to power, according to the finance institute’s estimates. (Venezuela’s government hasn’t released official macroeconomic statistics since 2014, forcing economists to rely on indicators like imports to estimate economic activity.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By contrast, the median economic decline in the former Soviet republics was about 30 percent during the peak of the crisis in the mid-1990s, the institute calculates.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For now, the government is concentrating its scarce resources in the capital, Caracas. But the state’s presence is melting in the hinterlands, an absence that has been particularly glaring in Zulia, Venezuela’s most populous state.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Caribbean Sea</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">TOAS I.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">Maracaibo</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">Caracas</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">Machiques</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">ZULIA</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">venezuela</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">colombia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">brazil</p><p class=\"g-pstyle7\">200 MILES</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Its capital, Maracaibo, was once Venezuela’s oil powerhouse. A <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/americas/venezuela-blackout-maracaibo.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">blackout</a> in March plunged the state into a week of darkness and chaos that left about 500 businesses ransacked.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Power has been sporadic ever since, exacerbating longstanding water and gasoline shortages and leaving towns without functional banking systems and cellphone coverage for days on end.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The flea market, a once-bustling maze of stalls from which vendors hawked food and household goods, has become the face of this crisis.<br/></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Juan Carlos Valles arrives at his tiny canteen in a corner of the market by 5 a.m. and begins making a broth out of beef bones and frying corn pastries in the darkness. He says his stall has been without power since March, his sales are down 80 percent since last year and each day is a struggle against soldiers who force him to accept nearly worthless low-denomination bills.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whatever money he makes he immediately invests in more bones and corn flour, because prices go up daily.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you take a rest, you lose,” said Mr. Valles, who has run his canteen since 1998. “The money has become worthless. By the time you take it to the bank, you have already lost some of it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Real incomes in Venezuela have fallen to levels last seen in the country in 1979, according to the international finance institute, leaving many to survive by collecting firewood, gathering fruit and fetching water in streams.<br/></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The government is talking about solutions in the long and medium term, but the hunger is now,” said Miguel González, the head of the community council at Maracaibo’s Arco Iris shantytown.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said he lost his job at a hotel when looters ransacked it in March, ripping out even window frames and cable wiring. He now collects wild plums to sell for a few cents in the city’s parks. Most of his community’s diet now consists of wild fruits, fried corn pastries and bone broth, residents said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Farther from the state capital, conditions are worse.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Toas Island, once a touristic idyll of about 12,000 residents spread over fishing hamlets, has been largely abandoned.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There’s no local, regional or national government here,” said José Espina, a motorbike taxi driver there. “We’re on our own.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Electricity and running water are available for only a few hours a day. The boat that provided regular service to the mainland broke down last month. An oil barge lent by the state oil company occasionally tugs a rusty ferry carrying meager supplies of subsidized food — a precarious lifeline for the island’s poorer residents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hyperinflation has reduced the island’s entire budget to the equivalent of $400 a month, or just 3 cents per estimated resident, according to the mayor, Hector Nava.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The hospital has no medication and no patients. The last person to be hospitalized died in agony a day later without treatment for her kidney disease, doctors at the hospital said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As Toas hospital’s beds stand empty, 2-year-old Anailin Nava is wasting away in a nearby hut from malnutrition and treatable muscular paralysis. Her mother, Maibeli Nava, does not have money to take her to Colombia for treatment, she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The four stone quarries that are the island’s only industry have been idle since robbers stole all power cables connecting them to the grid last year. Local opposition activists estimate up to a third of the residents have emigrated from the island in the past two years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It used to be a paradise,” said Arturo Flores, the local municipality’s security coordinator, who sells a fermented corn drink from a bucket to local fishermen to round up his salary, which is equivalent to $4 a month. “Now, everyone is fleeing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On the other side of Zulia state, in the ranching town of Machiques, the economic collapse has decimated the meat and dairy industries that had supplied the country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Power cuts have idled the local slaughterhouse, once one of the largest in Latin America. Armed gangs extort and rustle cattle from the surviving ranchers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You can’t produce if there’s no law,” said Rómulo Romero, a local rancher.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Local shopkeepers have pulled together to repair power lines and keep telecom towers running, to feed public workers, and to procure diesel for backup generators.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have practically taken on the functions of the state,” said Juan Carlos Perrota, a butcher who runs Machiques’ chamber of commerce. “We can’t just put a lock on the door and call it quits. We have hope that this will improve.”</p>',\n",

Opposition leaders <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/americas/venezuela-guaido-maduro.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fnicholas-casey&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\" title=\"\">are calling for an uprising</a>, while the country’s military and civilian authorities are refusing to surrender power, presenting a largely united show of force against the protests in the streets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the intelligence documents offer an unusual window into how fractured and nervous the nation’s security services have become, particularly over corruption at the highest levels of government.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. El Aissami, a former vice president who is now Mr. Maduro’s industry minister, has long been in the cross hairs of American investigators. He was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/venezuelan-minister-and-former-vice-president-tareck-zaidan-el-aissami-maddah-charged\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">indicted in March</a> in a Manhattan federal court and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/as0005.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">sanctioned two years ago</a> by the Treasury Department, accused of working with drug lords.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He and Mr. Maduro have <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/americas/maduro-tareck-el-aissami-venezuela-drug-trafficking.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">brushed away</a> the charges as part of a propaganda war engineered by the Trump administration to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/world/americas/venezuela-guaido-maduro-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">topple</a> Venezuela’s leftist government.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Venezuela’s own intelligence agency — which Mr. El Aissami once controlled — raised even more alarms about him and his family for more than a decade, putting its concerns in a dossier of documents, investigative findings and transcripts of interviews with drug traffickers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The dossier, provided to The New York Times by a former top Venezuelan intelligence official and confirmed independently by a second one, recounts testimony from informants accusing Mr. El Aissami and his father of recruiting Hezbollah members to help expand spying and drug trafficking networks in the region.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, and American officials say the group has long had a presence in South America, where it has helped launder drug money. In 2008, the Treasury Department <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/hp1036.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">sanctioned</a> a different Venezuelan diplomat, accusing him of raising money for Hezbollah and helping its members travel to the country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Mr. El Aissami and his father, Carlos Zaidan El Aissami, a Syrian immigrant who had worked with Hezbollah on return visits to his country, also pushed to bring Hezbollah into Venezuela, according to the dossier.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Informants told intelligence agents that Mr. El Aissami’s father was involved in a plan to train Hezbollah members in Venezuela, “with the aim of expanding intelligence networks throughout Latin America and at the same time working in drug trafficking,” the documents say.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. El Aissami helped the plan along, the dossier adds, by using his authority over residency permits to issue official documents to Hezbollah militants, enabling them to stay in the country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whether Hezbollah ever set up its intelligence network or drug routes in Venezuela is not addressed in the dossier. But it does assert that Hezbollah militants established themselves in the country with Mr. El Aissami’s help.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. El Aissami acted as a facilitator to the underworld in other ways as well. The documents say that his brother, Feraz, went into business with Venezuela’s most notorious drug lord, Walid Makled, and held nearly $45 million in Swiss bank accounts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. El Aissami had links to the drug lord, too, the documents say, noting that he issued large government contracts to a company tied to Mr. Makled.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And as the country headed toward economic collapse, forcing millions to flee Venezuela and its dangerous shortages of food and medicine, Mr. El Aissami became a wealthy man, the dossier says.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Using a frontman currently under sanctions by the United States, Mr. El Aissami bought an American bank, parts of a construction company, a stake in a Panamanian mall, land for a high-end resort and numerous Venezuelan real estate projects, including a “millionaire’s mansion” for his parents, according to the documents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. El Aissami did not respond to a written request for an interview, and no charges have been filed in Venezuela against him for drug trafficking or corruption.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But on March 8, the United States unsealed its indictment against Mr. El Aissami, making him the second member of Mr. Maduro’s cabinet known to be indicted on drug trafficking charges.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Néstor Reverol, the nation’s current interior minister, has also been indicted. And in 2017, two nephews of Mr. Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, were sentenced to 18 years in an American prison after trying to traffic 800 kilograms of cocaine.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The American government said Mr. El Aissami was deeply involved in the narcotics trade when it sanctioned him in 2017, freezing his assets along with those of Samark López, who was accused of being his frontman. It said Mr. El Aissami oversaw or partly owned narcotics shipments weighing more than a ton, managed an international network of businesses to help launder profits and forged an alliance with Mr. Makled, the drug trafficker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But American prosecutors never revealed the evidence in their case.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Venezuelan intelligence memos examined by The Times offer some of the most concrete details yet on how one of the country’s most powerful families built its empire, sketching out a family saga that stretched from Syria to Venezuela, from the narcotics trade to the president’s inner circle.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the trails led to a lonely road near Venezuela’s border with Brazil.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A national guard officer interviewed about a 2004 raid told prosecutors about a set of “warehouses that were in a state of decay, looking abandoned.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the site wasn’t empty. It was being used to store chemicals, including 140 metric tons of urea, a precursor substance used to make cocaine, according to the Venezuelan intelligence documents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Urea was a controlled substance in Venezuela, and the owners couldn’t initially provide licenses for the suspicious chemicals, the documents said. A police investigator told prosecutors that while the urea supposedly was meant to be sold as fertilizer, the explanation was suspicious because there was no agriculture in the region.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And then there was the owner of the chemicals: Mr. Makled, the drug trafficker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The bust was the beginning of the end for the Venezuelan drug lord, who is wanted for extradition by the United States. The Drug Enforcement Administration began building cases against him for running drugs with the aid of top officials. Mr. Makled was captured six years later and sentenced in 2015 to a 14-year sentence in Venezuela for drug trafficking and money laundering.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But seemingly overlooked was the other man at the center of the case: Haisam Alaisami, another relative of Mr. El Aissami, who told prosecutors he was the legal representative for Makled Investments, Mr. Makled’s company. Two people familiar with the family identified him as Mr. El Aissami’s first cousin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He could offer no information on who the potential buyers of the urea were, and investigators eventually referred the case to the narcotics division of Venezuela’s criminal and forensics agency on “suspicion of contraband,” according to police documents included in the intelligence dossier.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Neither Mr. Makled nor Mr. Alaisami responded to written requests for comment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Alaisami had a powerful family member in Mr. El Aissami, who was raised with him in Venezuela with other members of the clan who had arrived from Syria.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the investigation worked its way through state agencies, Mr. El Aissami’s star rose in leftist political circles. He went from being a confidant of President Hugo Chavez’s brother, to a legislator for the governing Socialist Party, to interior minister in 2008.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was that year that a company owned by the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, intervened: It wrote a letter saying it could account for the chemicals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">No charges were filed against Mr. Makled or Mr. Alaisami in the case. Prosecutors’ documents appear to show the shipment of urea was even returned to Mr. Makled, who ramped up his drug trafficking business in Venezuela and Colombia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Other branches of the El Aissami family were also looking to do business with Mr. Makled.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sometime before 2010, Mr. Makled was approached by Mr. El Aissami’s brother, Feraz, to provide a large sum of money to a Panama-based import company, according to an intelligence briefing in the dossier. The drug lord’s money was intended for the purchase of an oil tanker to be used in a contract with the state oil company.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Both El Aissami brothers seem to have been deeply involved in the business, according to the document. Feraz and a business partner were the public faces of the company, while Tareck, from his post as the nation’s interior minister, signed lucrative government deals with them, including a no-bid contract to provide supplies to Venezuela’s prison system, according to the intelligence report.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A third figure tied to the business cast additional suspicion on the import company: Mr. López, the man American officials said aided Mr. El Aissami’s drug trafficking network and served as his frontman.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The intelligence report also includes HSBC bank statements of accounts tied to Mr. El Aissami’s brother, Feraz, that totaled nearly $45 million — money it says was linked to Mr. Makled, the drug trafficker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">HSBC closed the Feraz accounts after Mr. Makled was arrested on drug trafficking charges, according to the intelligence documents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The dossier concludes with informant testimony on the family’s ties to Hezbollah, outlining the effort to recruit militants who could establish a drug and information network across Latin America.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the sources of the information was the drug lord, Mr. Makled, who described Mr. El Aissami’s involvement in the scheme, according to the intelligence memo.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was not the only time Mr. El Aissami had been accused of aiding Hezbollah and Mr. Makled. American — and some Venezuelan — officials have made similar allegations, though Mr. El Aissami has denied involvement with militant groups in the past, even after news <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2017/02/10/investigacion-pasaportes-en-la-sombra-llega-al-senado-de-estados-unidos/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">media reports</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Venezuelan intelligence officials believed they had evidence to the contrary. The dossier ends with references to photographs of people who “belong with the aforementioned terrorist group.”</p>',\n",

People in central and south central Kansas should expect to endure highs of about 102 degrees; the temperature in Des Moines was expected to hover around 100.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Excessive heat warnings</a> have also been posted farther east, for parts of New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">All told, at least 15 million people across the United States are currently being warned of dangerously high temperatures that could affect human health between Wednesday and Friday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the weekend, what meteorologists are calling a “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/heat-dome.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">heat dome</a>” in the middle part of the country is expected to spread into the Great Lakes and the East Coast. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The combination of heat and humidity can take its toll on someone who is outside and overdoing it,” said Richard Bann, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center. “It can be life-threatening.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last year, 108 people died from extreme heat, compared to just 30 who died from cold, according to statistics on weather-related fatalities released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here are four safety recommendations from the National Weather Service:</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">Drink plenty of fluids. </strong> </p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">Stay in an air-conditioned room.</strong> </p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">Stay out of the sun.</strong></p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">Check on relatives and neighbors</strong>, especially the elderly. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So far, Philadelphia is the only major city on the East Coast under an excessive heat warning. Meteorologists are predicting highs there of 100 degrees. But New York, Washington and Boston are expected to be uncomfortably hot, with temperatures soaring into the high 90s and above; Chicago can expect the same.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Saturday’s expected highs are 97 in Boston, 100 in Washington and 98 in New York. Chicago is expected to see a high of 97 degrees on Friday and 94 on Saturday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Gentry Trotter, the founder of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://heatupstlouis.org/category/cool-down-st-louis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Cool Down St. Louis</a>, a nonprofit that provides utility assistance for low-income families and donates air-conditioners to people who are elderly or have disabilities, said that the organization has assisted in more than 1,900 emergency situations over the past three weeks, and received 63 percent more requests this year than it did last year.<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It has just been brutal,” he said. “Yesterday we went in a home of an 80-year-old lady, and the heat almost knocked us over.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Heat warnings have Iowa farmers worrying about their corn, after planting was delayed by a soggy spring that has not left the plants much time to take root.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Despite the scorching heat, Democratic candidates for president have continued to crisscross the state.

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is expected to attend an AARP forum in Sioux City.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But ordinary people are shuffling everything from church picnics to sporting activities.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Steven Rogers, director of operations for Eastern Iowa Elite, a middle-school football club, said that two football practices have already been canceled and the team tryouts this coming Saturday have been moved indoors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You can’t really expect the kids to perform at the highest level if they are outside in this heat, beyond the fact that it’s totally dangerous,” he said. “There have been a couple of kids having some pretty bad health issues related to heat and overexertion. It’s just not safe.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hot weather is nothing new, of course, especially in July. <!-- -->But climate change is making heat <!-- -->waves like this one more common. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The meteorological ingredients that make heat waves today are the same ingredients that made them in the past, but climate change is bringing those ingredients together more often, generally speaking,” said Deke Arndt, chief of the climate monitoring branch of the National Centers for Environmental Information.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>2018 <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/climate/us-climate-report.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">National Climate Assessment, a major scientific report by </a>from 13 federal agencies, notes that while the peak of extreme heat in the United States occurred during the 1930s Dust Bowl, the number of hot days is increasing, and the frequency of heat waves in the United States jumped from an average of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/national-climate-assessment-team-updates-key-indicators-global\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">two per year in the 1960s to six per year by the 2010s</a>.

It was designed by men, for men.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Not deliberately for men, perhaps, but women were not allowed in the astronaut program until the late 1970s, and none flew until Sally Ride became the first American woman in space, in 1983. By this point, the space program was built around male bodies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If we do not acknowledge the gender bias of the early space program, it becomes difficult to move past it. One of the most compelling things about NASA is its approach to failure. Failure is not penalized in its culture; it is valued for the things that it can teach to save lives or resources in the future. As Bobak Ferdowsi, a systems engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has said, “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/drewtarvin/status/1136912645095927808\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">our best mistakes are the ones we can learn from</a>.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What are the lessons to be learned from NASA’s failure to fly women during the Apollo era?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The most recent lesson emerged in April, when NASA had scheduled a spacewalk that was, quite by accident, staffed by two female astronauts. The agency had to restaff the spacewalk because it had only one spacesuit that was the correct size for both women.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This is not an indictment of NASA in 2019. But it does demonstrate a causal chain that begins with the Apollo program and leads through to present-day staffing choices.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The suits, known as extravehicular mobility units, were designed more than 40 years ago, based on the designs of the Apollo missions, at a time when all astronauts were men. <!-- -->Only four of the original 18 suits are still rated for spaceflight, and all of those are on the space station.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">NASA first planned to have extra-small, small, medium, large and extra-large suits. For budget reasons, the extra-small, small and extra-large suits were cut. However, many of the male astronauts could not fit into the large suits, so the bigger size was brought back.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The smaller sizes never were.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Cady Coleman, an astronaut who has flown on two space shuttles and <!-- -->traveled to the space station<!-- -->, stands 5 feet 4 inches tall and remains the smallest person to ever do a spacewalk. While she was training in NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy Lab, she had to improvise padding to wear inside her spacesuit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Without that, smaller people would have an air bubble inside their suits that would make them spin in the lab’s pool as if a beach ball were strapped to their stomachs. It would not be a problem in space, Ms. Coleman told me. “But the N.B.L. was where people decided if you had what it takes to do a spacewalk,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And complaints? Well, no one else previously had that problem, so it must just be the person who complained. As a result, this gender bias became a mistake that we did not learn from, because the female astronauts compensated.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Inside the spacesuits, astronauts wear the liquid cooling and ventilation garment. This looks like long underwear covered with meters of tubes. It pumps water around the astronauts to cool them. Men and women wear the same style of garment despite the fact that we have different sweat patterns. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/do-women-sweat-differently-than-men/\" title=\"\">Men sweat more than comparably fit women</a>, and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22811031\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the areas where they sweat the most</a> occur in different parts of the body. In other words, <!-- -->when it comes to temperature-controlling garments, <!-- -->the needs are different for men and women.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We are already aware of this in relation to office temperatures. Temperatures are set for men, which leaves women carrying sweaters to work.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/chilly-at-work-a-decades-old-formula-may-be-to-blame.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">2015 study by Dutch researchers</a> found that indoor climate regulations were based on “an empirical thermal comfort model” developed in the 1960s. “Standard values for one of its primary variables — metabolic rate — are based on an average male, and may overestimate female metabolic rate by up to 35 percent,” they concluded.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">NASA took pride in advertising the space shuttle as being a shirt-sleeve environment. And yet, if you watch “The Dream Is Alive,” a 1985 documentary made by crews aboard the shuttles, take note of the thick wool slippers on <!-- -->Kathryn Sullivan<!-- -->’s feet.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Women are asked to compromise about seemingly small things in order to participate. Every time we do that, we carry those imprints forward into the future.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is worth looking back to the 1950s, when it seemed that women might be included in the early space program.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the 1950s, before we had put anyone into space at all, Dr. Randolph Lovelace wondered how women would fare as space travelers. He had designed the tests for the Mercury astronauts and proceeded to put 19 women through the first round of assessments. Thirteen passed. In fact, from testing the “First Lady Astronaut Trainees,” Dr. Lovelace discovered that women might be better suited to space than men.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They were smaller, which would reduce the weight of payloads. They had better cardiovascular health and lower oxygen consumption. And they tolerated higher G-forces and outperformed men on isolation and stress tests. (<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/us/jane-hart-activist-and-nearly-an-astronaut-dies-at-93.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">One of the women was a mother of eight</a>, and I imagine her looking at the tests and wondering when things would get difficult.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Despite all this, the tests were stopped. The women, later known as the Mercury 13, went to Congress to try to fight the ruling, but by then, the United States was in a moon race. Putting a woman into space was seen as a distraction, in part because the Soviet Union had already sent the first woman into space, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1963/06/17/archives/soviet-orbits-woman-astronaut-near-bykovsky-for-dual-flight-they.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Valentina Tereshkova</a>, and that was derided as being just a publicity stunt.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This decision meant that by 1962 it was confirmed policy, as one NASA official <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/stories/editorial/nasa%E2%80%99s-early-stand-women-astronauts-%E2%80%9Cno-present-plans-include-women-space-flights%E2%80%9D?xid=PS_smithsonian\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">wrote in a letter to a young girl</a> who was interested in becoming an astronaut, that “we have no present plans to employ women on spaceflights because of the degree of scientific and flight training, and the physical characteristics, which are required.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The gender bias in this statement is, to a modern reader, unmistakable.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During project Mercury, astronauts did not need scientific training — they simply needed a bachelor’s degree or equivalent. John Glenn did not even have a degree.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And the flight training — what did this mean, exactly? For project Mercury, astronauts needed to be a graduate of test pilot school, with a minimum of 1,500 hours flying time, and a qualified jet pilot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The requirement to be a test pilot was a logical choice, not so much because of the nerves of steel required to fly experimental aircraft, but because test pilots are trained to take notes while piloting and to deliver clear reports afterward. But this criterion eliminated female pilots, because the only qualified test pilot schools were military and they did not accept women.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mind you, during World War II, the Women Airforce Service Pilots were responsible for training pilots and towing planes for live-ammunition practice, as well as for ferrying and testing aircraft. In many cases, these women logged more flight hours than their male counterparts. They did not, however, have a certificate from a test pilot school.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Kari Love, a former spacesuit designer, once told me that “while we can look back and understand why women were an afterthought in aerospace to this point, we are at serious risk for that to be reproduced as we move into the commercial spaceflight era.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Without conscious thought, the design of the ship and the lunar platform for the Artemis missions is likely to reproduce design choices made in the Apollo era when astronauts were all men.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ladder rungs are set at the optimum distance for the average man. The pistol-grip tool, or cordless drill, is sized for a man’s hand. The distance from the seats to the control panels in SpaceX’s Dragon Crew capsule is being tested and optimized for an all-male crew.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then there are the questions that we cannot answer simply because we have too little data. Since 1961, when Yuri Gagarin became the first man in space, over 500 people have been in space and only 64 of them have been women. We know that astronauts receive more radiation in space. Studies on Earth show that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.passblue.com/2017/07/05/females-exposed-to-nuclear-radiation-are-far-likelier-than-males-to-suffer-harm/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">radiation can affect women</a> at a rate 10 times higher than men. How will that play out in space?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As we look back at the Apollo mission and forward to Artemis, it is important to examine the gender biases of the early space program for lessons learned. If we want to land the first woman on the moon, let’s make sure she has tools designed with her in mind. Eliminating the legacy of gender bias is just one small step.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">____</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://maryrobinettekowal.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Mary Robinette Kowal</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">, a Hugo Award winner, is the author of “The Glamourist Histories” series, “Ghost Talkers” and the “Lady Astronaut” duology.

That’s because they think it’s about more than just soccer. They think America rewards excellence. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And the<!-- -->n they’ll grow up<!-- --> and<!-- --> learn that if they want to be<!-- --> like their heroes, they’ll have to fight every step of the way. Because for women, even world championships don’t guarantee equality. That’s why we have to keep the pr<!-- -->essure on. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We know this because we’ve been here before. Like most of the current U.S. national tea<!-- -->m, I was a <!-- -->kid<!-- --> when I first saw that iconic photo of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/sports/soccer/brandi-chastain-womens-world-cup-image.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Brandi Chastain</a> in 1999, ecstatic from scoring the winning goal for the United States in the Women’s World Cup. It was on the cover of every news magazine <!-- -->I encountered,<!-- --> including the Newsweek that arrived at my home that summer. The cover read “Girls Rule!” (Nevermind that Ms. Chastain was a 30-something working woman.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The photo was exciting. It showed a woman who<!-- --> <!-- -->had<!-- --> l<!-- -->ost control. She had torn off her shirt and skidded to he<!-- -->r knees in euphoria in her sports bra. She looked joyous and strong and reckless. She looked so cool. I grabbed the issue and took it straight to my room to read the article, which explained in breathless terms that the moment was surely a turning point for women athletes. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Just like the images of this year’s triumphant World Cup team, that photo of Ms. Chastain’s celebration achieved what it was meant to do: It inspired girls like me. But in retrospect, it’s also kind of sad. We didn’t know how rare those images were going to be.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now those girls who taped that picture of Ms. Chastain to our bedroom walls <!-- -->are grown-ups. <!-- -->We became managers, doctors, journalists, just as we were told we could. Some of us even became Olympians. And we’re still fighting the same fights.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The United States women’s soccer team has become an excruciating example of a scenario we’ve seen play out for decades: Little girls are told to follow their dreams, and to excel, until they become women and expect be paid for it. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Twenty-eight national team players sued the United States Soccer Federation in March, claiming it pays them less, provides unequal playing conditions and does not promote their games as much as it does those of the men’s team. <!-- -->If both teams played and won the same number of “friendly” matches in a year, according to the lawsuit, the women would earn, at most, $99,000. The men, $263,320 on average.<!-- --> </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the score hovered at a draw in the World Cup final last Sunday, I couldn’t forget that if the American women didn’t win, it would probably undercut the discussion around their push for equal pay. Even though that would make them second in the world, and after they won the last tournament in 2015. (The last time the American men won a medal in the World Cup it was 1930.) To get what they deserve, the women need to be perfect. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Maybe that’s part of why the team ran up scores like 13-0 during this World Cup; they need a narrative of <!-- -->dominance<!-- --> in order to make their case to get paid the same as men who aren’t even on the same level.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And they<!-- --> won while having every quote, every <!-- -->celebratory gesture<!-- --> scrutinized by the public and the president alike. Americans who didn’t like how Alex Morgan sipped tea or how Megan Rapinoe refused to sing the national anthem even rooted for them to lose. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Of course, there are reasons the men’s team makes more money; there always are. But one of the more intractable excuses is that the world thinks of men’s sports, <!-- -->like many men’s ventures,<!-- --> as profitable businesses worth investing in. Women’s sports are relegated to inspiration. Why else would the United States women’s team, composed of working adults, have the unfathomably patronizing slogan “Dare to Shine”? </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Money makes money — women can play and win all they want. (Provided we are grateful for the opportunity.) But the system is created by men, for men. We pay for what we value. And if we invest in women’s soccer as though there won’t be an audience, we’ll make that come true. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today, 40 percent of all athletes are female — inspired by role models like Brandi Chastain, as this team was. But they receive only 4 percent of media cov<!-- -->erag<!-- -->e. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since 2000, the <!-- -->only female athlete <!-- -->to achieve the distinction of Sports Illustrated’s athlete of the year has been Serena W<!-- -->illiams<!-- -->. She’s also chronically the only woman on the list of the world’s 100 top-paid athletes — one of the best athletes of all time, right there this year at No. 63. Of course, even <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a28209579/serena-williams-us-open-2018-essay/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">she had to fight</a> hard for what she’s earned. And rewarding a best-in-history woman in a sea of men is not equality. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At a press conference after the Wimbledon final on Saturday, a female reporter had the gall to ask Serena Williams how she would respond to the criticism that she should stop fighting for equality and just focus on tennis. “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YpnDBQyi_g\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">The day I stop fighting for equality</a> and for people that look like you and me,” she said, “will be the day I’m in my grave.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After all these years, I still admire Brandi Chastain. I played soccer as I grew up and became a competitive distance runner. That photo of her is timeless; it has stayed with me far longer than that World Cup game.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That’s partly because there wasn’t the predicted flood of famous female athletes, in soccer or otherwise, to take its place. It remains disappointingly remarkable to see a woman celebrated for her athletic achievements (at least, when it comes to celebrating what her body can do, as opposed to what it can look like).</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The photos of Megan Rapinoe and her victory pose also are likely to stand out to the girls looking on for decades. But I hope the images <!-- -->endure<!-- --> for showing that this time, things changed. </p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">Lindsay Crouse (<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/lindsaycrouse\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">@lindsaycrouse</a>) is a senior staff editor for Op-Docs.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> to the editor.

       " 'yankees-domingo-german': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To become the Yankees’ most improved pitcher this season, and a bulwark in their unsteady starting rotation, Domingo German got technical help from the most obvious authority, the team’s pitching coach. For the bigger picture, though, when he needed personal and professional mentoring, German turned to an unusual source — a once-promising pitcher who struggled immensely in his own major league career.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">German could have easily sought help through the large network of baseball stars from the Dominican Republic, his home country, including the Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez, who is known for dispensing wisdom to young pitchers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Instead German contacted Daniel Cabrera, a virtual stranger now working for a real estate company in the Dominican. The two had never met or spoken before, even though they came from the same municipality, San Pedro de Macorís, a hotbed of baseball talent. Their relationship started last summer with an Instagram direct message.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There are a ton of other people, like Pedro and other former pitchers, and people much closer to him than me,” Cabrera, 38, said in Spanish in a telephone interview. “But that’s why I say it was a work of God. He was put in my path.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A right-hander like German, Cabrera pitched from 2004 to 2009, mostly with the Baltimore Orioles. He had a<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cabreda01.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> career 5.10 earned run average</a> and walked a lot of batters, yet he kept getting opportunities because of the tantalizing potential in his 6-foot-7 frame and his high-90s fastball.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But it was the failures that made Cabrera seem like an ideal choice to guide the cheerful, soft-spoken German. As he struggled through a rough 2018 season, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/germado01.shtml\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">ultimately posting a 5.57 E.R.A.</a>, German sent Cabrera a message.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">German, 26, had been meaning to reach out to Cabrera for some time. There were several things about Cabrera that stood out to German, from the trajectory of his career to the family photographs that filled his Instagram page.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He and I have the same personality and the same way of living,” said German, who is set to start the first game of the Yankees’ doubleheader against the Rays on Thursday after Wednesday night’s game was rained out.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Soon the two exchanged phone numbers and began talking frequently, German requesting counsel, something he said he had never sought out before like that.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Cabrera told German that he saw glimpses of Martinez in him. He told German that he had tons of talent but needed to make sure his focus was on baseball. He also told German that he needed to ramp up his aggressiveness on the mound, a trait Cabrera lacked when he pitched.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More than anything, Cabrera told German about his failures.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If I could redo my career, I would have left many things behind,” Cabrera said. “Things that had nothing to do with baseball. My career could have been different. I told him: ‘Don’t let what happened to me happen to you. I wish I could’ve found someone back then to tell me what I’m telling you now.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Because he came from humble beginnings, Cabrera said, he enjoyed life in the major leagues too much. After a poor performance, he tried to forget about it by going out and having fun — ignoring advice from his brothers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The real workhorse pitchers, when they have a bad game, they’re at the field first thing, working so that the next game doesn’t go the same way,” Cabrera said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Cabrera said German was different because he was willing to follow the counsel of an elder. So when German asked Cabrera this year about helping him find an apartment to buy in the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo, Cabrera told German to wait.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I bought an apartment on the beach when I was having a good season,” Cabrera said. “So when I was playing, I thought a lot, ‘Man, how great would it be to be in the Dominican at my apartment?’ So my mind was on the Dominican when it should have been on baseball.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">German and Cabrera still talk weekly. Cabrera has watched German’s starts from afar and offered tips, and as German fixed his delivery over the winter, he sent video of the changes to Cabrera. They have also discussed the pain in German’s left hip, which turned out to be <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/sports/yankees-indians-domingo-german.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a strained hip flexor that led to a month</a> on the injured list.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He’s not a person who will get into a long discussion to tell me something,” German said. “He says it short and direct, and it’s helpful. If he does something, he does it for love. He does it because he really wanted to help someone.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the biggest factors in German’s breakout season has been an improved curveball. Over the off-season, he and Larry Rothschild, the Yankees’ longtime pitching coach, met at the team’s spring training facility in Tampa, Fla., to go over video.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They noticed that two critical elements of German’s pitching mechanics had changed from 2017, when he made a promising major league debut, to 2018. First, German’s lead arm was dropping too much in his delivery, which affected the angle of his body and his command. Second, his back leg was bent more, and his command had been better when the leg was straighter.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The results in 2019: German has an 11-2 record and 3.40 E.R.A., which is the best on the team. Opponents are hitting .142 and whiffing 48 percent of the time they swing at his curveball, according to Baseball Savant, making his curve one of the most difficult to hit in the majors. Rothschild said German’s confidence had grown as the season progressed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m very satisfied with myself and those that have helped me,” German said early this season.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although German has proved invaluable to the Yankees in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/30/sports/luis-severino-yankees-injuries.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the absence of the ace Luis Severino</a> and the inconsistencies of other starters like James Paxton, C.\\u2009C. Sabathia and J.A. Happ, his role could change. The Yankees are targeting <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/sports/baseball/yankees-pitching.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">pitching upgrades ahead of the July 31 trade deadline</a>, and if they acquire another starter, German could end up in the bullpen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">German went into this season expecting an innings limit of some sort. He has never thrown more than 124 in a season, and he logged only 94 last year between the major and minor leagues. He has already pitched 86 innings this season, including four during a rehabilitation assignment in the minors. For young pitchers, a substantial workload increase is viewed as potentially harmful.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If it looks like he’s getting tired and different things, you want to prevent an injury, not react to it,” Rothschild said last month.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If German stays in the rotation, he might not get far past his previous career high in innings anyway, because of the injury. Should the Yankees acquire another starting pitcher, German could be an option as a hard thrower in the bullpen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He keeps very much earning himself that spot” in the rotation, Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said last week after German’s 11th win.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“But we also feel like with Domingo, no matter what our team is like moving forward, depending how much volume he gets to, he can fill so many pretty exciting roles for us — whether it’s as a starter or a guy that can give you multiple innings in a key spot out of the bullpen or a high leverage spot late — you feel good handing him the ball. So right now, he’s in a really good place.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">German has said all the right things about any uncertainty surrounding his role. “Wherever they put me in the game, I’ll do my job and help the team,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And no matter what happens, German will have his mentor a phone call away. Cabrera once pitched out of the bullpen.</p>',\n",
