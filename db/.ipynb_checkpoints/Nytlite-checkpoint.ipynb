Whether judged according to merit or family ties, immigrants are <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/family-diversity-immigrants-are-far-better-educated-us-born-americans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">already better educated</a> than their native-born counterparts. So if Mr. Trump wants to shift the debate to skills, liberals should take him up on his offer.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Unlike his previous proposals, this one would not reduce the total number of immigrants allowed in. This might feel like a minor victory, but it drastically undercuts the far-right fantasy of shutting America\\\\u2019s borders. No wonder reactionaries like Ann Coulter <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnCoulter/status/1129102821012459520\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">see this as a sellout</a>. White nationalists in particular see high-skilled immigrants as the greatest threat. What could be scarier to a white supremacist than thousands of immigrants who are better educated and more employable than he is? </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">By proposing no immigration cuts, Mr. Trump has conceded the fundamental liberal premise that America needs immigrants. It is only a question of which immigrants are selected, and how.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Of course, there is plenty to despise in the plan: the construction of a border wall, the silence on the fate of the Dreamers. Democrats must fight tooth and nail on these policies and propose more humane enforcement of immigration laws. But on the core premise of preferring highly skilled immigrants, Mr. Trump has a point.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The trap for liberals is that we\\\\u2019ll overreact to what is essentially a moderate proposal. This would let Mr. Trump slap his name on the \\\\u201cmerit-based\\\\u201d argument, one that most Americans would find reasonable. Mr. Trump would then own the center of the debate and be able to cast anyone to his left as too extreme. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Liberals would have to explain why they don\\\\u2019t like highly skilled immigrants and would end up looking confused, while conservatives would get to play the role of mature border enforcers. Millions of migrants would be caught in the middle. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Finally, an outright rejection by liberals would give Mr. Trump cover for more reactionary or extreme immigration measures down the line.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump has cited my country, Canada, as a model for this kind of plan, and it\\\\u2019s true: Immigration has worked in Canada. Unlike in the United States, a vast majority of immigrants to Canada are evaluated on their skills and qualifications and whether those match the needs of the labor market. </p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">It\\\\u2019s an imperfect system \\\\u2014 what policy isn\\\\u2019t? \\\\u2014 but it is the reason Canadians are broadly content that their country has one of the highest rates of immigration in the world. The success of the merit-based system also permits the government to have the generous refugee and humanitarian policies that it does.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">My father migrated to Canada from Pakistan in the 1970s, under the first Prime Minister Trudeau. Like many immigrants, he walked in the snow to his first job and never lost the feeling that he was incredibly privileged to be living there. Whatever \\\\u201cmerit\\\\u201d he may have possessed, it was the immigrant ethos of tenacity, discipline and resourcefulness that really mattered. One of the lessons he imparted to his children was that the law had allowed us to be here and we must always respect that law.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><div class=\"css-z3e15g\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper-hidden\"></div><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-children\"><figure aria-label=\"media\" class=\"css-jcw7oy e1g7ppur0\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/opinion/17Aziz/merlin_71856655_a079bf21-c471-4419-9d17-ce094b4f5d86-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" role=\"group\"><div class=\"css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Image</span><img alt=\"\" class=\"css-1m50asq\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/opinion/17Aziz/merlin_71856655_a079bf21-c471-4419-9d17-ce094b4f5d86-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" itemprop=\"url\" sizes=\"((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/opinion/17Aziz/merlin_71856655_a079bf21-c471-4419-9d17-ce094b4f5d86-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/opinion/17Aziz/merlin_71856655_a079bf21-c471-4419-9d17-ce094b4f5d86-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/opinion/17Aziz/merlin_71856655_a079bf21-c471-4419-9d17-ce094b4f5d86-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/opinion/17Aziz/merlin_71856655_a079bf21-c471-4419-9d17-ce094b4f5d86-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w\"/></div><figcaption class=\"css-1l44abu e1xdpqjp0\" itemprop=\"caption description\"><span class=\"css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0\">Sajith Abeyawickrama, an anesthesiologist in his native Sri Lanka, immigrated to the United States in 2010.\\\\xa0He was teaching medical exam prep in Newark in 2013.\\\\xa0</span><span class=\"css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Credit</span><span>Karsten Moran for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Canada\\\\u2019s success story is now under threat, as it faces its own migration crisis fueled by thousands of undocumented migrants <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/statistics/Pages/Irregular-border-crosser-statistics.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">crossing over from America</a>.

I have heard Canadians of Hungarian, West Indian and Pakistani origin all express frustration that more recent arrivals have jumped the line. Part of this is the very human tendency of immigrants to pull up the drawbridge after they have crossed over. Part of it is a sincere belief that the integrity of the system that brought them here should not be corrupted.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">In the United States, the vicious cycle of unlawful migration and heightened xenophobia has been going on for decades. It\\\\u2019s what led to Mr. Trump\\\\u2019s election in 2016, and if Democrats cannot propose reasonable alternatives on immigration, they will lose again. No amount of multicultural sloganeering will assuage Americans\\\\u2019 concerns that the system is broken.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Liberals will have to propose a workable path to citizenship for the roughly 20 million undocumented migrants in the United States. They will have to propose reforms to the ruthless immigration enforcement regime that puts children into cages. Immigration courts, understaffed and with large backlogs of pending cases, will have to be funded. And liberals must keep fighting every inch of Mr. Trump\\\\u2019s border wall. </p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">At the same time, the left would be wise to reset this toxic debate by agreeing to focus on highly skilled immigrants. Every immigration policy is bound to penalize and offend some people while rewarding others. But reframing the conversation in terms of merit calls Mr. Trump\\\\u2019s bluff. <!-- -->It turns the immigration issue into an argument that liberals can win. <!-- -->It combines compassion with common sense, which is what Americans on both the left and the right want.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">America is not just a country; it\\\\u2019s a world. What the United States has achieved as a continental, multiracial, constitutional democracy of around 330 million diverse citizens is unprecedented in world history. It is easy to forget just how recent \\\\u2014 and how radical \\\\u2014 this social experiment is, and how fragile it has become. Preserving the idea of America as a nation of immigrants requires more than just compassion. It requires persuasion. </p><p class=\"css-176h8r7 etfikam0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/omeraziz12\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Omer Aziz</a> is the author of the forthcoming \\\\u201cBrown Boy: A Story of Race, Religion, and Inheritance.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-176h8r7 etfikam0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> to the editor.

His trade war has hurt many of the farmers who make up his political base, and he is eager to make good on a 2016 campaign promise to rewrite trade deals in America\\\\u2019s favor.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cI\\\\u2019m pleased to announce we\\\\u2019ve just reached agreement with Canada and Mexico. We\\\\u2019ll be selling our product into those countries without the imposition of tariffs,\\\\u201d Mr. Trump said on Friday.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The United States trade representative said in a statement that the metal tariffs would be removed and both Mexico and Canada \\\\u201chad agreed on the removal of all retaliatory tariffs imposed on American goods by those countries.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The easing of trade tensions in North America could give Mr. Trump more leeway as he pursues an ambitious trade fight with China, which has imposed tariffs on American products in retaliation for the president\\\\u2019s levies on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods. Mr. Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping restrictions against Chinese telecom companies like Huawei, and he has threatened to tax all Chinese imports, prompting concerns from farmers and other businesses caught in the cross-fire.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">On Friday, it became clear that pressure to reach an accord with Canada and Mexico before the 2020 elections outweighed the president\\\\u2019s affection for the steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed last year.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The metal tariffs are linked to a broader free trade agreement, the newly negotiated Nafta, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mr. Trump had described the tariffs as a source of leverage in negotiating a revision to that deal, which has yet to be ratified by legislatures in all three countries.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But both Republicans and Democrats had said they would not sign off on that deal until the White House removed metal tariffs on Canada and Mexico. They argue that the levies are raising costs for American companies and consumers, and that Canadian and Mexican retaliation is hurting American farmers and businesses.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">A congressional aide who has been involved in the talks between the three countries said the White House was growing increasingly sensitive to pressure from Republicans in rural states whose farmers have been suffering from reprisal that diminished their access to sell in neighboring markets. Their problems were compounded when talks with China broke down this month, this person said.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Vice President Mike Pence, who has spent weeks traversing Midwestern states to sell the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in Congress, relayed the complaints of manufacturers and farmers hurt by the tariffs to Mr. Trump, telling him, \\\\u201cWe\\\\u2019ve got to get moving on this.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">While rescinding the metal tariffs will remove one important obstacle to the passage of the trade deal, others remain. House Democrats have insisted that the pact include more labor and environmental protections.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, is in no particular rush to give the president a major domestic policy victory in 2020, according to people familiar with her views.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Jes\\\\xfas Seade, the under secretary for North America at Mexico\\\\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said that he hoped that ending the dispute would give \\\\u201can extra push\\\\u201d toward ratifying the agreement. Mexico will lift its retaliatory tariffs in a couple of days, he said.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Speaking from Stelco, a steel producer in Hamilton, Ontario, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said on Friday that the deal was \\\\u201cpure good news\\\\u201d and would help clear the way for the passage of the agreement. \\\\u201cWe are very optimistic we will be able to move forward in coming weeks,\\\\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">As the White House eased tensions with Canada and Mexico on Friday, it continued to pressure allies elsewhere, including Europe and Japan. Those governments are still not exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs, and they are likely to bear the brunt of auto tariffs that could reach 25 percent, should Mr. Trump opt to impose them.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The White House\\\\u2019s <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/politics/trump-auto-tariffs-delay.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">announcement Friday of a delay</a> in determining whether to impose levies on foreign automobiles delivered a temporary reprieve to global automakers and auto suppliers, which had been bracing for punishing tariffs on millions of cars imported into the United States each year. But it also set up a tense six-month period for the White House to reach trade deals with Japan, Europe and other nations that have already been complicated by mistrust and disagreements.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">In a proclamation Monday, Mr. Trump said that imports of foreign cars and car parts were causing harm to the American automobile industry and threatening national security and that other countries had 180 days to address the problem through trade agreements with the United States.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">If agreements \\\\u201cto address the national security threat\\\\u201d are not reached, Mr. Trump said he would determine \\\\u201cwhether and what further action needs to be taken,\\\\u201d a step that could include imposing 25 percent tariffs on foreign cars.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Car companies and industry groups said that a delay did not go far enough and that Mr. Trump should abandon any plan to impose car tariffs.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cThe continued threat of tariffs on cars and auto parts only creates more uncertainty weakening our economy,\\\\u201d said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Many outside the administration have criticized the linkage of cars with national security, pointing out that the bulk of American auto imports come from the country\\\\u2019s closest allies.

A Brooklyn-born activist once arrested in a civil rights protest, Mr. Sanders had mounted several quixotic election campaigns in Vermont before finally winning the mayoral race by a 10-vote margin with a message about close-to-home issues like property taxes.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">He initially seemed determined to govern in much the same way.

In the summer of 1981, he wrote to the mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, reflecting with remorse <!-- -->on<!-- --> the atomic bombings there. In September, he invited the then-first lady of France, Danielle Mitterrand, to visit Burlington, introducing himself in a letter as the head of a \\\\u201cstruggling socialist municipal government\\\\u201d and appealing to her as a \\\\u201cfellow socialist.\\\\u201d (Ms. Mitterrand politely declined.)</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">And Mr. Sanders took a pleading tone in a letter that October to Mr. Reagan, and to government leaders in France, Britain, China and the Soviet Union, urging them to shift their spending \\\\u201cnow being wasted on weaponry to the development of goods and services which fulfill human needs.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But soon, Mr. Sanders grew more confrontational, loudly aligning himself \\\\u2014 and, he hoped, his city \\\\u2014 against Mr. Reagan\\\\u2019s policies. In February of 1982, Mr. Sanders addressed hundreds of demonstrators at City Hall, calling for the United States to shun the dictatorship in El Salvador, and he backed a ballot initiative later that year stating Burlington\\\\u2019s opposition to American involvement in the country.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">A pamphlet for Mr. Sanders\\\\u2019s side in the plebiscite urged <!-- -->citizens<!-- -->: \\\\u201cYour Vote Can Help Stop Another Vietnam!\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The referendum passed with three-quarters of the vote, which Mr. Sanders noted in a tart letter to Mr. Reagan.

Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, won independence for India by basing itself on the equal and inclusive participation of all citizens as constituents of the nation.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">This approach was challenged in the 1920s by two specific and at that time relatively minor forms of nationalism: the Muslim League, a party established by Muslim landowners and the educated middle class, which claimed to represent Muslim nationalism; and the Hindu Mahasabha, created by upper-caste, middle-class Hindus, which asserted that it represented Hindu nationalism. It later morphed into the Rashtriya Svayamsevak Sangh, also known as the R.S.S. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The Muslim League spearheaded <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/opinion/india-muslims-hindus-partition.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the creation of Pakistan</a> in 1947. The R.S.S. and its affiliates are still waiting to convert India from a secular democracy into a Hindu religious state. Their ideology, which attempts to legitimize the politics of Hindu majoritarianism, goes by the name of Hindutva (Hindu-ness).</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Both Muslim and Hindu nationalisms were rooted in Britain\\\\u2019s colonial understanding of India.

Both these theories, initially accepted by Indians, were later questioned by historians and discarded half a century ago. However, they remain the bedrock of Hindutva.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">To establish a Hindu state, democracy has to be replaced by a state where the fact of Hindus being in a majority in itself gives them priority. The Hindutva definition of the Hindu is that both his ancestral homeland and the Hindu religion\\\\u2019s place of origin are within the boundaries of British India. This makes the Hindu distinctly different from those that came from elsewhere, as well as from those of other religions \\\\u2014 Christians, Muslims and Parsis are therefore aliens.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The origin of the Hindus is traced back to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3520116?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Aryan culture</a>. Aryan identifies a language and a culture, not a biological race, whose emergence historians date to the second millennium B.C.

Historians see this as evidence of migrations into India, but the idea is anathema to the Hindutva construction of early history.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">To assert that the pre-Islamic period of Indian history was a golden age, claims are repeatedly made that this \\\\u201cHindu period\\\\u201d from 1000 B.C. to 1200 A.D. was so scientifically advanced that Hindus were already using many modern scientific inventions, such as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/02/hindu-nationalists-claim-ancient-indians-had-airplanes-stem-cell-technology-and\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">airplanes, plastic surgery and stem-cell research</a>. These statements are applied to the activities of gods and men from the ancient past.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The other equally insistent Hindutva argument is that the Hindus were victimized by the Muslims and were slaves for the thousand years of Muslim rule. In demanding a Hindu Rashtra, or Hindu state, they claim to be asserting their historical rights and avenging their victimization. The history of the \\\\u201cMuslim period,\\\\u201d the second millennium A.D., is seen solely from this perspective and remains a mechanism for fueling hatred.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Historians find no evidence for such sweeping generalizations, but their views are dismissed. There certainly were conflicts between Hindus and Muslims, just as there had been conflicts between Hindus and Buddhists in pre-Islamic times. Some powerful Muslims did attack Hindu temples, both to loot their riches and to direct aggression against the religion. But this again was known in pre-Islamic times when some Hindu kings looted and destroyed temples to acquire wealth. There was more than religious prejudice involved in such actions.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The claim to victimization is ironic given that the worst form of victimization \\\\u2014 declaring the lower castes to be so polluted as to be untouchable \\\\u2014 was practiced by upper-caste Hindus for 2,000 years, including through the period when they were supposedly being victimized.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">It is striking that remarkable new ideas surfaced in Hinduism during the period of Muslim rule, such as those developed by its many devotional sects, which enriched the religion and gave it a form that is currently observed by some Hindu devotees. But these are treated as isolated incidents. Nor is there reference to some of the most exquisite religious poems in praise of Hindu gods that were composed by Muslim poets, and that continue to be sung in repertoires of classical music. That the higher administrative offices of this period were manned largely by Hindu upper castes is conveniently ignored.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">In contemporary India the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/sunday-times/deep-focus/The-Nehru-you-dont-know/articleshow/52273186.cms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">concerted attacks on Jawaharlal Nehru</a>, the country\\\\u2019s first prime minister and a symbol of the anticolonial movement who understood the centrality of secularism in Indian society, is a covert way of attacking secular democracy. The antipathy and the effort to diminish the achievements of Mr. Nehru also stem from the R.S.S. not being part of India\\\\u2019s anticolonial struggle.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The most dangerous aspect of the implanting of the Hindutva version of history across Indian society is that the divide between professional history and the version of the past used to legitimize Hindu majoritarianism is increasing. The latter has the patronage of the government, is well financed, and is popularized in a variety of ways. Those critical of this Hindutva history are already being labeled anti-national in an attempt to subvert historical research.</p><p class=\"css-176h8r7 etfikam0\">Romila Thapar is a historian and the author of \\\\u201cThe Past as Present: Forging Contemporary Identities Through History.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-176h8r7 etfikam0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> to the editor.

There is no person or group or sect or party or mob that doesn\\\\u2019t want power, convinced that it would know how to use it as no one ever has before.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">I\\\\u2019m no different. And yet I\\\\u2019ve always been afraid of having authority assigned to me. Whether it was at school or at work, men were in the majority in any governing body and the women adopted male ways. I never felt at ease, so I stayed on the sidelines. I was sure that I didn\\\\u2019t have the strength to sustain conflicts with men, and that I would betray myself by adapting my views to theirs. For millenniums, every expression of power has been conditioned by male attitudes toward the world. To women, then, it seems that power can be used only in the ways that men have traditionally used it.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">There is one<!-- --> form of power that has fascinated me ever since I was a girl, even though it has been widely colonized by men: the power of storytelling. Telling stories really is a kind of power, and not an insignificant one. Stories give shape to experience, sometimes by accommodating traditional literary forms, sometimes by turning them upside down, sometimes by reorganizing them. Stories draw readers into their web, and engage them by putting them to work, body and soul, <!-- -->so that they can<!-- --> transform the black thread of writing into people, ideas, feelings, actions, cities, worlds, humanity, life. Storytelling, in other words, gives us the power to bring order to the chaos of the real<!-- --> under our own sign<!-- -->, and in this it isn\\\\u2019t very far from political power.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">In the beginning I didn\\\\u2019t know that storytelling was a kind of power. I became aware of this only slowly, and felt an often paralyzing responsibility. I still do. Power is neither good nor bad \\\\u2014 it depends on what we intend to do with it. The older I get, the more afraid I am of using the power of storytelling badly. My intentions in general are good, but sometimes telling a story succeeds in the right way and sometimes in the wrong way. The only consolation I have is that however badly conceived and badly written \\\\u2014 and therefore harmful \\\\u2014 a story may be, the harm will always be less than that caused by terrible political and economic mismanagement, with its accouterments of wars, guillotines, mass exterminations, ghettos, concentration camps and gulags.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">What to say, then? I suppose that I chose to write out of a fear of handling more concrete and dangerous forms of power. And also perhaps out of a strong feeling of alienation from the techniques of domination, so that at times writing seemed to be the most congenial way for me to react to abuses of power.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><div class=\"css-z3e15g\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper-hidden\"></div><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-children\"><figure aria-label=\"media\" class=\"css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/16/opinion/16power2/merlin_154842402_52cbdc56-8f9a-4e1d-92c7-2f9f155244aa-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" role=\"group\"><div class=\"css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Image</span><img alt=\"\" class=\"css-1m50asq\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/16/opinion/16power2/merlin_154842402_52cbdc56-8f9a-4e1d-92c7-2f9f155244aa-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" itemprop=\"url\" sizes=\"((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 80vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/16/opinion/16power2/merlin_154842402_52cbdc56-8f9a-4e1d-92c7-2f9f155244aa-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/16/opinion/16power2/merlin_154842402_52cbdc56-8f9a-4e1d-92c7-2f9f155244aa-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/16/opinion/16power2/merlin_154842402_52cbdc56-8f9a-4e1d-92c7-2f9f155244aa-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/16/opinion/16power2/merlin_154842402_52cbdc56-8f9a-4e1d-92c7-2f9f155244aa-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w\"/></div><figcaption class=\"css-18crmh6 e1xdpqjp0\" itemprop=\"caption description\"><span class=\"css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Credit</span><span>Maddie McGarvey for The New York Times</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">However, I chose to write mainly because, as a girl, I mistakenly thought that literature was particularly welcoming to women. The \\\\u201cDecameron,\\\\u201d by Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375), made a great impression on me. In this work, which is at the origin of the grand Italian and European narrative traditions, 10 youths \\\\u2014 seven women and three men \\\\u2014 take turns telling stories for 10 days. At around the age of 16, I found it reassuring that Boccaccio, in conceiving his narrators, had made most of them women. Here was a great writer, the father of the modern story, presenting seven great female narrators. There was something to hope for.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Only later did I discover that even though in the fiction of the \\\\u201cDecameron\\\\u201d Boccaccio had been generous toward women, in the real world things were very different \\\\u2014 and continue to be. We women have been pushed to the margins, toward subservience, even when it comes to our literary work. <!-- -->It\\\\u2019s a fact:<!-- --> Libraries and archives of every sort preserve the thought and actions of a disproportionate number of prominent men. To construct instead a potent genealogy of our own, a female genealogy, would be a delicate and arduous task.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">If things had turned out differently, would we have done any better than men? Are we, ultimately, better than they are? As a young woman I thought so, but today I don\\\\u2019t know. </p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">I tend to avoid any idealization. It\\\\u2019s not good for our cause, in my view, to imagine that all women are honorable, good-natured, extremely smart, fearless and blameless, and, above all, no longer the accomplices of men. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Our widespread complicity is in fact a serious problem. Power is still firmly in male hands, and if, in societies with solid democratic traditions, we are more frequently given access to positions of command, it is only on condition that we show that we have internalized the male method of confronting and resolving problems. As a result, we too often end up demonstrating that we are acquiescent, obedient and equal to male expectations.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-g92qtk epkadsg3\"><div class=\"css-1owp1gq epkadsg0\">THE BIG IDEAS: WHAT IS POWER?</div><div class=\"css-ckpga5 epkadsg1\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">This is a special section of The Times\\\\u2019s philosophy series, </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-stone?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">The Stone</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">, in which more than a dozen notable thinkers and writers answer the question, \\\\u201cWhat is power?\\\\u201d</em></div><div class=\"css-15g2oxy epkadsg2\"><div class=\"css-2b3w4o e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/opinion/propaganda-is-power.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-bqoegj e16ij5yr5\">Opinion | Jason Stanley and David Beaver</div><div class=\"css-1hma5rr e16ij5yr2\">Beware of \\\\u2018Snakes,\\\\u2019 \\\\u2018Invaders\\\\u2019 and Other Fighting Words</div><time class=\"css-rqb9bm e16638kd0\" datetime=\"2019-05-16\">May 16, 2019</time></div><div class=\"css-rxyfbr e16ij5yr0\"><img class=\"css-32rbo2 e16ij5yr1\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/opinion/16powerNew/16powerNew-threeByTwoSmallAt2X.jpg\"/></div></a></div><div class=\"css-2b3w4o e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/opinion/power-in-words.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-bqoegj e16ij5yr5\">Opinion | N.

Our summers last seven months, and we get two weeks of spring if we\\\\u2019re lucky. As it happens, Tuesday was one of those rare spring days; outside the Statehouse there was a breeze. But inside, up in the gallery, where religious leaders sat beside protesters, where out-of-town journalists mixed with anxious Alabamians, and glass windows separated the governed from those doing the governing, it was sweltering.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Twenty-five men voted that night to pass the most restrictive abortion ban in the country, following a debate that lasted nearly five hours. During the deliberations, the atmosphere in the gallery was raucous, almost rowdy: Half the crowd stood and cheered when a Democratic senator, Vivian Figures, who was one of three women on the Senate floor that night, walked into the chamber clad in suffragist white. The same half laughed and booed when a Republican senator, Clyde Chambliss, stumbled through the details of the female reproductive system.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But when the vote itself finally came, it was abrupt, even anticlimactic. The bill passed; senators unceremoniously exited their chamber, greeting each other with handshakes and fist bumps; I took off my press pass and went back to being a woman who lives in Alabama. I choked back tears as I tried to push past the crowd.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Women in Alabama are not a monolith. For all that the national coverage has focused on the male legislators who passed the bill, it\\\\u2019s worth noting that the state Republican Party is led by a woman; the abortion ban bill was sponsored by a woman \\\\u2014 one who I believe thinks in her heart of hearts that she is doing the right thing by her faith \\\\u2014 and it was signed into law by a woman, Gov. Kay Ivey. There is a gap between how men and women view abortion in Alabama, but it isn\\\\u2019t huge: <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/state/alabama/views-about-abortion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">According to Pew Research Center</a>, in 2014, of Alabamians who believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases, 53 percent were women, and 47 percent were men.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But there were also many women protesting the bill in Birmingham this week, dressed in doctors scrubs and \\\\u201cHandmaid\\\\u2019s Tale\\\\u201d costumes, carrying coat hangers and forcing us to remember. And just two weeks ago the world mourned, alongside us, <!-- -->the death <!-- -->of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/us/rachel-held-evans.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Rachel Held Evans</a>, an Alabama native who helped ignite a resurgence of progressive Christianity and made us question closely held beliefs,<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong>including about <!-- -->abortion, which she opposed, but felt conflicted on.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The women of Alabama are not a monolith, but there are forces at work determining which ones get to shape policy and which don\\\\u2019t. According to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://womensfundbirmingham.org/assets/2019/05/TWF_CTP_2019_INTERACTIVE.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">research from the Women\\\\u2019s Fund of Greater Birmingham</a>, 48.5 percent of single female-headed households are below the national poverty line. Alabama is one of two states <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.aauw.org/resource/state-equal-pay-laws/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">without equal-pay laws</a>, despite our own Lilly Ledbetter, for whom the 2009 Fair Pay Act is named, paving the way nationally. Racial disparities in both economic and health outcomes still loom large: African-American women here <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/29/alabama-cervical-cancer-black-women-human-rights-watch-report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">contract cervical cancer</a> at almost twice the rate of white women.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Alabama has always been an easy state to pick on. We appear regularly on lists of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/23/the-10-most-and-least-educated-states-in-2018.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">least-educated states</a>. Just this week, U.S. News &amp; World Report ranked Alabama <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/alabama\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the worst state to live</a> in save Louisiana. It\\\\u2019s also a state with a blood-red supermajority, one that has kept our voter turnout rates low and our apathy high for decades.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">I myself got the heck out of Alabama after I graduated from college, not because I hated it, but because I wanted more.<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong>I moved to New York City, fulfilling the trope with which so many from the South are familiar. I wanted to make my mark in a bigger pond, find adventure, cuss more. I think I did all three.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But then Alabama pulled me back. It was 2017: A Democrat, Doug Jones, was up for a Senate seat against Roy Moore, who at first, looked like a shoo-in. Then the reports started coming. The courage of the women who spoke out against his abuse while they were teenagers was a catalyst for a trickle, though not a flood, of Alabama women\\\\u2019s #MeToo stories. When Mr. Jones won, backed by women, black women in particular,<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong>I started to have a sense that, just maybe, Alabamians had the power to decide our own fate \\\\u2014 that the blood-red supermajority didn\\\\u2019t have to be all-powerful after all.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">So my husband and I decided to move back home. New York was too expensive anyway, and I missed my mom.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">I came back to a state that felt in the grip of change. In November 2018 more than 50 women, mostly Democrats, ran for state level office. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But then most of these women lost, save for just a handful: Ms. Ivey, a Republican who beat out the mayor of Tuscaloosa, Walt Maddox, to remain governor \\\\u2014 she\\\\u2019d taken office after her predecessor resigned in a sex scandal \\\\u2014 and two other House incumbents among them. That same election, 59 percent of Alabamians voted to add an amendment to the state Constitution declaring Alabama a pro-life state, should Roe v. Wade be overturned. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">It wasn\\\\u2019t exactly clear what that would entail at the time. But it became a little clearer this week, when the abortion ban marched forward with what felt like inevitability, and once again seemed to send the message: The supermajority always wins.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But at times like these, it\\\\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that it doesn\\\\u2019t have to. Women across Alabama ran for state level office by the dozens and lost in 2018. But during that same election, in Jefferson County, the same county where four black girls were killed by Ku Klux Klan bombs 56 years ago, nine black women were elected judges.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Alabama changed half a century ago because black and white activists from around the country poured into the state to work alongside homegrown leaders and activists, many of them women, to force change. That\\\\u2019s how cities like New York and San Francisco have changed too \\\\u2014 a critical mass of people coming to a place and working, sometimes even dying, to make it better. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">So if you care about places like Alabama, if you care about women in places like Alabama, the solution isn\\\\u2019t a boycott or a mocking tweet. It\\\\u2019s pretty simple. Y\\\\u2019all come on down here and work with us to make a difference. Just bring sunscreen and a fan. This summer\\\\u2019s going to be hot.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-g92qtk epkadsg3\"><div class=\"css-1owp1gq epkadsg0\">Related</div><div class=\"css-15g2oxy epkadsg2\"><div class=\"css-2b3w4o e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/opinion/alabama-abortion-supreme-court.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-bqoegj e16ij5yr5\">Opinion | Mary Ziegler</div><div class=\"css-1hma5rr e16ij5yr2\">Abortion Opponents Think They\\\\u2019re Winning.

Their problems were compounded when talks with China broke down this month, this person said, and ultimately Mr. Trump decided that he needed a victory on trade.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The decision to ease the 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum came as the White House <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/politics/trump-auto-tariffs-delay.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage\" title=\"\">also announced a six-month delay</a> in determining whether to impose levies on foreign automobiles. That extension delivers a temporary reprieve to global automakers and auto suppliers, which had been bracing for punishing tariffs of up to 25 percent. But it sets up a tight deadline for the president and his advisers to reach trade deals with Japan, Europe and potentially other countries.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Farmers, ranchers and business groups had been pushing to lift the metal tariffs, to encourage Canada and Mexico to remove the tariffs they have placed on American products in return. Canadian and Mexican levies on products like pork, cheese and milk have especially hurt American farmers who are already smarting from Mr. Trump\\\\u2019s trade conflicts with China and Europe.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The agreement is likely to help the administration focus on the other trade fights it is waging, most notably fractious negotiations with China, which nearly collapsed last week. And it will remove one obstacle to the passage of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement in Congress.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The United States, Canada and Mexico signed that trade deal, the successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, in November. The pact still needs to be ratified by legislatures in all three countries.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">American lawmakers of both parties, as well as Canada and Mexico, had insisted that tariffs on steel and aluminum must be lifted before votes would be held. Lawmakers have argued that the tariffs, while aimed at other countries, hurt American companies and consumers by raising prices for products that use imported steel and aluminum.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Even with an agreement to resolve metal tariffs, the North American pact still faces potential opposition from congressional Democrats. They have criticized its labor and environmental protections as insufficiently weak, and said that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/nafta-drug-prices.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">its protections for drug companies</a> may undermine their efforts to make health care more affordable.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Canada, like Mexico, has repeatedly said it would not ratify the new North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Trump considers one of his signature economic achievements, unless the metal tariffs were lifted. Canada has argued that the tariffs undermined both countries\\\\u2019 economies and were particularly counterproductive given the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement reached last year.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cCertainly, for the ratification of the U.S.M.C.A., it\\\\u2019s a step forward,\\\\u201d said Patrick Leblond, a senior fellow at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a think tank.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">In its announcement on Friday, Canada said that the two countries would set up measures to block imports of metals that are unfairly subsidized or sold at below-market prices. In the event of a surge in imported products, the countries would carry out consultations, and if those were not successful, the governments could impose a tariff on the individual product of 25 percent for steel and 10 percent for aluminum, it said.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">After Mr. Trump imposed the metals tariffs last June, the move drew anger, bemusement and disappointment in the metals industry and across the political spectrum in Canada. Canadians were irate that Mr. Trump appeared intent on punishing Canada, a major trading partner and traditionally one of its most ardent allies. Backed by all three of Canada\\\\u2019s three major political parties, the Canadian government retaliated with import duties on $12.6 billion of American products, including ballpoint pens and industrial pipes.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The White House\\\\u2019s justification of the tariffs by citing national security drew particular scorn in Canada, where many were already reeling from Mr. Trump\\\\u2019s bullying and mocking of Mr. Trudeau and his trade policies. Some called for boycotts of American products and avoiding taking vacations in the United States.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The American tariffs were particularly punishing to Canada because it buys more American steel than any other country, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/controls-controles/steel_alum-acier_alum.aspx?lang=eng\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">according to the Canadian government</a>, while <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.rbc.com/economics/economic-reports/pdf/other-reports/SandATarrifs_May2018.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">nearly 90 percent of Canadian steel and aluminum exports go to the United States</a>. In 2017, the Canadian steel industry employed more than 23,000 Canadians and the aluminum industry about 10,500 workers. After the imposition of the duties, some economists predicted it could cost the Canadian economy more than $3 billion Canadian dollars annually.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div></section>]', 'link': '/2019/05/17/business/tariffs-metals-canada-mexico.html', 'title': '<title data-rh=\"true\">United States Reaches Deal to Lift Metal Tariffs on Canada and Mexico - The New York Times</title>'}, 'alabama-abortion-law': {'body': '[<section class=\"meteredContent css-1i2y565\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" name=\"articleBody\"><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Kay Ivey, Alabama\\\\u2019s Republican governor, this week signed some of the most restrictive abortion legislation this country has seen in decades into law.

If men or conservative legislators were actually held accountable for the safety, financial security and futures of the unwanted children in whose interest they are supposedly passing anti-abortion laws, perhaps they might reconsider these draconian measures. \\\\u2014 <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://nyti.ms/2Jkpnf3#permid=100500225\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Elisabeth MTR, Connecticut</em></a></p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">I just read a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://share.qz.com/news/2440621/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=daily-brief\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">related piece</a> on how the new laws in Alabama and Georgia are going to have an impact on men.

The issue is whether a simple medical decision by a rational person is one that is trumped by one who is not.<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> \\\\u2014 </strong><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://nyti.ms/2W4zz1j#permid=100505887\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Maxine and Max, Brooklyn</em></a></p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1wm5y40 epkadsg3\"><div class=\"css-13ft82o epkadsg0\">More reactions to Alabama\\\\u2019s new abortion legislation</div><div class=\"css-15g2oxy epkadsg2\"><div class=\"css-4q4vfu e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/opinion/alabama-abortion-georgia-roe.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-ekih7a e16ij5yr2\">Opinion | Michelle Goldberg: Post-Roe America Won\\\\u2019t Be Like Pre-Roe America.

In particular, the Trump administration perceives those rules as forcing the transfer of foreign technology to Chinese companies, unfairly <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-us-has-capitulated-to-china-2019-02-25\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">helping them.</a></p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But even American negotiators who parse the trade versus tech issue this clearly tend to overlook an essential fact: The international trade and financial system that was set up after World War II \\\\u2014 with the creation of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and, much later, the World Trade Organization (all nurtured and dominated by the United States) \\\\u2014 actively encouraged \\\\u201c<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.oecd.org/investment/investmentfordevelopment/1959815.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">technological spillovers</a>\\\\u201d from developed economies to developing ones.

But China did much better than achieve self-sustaining growth.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">By the late 2000s, it had come to seem too successful, and a threat: The West was struggling then with a major financial crisis (largely of its own doing). Today, the longstanding principle that knowledge transfers are good all-around is being questioned. Do they continue to serve the global interest and should they still be encouraged \\\\u2014 even when it comes to China? Or should China be treated as an exception? It is in a class of its own, by dint of both its size and the state\\\\u2019s involvement in its economy.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">American negotiators have <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1987/8729/8729.PDF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">long complained</a> that China\\\\u2019s foreign investment practices are unfair.

Chinese companies are developing electric vehicles with <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/10/business/china-electric-cars.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">support from Renault-Nissan and Ford</a>.

Outright theft also has sometimes occurred, including in the defense sector, of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/opinion/china-us-intellectual-property-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">information about bombers and missile systems</a>.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But to say all these things in the same breath is to risk conflating inadequate rules with violations of existing rules that may be adequate, and government policy with the behavior of private actors. Officials in the Trump administration suggest <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/china-trump-cyberespionage.html%3E%3E?module=inline\" title=\"\">that China\\\\u2019s foreign-investment requirements themselves amount to theft</a>. In many instances, however, technology is being transferred between companies in the context <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/us/politics/china-trump-cyberespionage.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">of consensual, negotiated business agreements</a>.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Also, violations or near-violations are par for the course during certain stages of a country\\\\u2019s development. That fact doesn\\\\u2019t make them acceptable, but it offers useful context for thinking through how best to react to them. Other rapidly growing economies, including Japan and South Korea in the 1980s, were also accused of unfairly securing technology from foreign partners (or subsidizing their exports). But as those countries\\\\u2019 incomes rose and their own capacity to innovate developed, they started complying with the rules \\\\u2014 typically when per capita income reached $25,000.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">China, at its current growth rates, is more than a decade away from achieving that income level. And yet it has already made more progress than is usually acknowledged toward protecting intellectual property rights. AmCham China\\\\u2019s <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/au/Documents/international-specialist/deloitte-amcham-2019-china-business-climate-survey-report-bilingual-190301.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">2019 China Business Climate Survey Report</a> noted that 59 percent of the more than 300 American companies it interviewed said that China\\\\u2019s enforcement of intellectual property rights had improved over the last five years; 37 percent said it had stayed the same. (China is growing up in other respects, too. Both <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/2168079/imf-chief-lagarde-dismisses-idea-beijing-manipulating-yuan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the I.M.F.</a> and the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/2168203/us-treasury-staff-finds-china-not-manipulating-yuan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">United States Treasury</a> have recently determined that the Chinese government is not manipulating its currency. And its <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/china/current-account-to-gdp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">current account surpluses</a> have virtually evaporated.)</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">That said, penalties for, say, infringing patents remain weak in China and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca4b76e2-5645-11e9-91f9-b6515a54c5b1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">enforcement is lax</a>. The National People\\\\u2019s Congress passed <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/knowledge/publications/a885f4c3/china-overhauls-its-foreign-investment-regulatory-regime\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a foreign-investment law</a> in March, but it offered too little on implementation.

Students with large financial aid packages are finding their nontuition assistance for items such as room and board taxed by as much as 37 percent, even if their family income tax rates are much lower.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The impact on full-time undergraduate and graduate students under the age of 24 went largely unnoticed until the waning weeks of tax season. But word is spreading. About 1.3 million undergraduate students and 15,000 graduate students have scholarships and grant aid that cover nontuition expenses.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, a Washington trade group representing 1,700 college and university presidents, wrote to Democratic and Republican leaders of the tax-writing House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees, urging them to \\\\u201cswiftly correct a mistake.\\\\u201d</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Mr. Mitchell wrote that the portion of college scholarships subject to the tax is usually awarded to students from families of little means. Among those students are college athletes awarded full scholarships, many of whom come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. \\\\u201cNow, these students are being taxed at the same rates as wealthy individuals,\\\\u201d Mr. Mitchell wrote.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The so-called kiddie tax rate was established specifically to address generational transfers used by rich parents to lower their tax burdens, but in the name of tax-code simplification, the Republican tax law expanded its reach.

Bush. It forces children to pay taxes on both earned income \\\\u2014 like salaries from summer jobs \\\\u2014 and unearned income, like stock dividends and nontuition scholarships.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The different types of income have different rates, and until the Trump tax overhaul passed, the rate for unearned income was tied to how much a child\\\\u2019s parents earned. That meant scholarship winners from low-income families, whose parents had little or no federal income tax liability, also faced low tax rates.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The 2017 law evolved quickly as it sped through the House and the Senate. Almost from the start in the House, it included the change to kiddie tax rates for unearned income. When the Ways and Means Committee approved the tax-cut bill for a vote of the full House, Republicans <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/115th-congress/house-report/409/1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22kiddie%22%5D%7D&amp;s=8&amp;r=2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">included a report</a> that said the bill \\\\u201csimplifies the \\\\u2018kiddie tax\\\\u2019 by effectively applying the rates applicable to trusts.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">While the change increased tax bills for some groups, it also effectively capped the amount of taxes for wealthy individuals.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The language was maintained in the Senate version of the bill, as well as the final agreement that Mr. Trump signed in December 2017.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Republicans now say they did not anticipate that it would raise taxes on low-income scholarship winners.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Jesse A. Solis, a spokesman for the Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee, said that the 2017 tax law had achieved a long-sought goal of simplifying the tax code.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cWhen we first discovered that changes made to how unearned income for students is taxed was having unintended consequences on some college scholarships, we quickly went to work on solutions,\\\\u201d Mr. Solis said. \\\\u201cDiscussions with the majority are ongoing, and we are hopeful that bipartisan action can be taken soon to provide greater certainty for students and their families.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, is working with his colleagues in the Senate and the House to address this issue as quickly as possible, according to a committee spokesman.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cHistorically, after major tax legislation, the longstanding practice has been to correct drafting errors and other technical issues on a bipartisan basis,\\\\u201d Mr. Grassley said after reports of the Gold Star family tax increase came to light.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Democrats have expressed openness to fixing some other problems caused by the law, including harm to restaurant owners seeking to remodel their establishments. But after unanimously opposing the law, they are likely to demand a price for getting Republicans out of a political jam. Any fix would need to roll back some provisions of the law, Democrats say.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The new tax structure imposes a range of levies on unearned income: 10 percent on amounts up to $2,550, 24 percent on unearned income over $2,550, 35 percent on amounts over $9,150 and 37 percent on amounts over $12,500. According to the College Board, the average cost of room and board in the 2018-19 school year at a four-year public university is $11,140, and $12,680 at a private four-year school.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">In the past, a student from a household with a joint income of $50,000 who was awarded a scholarship that covered $11,500 in room and board would be taxed at their parents\\\\u2019 rate of 12 percent. Under the new law, that money would be taxed up to 35 percent.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s one of those things that is under the radar now but could really have a big impact,\\\\u201d said Megan McClean Coval, the vice president for policy and federal relations at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, student aid officials said they had begun examining specific aid packages amid concerns about how the tax could affect its most needy students, said Rachelle Feldman, the university\\\\u2019s associate provost and director of scholarships and student aid.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">About 14 percent of the university\\\\u2019s undergraduate class is part of a program called the Carolina Covenant, which provides debt-free, full financial aid packages to students who fall below 200 percent of the federal poverty level.

That vicious, baseless caricature demonized some of the nation\\\\u2019s most vulnerable people, laying the groundwork for bipartisan welfare reforms that slashed direct aid to the poor. And the Taylor-inspired trope continues to haunt our political conversation, as elected officials claim that aid programs are plagued by fraud and call for food stamp recipients to be banned from purchasing \\\\u201cluxury\\\\u201d items like lobster.

At the height of her infamy in the mid-1970s, Taylor wasn\\\\u2019t just depicted as a brazen thief. She was seen as a shape-shifter, a woman who used dozens of aliases and her own racial ambiguity to abet her scams. \\\\u201cHer skin is sallow \\\\u2014 like a medium yellow \\\\u2014 and she has no features that make her peculiar to any racial background,\\\\u201d a detective explained in one national news item about Taylor. \\\\u201cSo she passes as a Filipino. She puts on a black wig and becomes a Negro, and with other makeup and wigs, she passes for white.\\\\u201d Another article said that Taylor, who in the 1970s self-identified as black, was able to pass for \\\\u201cSpanish, Filipino, [and] white.\\\\u201d</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">As I researched Taylor\\\\u2019s life decades later, I discovered that much of what had been said about her was inaccurate, misleading, or worse. Taylor, who died in obscurity in 2002, hadn\\\\u2019t actually pilfered $150,000 in welfare money in a single year. Her take was estimated at $40,000 over many years, and she was officially charged with stealing around $9,000. And welfare fraud, it turned out, was the least of her crimes. Taylor was a known kidnapper, and in the 1970s and 1980s, three people she\\\\u2019d become close to ended up dead under suspicious circumstances. Those disturbing incidents were never adequately investigated. The press, politicians, and government officials saw Taylor as the country\\\\u2019s biggest welfare cheat. Nothing else she\\\\u2019d done, no matter how heinous, could overpower that image.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">At least one part of the Linda Taylor legend was true: She had no fixed identity, and she changed her name and appearance constantly. Taylor had picked up that habit from an early age. As a child in the Deep South, the color of her skin had marked her as a target, someone whose very existence was seen as a shameful mistake.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Taylor\\\\u2019s mother, Lydia Mooney, was white, and her family came from Cullman County, Ala., an area where white separatism was official policy. In 1908, a pair of small newspapers reported that the county seat was \\\\u201cthe only strictly white town in North Alabama, if not in the entire state.\\\\u201d In the 1930s, a black newspaper in Virginia wrote that black \\\\u201cmotorists buy all the gasoline their cars can hold in order not to have to stop at Cullman for any purpose.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Lydia left her home in Alabama when she was 17. Her husband, who she\\\\u2019d married when she was 14, later filed for divorce, accusing her of infidelity. Lydia\\\\u2019s daughter Martha \\\\u2014 the future Linda Taylor \\\\u2014 was born in 1926, in a tiny town on the banks of Mississippi River called Golddust, Tenn. While no county or state record was issued to mark the child\\\\u2019s arrival, Lydia\\\\u2019s family whispered that the child had been the product of an affair, and that the father was a black man.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">I don\\\\u2019t know if Taylor ever met her father or knew her father\\\\u2019s family. I did learn that her parentage made her a nonperson in the eyes of many of her white relatives. One of her mother\\\\u2019s brothers refused to let Taylor set foot inside his home. A first cousin also remembered seeing Taylor sitting in a car, alone, during a big family gathering \\\\u2014 none of her relatives spoke to her, and she didn\\\\u2019t speak to any of them.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Taylor wasn\\\\u2019t just denied feelings of kinship and family connections. She was deprived of an education. In a court hearing in the 1960s, Taylor\\\\u2019s aunt would testify that her niece \\\\u201cdidn\\\\u2019t go to no school I went to.\\\\u201d Taylor\\\\u2019s older sister Mary Jane, who had two white parents, did have the opportunity to spend time in a classroom.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">While Taylor\\\\u2019s family didn\\\\u2019t let her forget her heritage, they did their best to obscure it publicly. Not long after Taylor was born, her mother and her stepfather, J.J. Miller, moved to Mississippi County, Ark., to find work planting and picking cotton. In both 1930 and 1940, Taylor was marked as white on the census, just like the rest of the Millers. This government-adjudged racial purity affirmed that the Millers were law-abiding citizens. Arkansas law at the time banned the \\\\u201ccohabitation of persons of the Caucasian race and of the Negro race, whether open or secret.\\\\u201d According to a state statute, \\\\u201cAny woman who shall have been delivered of a mulatto child, the same shall be prima facie evidence of guilt without further proof and shall justify a conviction of the woman.\\\\u201d If Taylor had been declared a \\\\u201cNegro,\\\\u201d her mother would have been guilty of a felony.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">When she became a young adult, Taylor traveled the same road as millions of other black Americans, leaving the South for a locale that was reputedly more equitable. Taylor landed in the Bay Area during the World War II shipbuilding boom. But while California was often depicted as a place full of opportunity and relatively free of prejudice, the reality often didn\\\\u2019t live up to that dreamy vision. Taylor found herself in a rat-infested apartment building in West Oakland. She was arrested multiple times in the mid-1940s for prostitution-related offenses.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">In California, as in Arkansas, Taylor hid her racial identity. In March 1948 \\\\u2014 six months before the Supreme Court of California declared the state\\\\u2019s miscegenation ban unconstitutional \\\\u2014 she married a man with German ancestry. Their marriage license identified Taylor as Hawaiian, a fiction that allowed her to account for the color of her skin while still conforming to the government\\\\u2019s parameters for whiteness.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">That marriage wouldn\\\\u2019t last, nor would her stint in California. She eventually moved to Chicago, managing to blend in for a time while living in the predominantly white neighborhood of Lincoln Park. But in 1964, Taylor chose to pursue an outlandish, risky gambit, claiming that she was the daughter of a black gambling kingpin and the rightful heir to his substantial fortune. Taylor didn\\\\u2019t assume this new identity all that skillfully. The documents she presented to affirm her heirship were clear forgeries. More painfully, her white relatives came from Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Texas to tell a probate court judge that Taylor was a liar.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Linda Taylor\\\\u2019s family was motivated less by a burning desire to tell the truth than an impulse to bury an uncomfortable secret. Taylor\\\\u2019s uncle claimed improbably that her father was Portuguese. Taylor\\\\u2019s mother also denied that she\\\\u2019d given birth to her own daughter, testifying that the child had been left on her doorstep as a 3-month-old infant.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">That was a laughable story. It was also a pitiable one, confirmation that Taylor had never been wanted. The judge in that heirship case ruled, correctly, that Taylor had no claim on the gambling kingpin\\\\u2019s estate. At that point, one of her sons told me, Taylor decided that she was done with white people \\\\u2014 that they\\\\u2019d done nothing but abandon and abuse her. Taylor left Lincoln Park and moved to a part of Chicago\\\\u2019s South Side that was essentially all black. That\\\\u2019s where she was living in the 1970s, when she was christened the welfare queen.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Linda Taylor was inarguably a villain. She had no regard for other people, and she preyed on most everyone she met, including her own children. It doesn\\\\u2019t excuse her crimes to acknowledge that she was also a victim, and she was victimized because of her race. It\\\\u2019s impossible to understand her life without understanding where she came from, a place and time where the line between black and white could not be smudged.

This week on \\\\u201cThe Argument,\\\\u201d Ross Douthat argues that President Trump\\\\u2019s trade war is a reasonable response to the country\\\\u2019s economically aggressive, increasingly authoritarian behavior. Michelle Goldberg says poor execution and the abandonment of liberal-democratic values are hobbling the administration\\\\u2019s China hawkishness.

places where they all intersect. I\\\\u2019m a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I\\\\u2019m against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the \\\\u201creasonable\\\\u201d elites. I\\\\u2019ve written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis; I\\\\u2019m working on one about decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows.

I\\\\u2019ve written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian \\\\xe9migr\\\\xe9 who helped bring yoga to the West.)

I caught the journalism bug a very long time ago \\\\u2014 first as a little kid in the late 1970s who loved reading the Boston Globe sports section and later as a teenager working on my high school and college newspapers. I discovered that when my classmates and I put a complaint in print, for everyone to see, school administrators actually paid attention. I\\\\u2019ve since worked as a metro reporter at The Washington Post and a writer at BusinessWeek magazine. At The Times, I started as a reporter in the business section and have also been a Times Magazine staff writer, the Washington bureau chief and the founding editor of The Upshot.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">My politics are left of center. But I\\\\u2019m also to the right of many Times readers. I think education reform has accomplished a lot. I think two-parent families are good for society. I think progressives should be realistic about the cultural conservatism that dominates much of this country. Most of all, however, I worry deeply about today\\\\u2019s Republican Party, which has become dangerously extreme. This country faces some huge challenges \\\\u2014 inequality, climate change, the rise of China \\\\u2014 and they\\\\u2019ll be very hard to solve without having both parties committed to the basic functioning of American democracy.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-g92qtk epkadsg3\"><div class=\"css-1owp1gq epkadsg0\">RELATED </div><div class=\"css-ckpga5 epkadsg1\">More from Opinion on U.S.-China relations and the American labor movement:</div><div class=\"css-15g2oxy epkadsg2\"><div class=\"css-2b3w4o e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/opinion/xi-trump-trade-war-china-leadership.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-bqoegj e16ij5yr5\">Opinion | Yi-Zheng Lian</div><div class=\"css-1hma5rr e16ij5yr2\">Xi Jinping Wanted Global Dominance.

It follows a measure that Georgia\\\\u2019s governor signed earlier this month effectively banning most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy and that is worded in a way that could lead to prosecutions of women who terminate their pregnancies after that point. Missouri\\\\u2019s legislature approved an eight-week abortion ban on Friday, also without exceptions for rape or incest. It contains a trigger that will ban abortion outright if Roe v. Wade falls. A Louisiana six-week abortion ban is likely to be next.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">You can see, in the anti-abortion movement, a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/05/alabama-and-georgia-are-throwing-down-the-gauntlet-against-roe-good-2/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">mood of triumphant anticipation</a>. Decades of right-wing politics have all led up to this moment, when an anti-abortion majority on the Supreme Court could end women\\\\u2019s constitutional protection against being forced to carry a pregnancy and give birth against their will. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">An end to Roe isn\\\\u2019t guaranteed \\\\u2014 some court watchers expect Chief Justice John Roberts to allow it to be whittled away rather than overturned. But activists on both sides of the abortion divide agree that the precedent has never been more vulnerable.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Feminists sometimes say, of threats to legal abortion, \\\\u201c<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1087909943267729408\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">We won\\\\u2019t go back</a>.\\\\u201d But it\\\\u2019s important to understand that we\\\\u2019re not necessarily facing a return to the past. The new wave of anti-abortion laws suggests that a post-Roe America won\\\\u2019t look like the country did before 1973, when the court case was decided. It will probably be worse.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nytimes.com/theargument?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Listen to \\\\u201cThe Argument\\\\u201d podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">True, in a post-Roe America, some women would be able to get abortion-inducing medications that weren\\\\u2019t available the last time abortion was criminalized. (Misoprostol, which is also used to treat ulcers, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/opinion/spreading-plan-c-to-end-pregnancy.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">can be ordered online</a>.) But today\\\\u2019s legal context has been transformed by decades of anti-abortion activism equating abortion with murder, as well as by mass incarceration. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">While doctors were prosecuted for abortions before Roe, patients rarely were. Today, in states that have legislated fetal personhood, women are already arrested on suspicion of harming or endangering their fetuses, including by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/when-the-womb-is-a-crime-scene\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">using drugs</a>, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/28/opinion/abortion-murder-charge.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">attempting suicide</a> or, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/08/us/plea-agreement-for-mother-in-baby-s-death.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">in a case in Utah</a>, delaying a cesarean section. There\\\\u2019s no reason to believe that, in states where abortion is considered homicide, prosecutors will be less punitive when investigating it.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Further, the abortion bans in the new wave are harsher than most of those that existed before Roe. At that time, most states prohibited abortion in most circumstances, but according to the historian Leslie Reagan, author of the book \\\\u201cWhen Abortion Was a Crime,\\\\u201d there was little legal conception of fetal personhood. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">It was generally up to doctors, Reagan told me, to determine what constituted a \\\\u201cmedically justifiable\\\\u201d exemption to abortion bans. \\\\u201cThe legal loophole provided a space in which doctors and women could negotiate and allowed physicians to perform abortions in the privacy of their own offices or homes,\\\\u201d she wrote in her book.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">By contrast, the new laws seek to curtail medical discretion. Under the Alabama measure, doctors can perform abortions only when a woman is facing death or \\\\u201cserious risk of substantial physical impairment of a major bodily function.\\\\u201d Otherwise, abortion is a Class A felony, and Reagan said the potential 99-year prison sentence it carries is far longer than any punishment a doctor could have faced in pre-Roe America.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The text of the Alabama law explicitly likens abortion to a crime against humanity. More \\\\u201cthan 50 million babies have been aborted in the United States since the Roe decision in 1973, more than three times the number who were killed in German death camps, Chinese purges, Stalin\\\\u2019s gulags, Cambodian killing fields, and the Rwandan genocide combined,\\\\u201d it says. Surely this is a signal to prosecutors to treat it as an extraordinarily grave transgression.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">At least the Alabama law exempts people having abortions from prosecution. But they are not spared by the Georgia law, which, as Mark Joseph Stern <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/hb481-georgia-abortion-ban-criminal-brian-kemp-horrific.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">points out in Slate</a>, has language that criminalizes self-induced abortion. Nor are women who abort exempt from punishment in the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1131516\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">most recent version</a> of Louisiana\\\\u2019s six-week abortion ban. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Republican politicians in other states are clearly interested in locking women up; last month, Texas legislators <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/04/10/texas-bill-would-make-it-possible-put-women-death-having-abortions/?utm_term=.470ef64cbefa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">held a hearing</a> on a bill that would allow women who have abortions to be charged with homicide and potentially subject to the death penalty. In a post-Roe future, the political fight, at least in red states, could shift from whether women can have abortions to whether they can be imprisoned for them.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">None of this should whitewash the horrors and indignities that women in America endured before Roe. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2003/03/lessons-roe-will-past-be-prologue\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">According to the Guttmacher Institute</a>, there were almost 200 reported deaths from illegal abortion just in 1965, 17 percent of all deaths from pregnancy and childbirth that year. Each year thousands of women were hospitalized for botched abortions. And while women were rarely incarcerated for aborting, they were regularly threatened with prosecution to get them to testify against providers. America was a repressive place for women, without even the pretext of legal equality.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Still, a lesson of fundamentalist regimes worldwide is that when reactionaries try to enforce their ideas about gender traditionalism, they can be more tyrannical than real tradition ever was. Granting personhood to fetuses has already enabled some states to subject women to new types of social control; <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/when-the-womb-is-a-crime-scene\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">as ProPublica reported</a>, in 2014 a woman was arrested under Alabama\\\\u2019s \\\\u201cchemical endangerment of a child\\\\u201d statute for taking half a Valium while she was pregnant. Those who might be ambivalent about abortion should realize that these strictures can apply to them as well.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">As we watch Donald Trump remake this country in ways that once seemed unimaginable, it\\\\u2019s tempting to reach for historical analogies to grapple with what\\\\u2019s happening. It\\\\u2019s why, as people struggle to understand how his abuses of power might be constrained, there\\\\u2019s been renewed interest in Watergate. Yet, as in the comparison between Richard Nixon and Trump, the past can prove inadequate to understanding the depredations of the present. Rather than moving backward, we\\\\u2019re charting awful new frontiers.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1wm5y40 epkadsg3\"><div class=\"css-13ft82o epkadsg0\">RELATED </div><div class=\"css-1h1tbmp epkadsg1\">More from Michelle Goldberg on abortion rights:</div><div class=\"css-15g2oxy epkadsg2\"><div class=\"css-4q4vfu e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/opinion/trump-wisconsin-abortion.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-ekih7a e16ij5yr2\">Opinion | Michelle Goldberg: Trump\\\\u2019s Anti-Abortion Incitement</div><time class=\"css-rqb9bm e16638kd0\" datetime=\"2019-04-29\">April 29, 2019</time></div><div class=\"css-77hcv e16ij5yr0\"></div></a></div><div class=\"css-4q4vfu e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/opinion/abortion-heartbeat-ban-georgia.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-ekih7a e16ij5yr2\">Opinion | Michelle Goldberg: The Abortion Divide Gets Deeper</div><time class=\"css-rqb9bm e16638kd0\" datetime=\"2019-03-29\">March 29, 2019</time></div><div class=\"css-77hcv e16ij5yr0\"></div></a></div><div class=\"css-4q4vfu e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/opinion/the-argument-abortion-medicare-for-all.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-ekih7a e16ij5yr2\">Opinion: The Abortion Debate</div><time class=\"css-rqb9bm e16638kd0\" datetime=\"2019-02-07\">Feb. 7, 2019</time></div><div class=\"css-77hcv e16ij5yr0\"></div></a></div><div class=\"css-4q4vfu e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/opinion/state-of-the-union-abortion-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-ekih7a e16ij5yr2\">Opinion | Michelle Goldberg: Trump Loves a Culture War</div><time class=\"css-rqb9bm e16638kd0\" datetime=\"2019-02-06\">Feb. 6, 2019</time></div><div class=\"css-77hcv e16ij5yr0\"></div></a></div><div class=\"css-4q4vfu e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/opinion/abortion-virginia-kathy-tran.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-ekih7a e16ij5yr2\">Opinion | Michelle Goldberg: Fake News About Abortion in Virginia</div><time class=\"css-rqb9bm e16638kd0\" datetime=\"2019-02-01\">Feb. 1, 2019</time></div><div class=\"css-77hcv e16ij5yr0\"></div></a></div></div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-176h8r7 etfikam0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> to the editor.

The security of our telecommunications networks is a responsibility shared by operators, equipment vendors and service providers to collectively perform risk mitigation with assurance and transparency. Telecom operators control the network and the data moving across it, and circumventing their controls would be extremely hard, given the available risk-mitigation processes. Huawei has repeatedly said it would refuse any order to attack or spy on its customers.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Moreover, singling out Huawei because it is headquartered in China makes little <!-- -->sense<!-- -->. Telecommunications companies such as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://gbtimes.com/nokia-signs-contracts-worth-23bn-with-three-chinese-telecoms-operators\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Nokia</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/about-us/history/places/asia/china\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Ericsson</a> draw from a global supply chain, as Huawei does.

Blacklisting one company \\\\u2014 or all of the companies from one country \\\\u2014 does nothing to mitigate this global supply chain risk and will substantially reduce competition that will inevitably increase costs.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The executive order and the Commerce Department\\\\u2019s regulation aim to prevent malicious actors from inserting malware into telecommunications networks that could surreptitiously monitor network traffic or launch a cyberattack.

Strauss, had groped students, required them to strip unnecessarily during examinations, and asked intimate questions about sexual practices under the guise of providing medical treatment.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cThe findings are shocking and painful to comprehend,\\\\u201d the Ohio State president, Michael V. Drake, said in a statement.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cOur institution\\\\u2019s fundamental failure at the time to prevent this abuse was unacceptable,\\\\u201d he added, \\\\u201cas were the inadequate efforts to thoroughly investigate complaints raised by students and staff members.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The university said that college personnel knew about the accusations against Dr. Strauss, who committed suicide in 2005, as early as 1979. In fact, many former students interviewed for the report said they believed Dr. Strauss\\\\u2019s actions were an \\\\u201copen secret\\\\u201d on campus and among athletes, coaches, trainers and other team physicians. But again and again, the report made clear, those in position to take action against Dr. Strauss seemed unwilling or unable to intervene.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Some of those interviewed, for example, said there was much talk about Dr. Strauss\\\\u2019s tendency to shower with students, sometimes several times a day, and to loiter in the locker room area. Two students said that their reports of abuse had been relayed to higher authorities in the athletic department, including at least two former athletic directors.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But the report also revealed that a \\\\u201cself-described\\\\u201d investigation in 1994 by Ohio State\\\\u2019s director of sports medicine, Dr. John Lombardo, dismissed accusations against Dr. Strauss as \\\\u201cunfounded rumors.\\\\u201d Dr. Lombardo, who said he had conducted the investigation after a former fencing coach had raised concerns about Dr. Strauss\\\\u2019s interactions with fencers, declined to be interviewed by the investigators.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cDespite the persistence, seriousness and regularity of such complaints, no meaningful action was taken by the university to investigate or address the concerns until January 1996,\\\\u201d the report said.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">That summer, Dr. Strauss was first suspended and then removed from his post, but he remained a tenured faculty member. Dr. Strauss then opened an off-campus clinic, where he continued to abuse students. He was still a professor emeritus at the time of his death, though Ohio State said Friday that it would begin the process of revoking that status.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">This is the second time in less than a year that the Ohio State\\\\u2019s athletic department has faced scrutiny for failing to address its knowledge of abuse more forthrightly. Last summer, Urban Meyer, then the Buckeyes\\\\u2019 football coach, was found to have known for years that one of his assistants, Zach Smith, had been accused of assault by his former wife.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Meyer insisted that he had \\\\u201calways followed proper protocols and procedures\\\\u201d by \\\\u201celevating the issues to the proper channels,\\\\u201d but he was placed on administrative leave during an investigation and suspended for three games for failing to appropriately manage an employee. In December, he announced his retirement.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">In the Strauss report, investigators laid out how, starting as early as 1979, athletes reported coming in for treatment for a variety of ailments, including one who had a sore throat, only to find that Dr. Strauss would touch their genitals. The accounts were so numerous, the report said, that investigators elected not to include an exhaustive accounting of each one. But those that were included \\\\u2014 a student who reported going for treatment of an ear problem and having his genitals fondled as part of the examination, a wrestler required to strip naked and walk across a room so Dr. Strauss could evaluate his gait \\\\u2014 were clear red flags to the coaches and trainers later told about them.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cFrom roughly 1979 to 1996,\\\\u201d the report said, \\\\u201cmale students complained that Strauss routinely performed excessive \\\\u2014 and seemingly medically unnecessary \\\\u2014 genital exams, regardless of the medical condition the student-patients presented.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The report also said that in one case, when a student responded to abuse \\\\u201cwith anger and some physicality,\\\\u201d Dr. Strauss accused the student of assaulting him.</p><div class=\"css-79elbk\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><div class=\"css-z3e15g\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper-hidden\"></div><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-children\"><figure aria-label=\"media\" class=\"css-11ih1w2 e1g7ppur0\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/sports/17osu2/merlin_154980549_a04329c2-a79b-4c08-b712-83d0513ee401-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" role=\"group\"><div class=\"css-zgakxe erfvjey0\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Image</span><img alt=\"\" class=\"css-1m50asq\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/sports/17osu2/merlin_154980549_a04329c2-a79b-4c08-b712-83d0513ee401-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" itemprop=\"url\" sizes=\"50vw\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/sports/17osu2/merlin_154980549_a04329c2-a79b-4c08-b712-83d0513ee401-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/sports/17osu2/merlin_154980549_a04329c2-a79b-4c08-b712-83d0513ee401-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/sports/17osu2/merlin_154980549_a04329c2-a79b-4c08-b712-83d0513ee401-jumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/sports/17osu2/merlin_154980549_a04329c2-a79b-4c08-b712-83d0513ee401-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1803w\"/></div><figcaption class=\"css-1e7005o e1xdpqjp0\" itemprop=\"caption description\"><span class=\"css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0\">An Ohio State investigation found that Dr. Richard Strauss, a team doctor employed by the university for two decades, sexually abused 177 men.</span><span class=\"css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Credit</span><span>Uncredited/Ohio State University, via Associated Press</span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Still, as late as 1995, Dr. Strauss received nothing lower than \\\\u201cexcellent\\\\u201d on his performance evaluation.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The report released Friday was based on a yearlong investigation by Perkins Coie, a law firm that said it had conducted more than 500 interviews. \\\\u201cWith rare exceptions, we found the survivor accounts concerning their experiences with Strauss to be both highly credible and cross-corroborative,\\\\u201d the report said.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">There are numerous lawsuits pending against the university from victims of Dr. Strauss.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Nick Nutter, a heavyweight wrestler at Ohio State, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/us/politics/ohio-state-wrestlers-abuse-me-too.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">said last year</a> that Dr. Strauss groped him \\\\u201c19 exams out of 20.\\\\u201d He said he was inspired to come forward after watching gymnasts accuse Larry Nassar, a former Michigan State doctor, of sexual abuse.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Other wrestlers also spoke out about their abuse, including Michael Rodriguez, who said, \\\\u201cWhen you\\\\u2019d get a lesion or breakout or infection on your face, you took a rough elbow, whatever, the intimacy with which he would conduct that examination was as creepy and inappropriate as the \\\\u2018turn your head and cough\\\\u2019 stuff.\\\\u201d</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Strauss was team physician for several sports, including the men\\\\u2019s swimming, wrestling, gymnastics, fencing and lacrosse teams, and sometimes treated athletes from other sports as well.

Her campaign is winding down the role for one of her longest-serving political and digital firms, Anne Lewis Strategies, where she spent $5.6 million in 2017 and 2018.

The small and midsize galleries that have long supported and nurtured unknown artists are finding it difficult to survive in the winner-take-all economy of contemporary art, meaning the next Andy Warhol or <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/arts/design/donald-judd-and-the-art-of-living.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Donald Judd</a>, who<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/03/arts/richard-bellamy-art-dealer-is-dead-at-70.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> rose through the ranks</a> of the gallery system, might never be discovered.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The art market reflects and magnifies trends in the larger economy. Recovering even faster than G.D.P., annual sales in the American market have more than doubled since the global financial crisis. According to a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://d2u3kfwd92fzu7.cloudfront.net/The_Art_Market_Report_2019.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">2019 report</a> published by Art Basel and UBS, in 2018 art sales reached nearly $30 billion, compared with just over $12 billion in 2009.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">But these numbers mask a serious problem: A small number of large galleries and artists took in most of those sales. Art that cost more than $1 million accounted for 40 percent of the market but just 3 percent of transactions. The disparity is most severe in the contemporary market, where living artists\\\\u2019 work is sold out of art galleries. In 2018, sales from the top 20 living artists accounted for 64 percent of the market. Bigger galleries, the top 5 percent in terms of turnover, accounted for more than 50 percent of sales. Sales at smaller galleries declined over the past few years.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Clare McAndrew, the author of the Basel/UBS report, explained that the affluent but not super-wealthy collectors \\\\u2014 the bankers at Goldman Sachs but not the partners \\\\u2014 who used to patronize the mid- and lower-tier galleries stopped buying art after the 2008 crash and did not come back after the economy bounced back.

When they see a Hockney painting sell for $90 million, they assume the $50,000 work they can afford is not worth buying, especially <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/01/arts/design/its-auctions-vs-galleries.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">if they can\\\\u2019t flip it</a> for a quick profit at auction.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The loss of this middle tier of collectors, along with rising rents and tougher standards for loans, means that many smaller galleries are going out of business. According to international data from Artfacts.net, in 2007 four galleries opened for every one that closed. That ratio began declining after the recession, and in 2017 more galleries closed than opened.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">In the art world, small and midsize galleries serve an important function. Artists normally start at smaller galleries, where their work develops and they become known to collectors. Though galleries\\\\u2019 motives are not always pure, they play an important role in creating the pipeline of new artists. They mentor their artists, supporting them financially, introducing them to collectors and sometimes steering their work.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Small and midsize galleries are able to nurture up-and-coming artists because their more established artists bring in sales. Relying on these few artists for most of their sales has always posed an enormous risk for smaller galleries, because the artists who find success often will no longer remain exclusive to a small gallery and seek out a bigger one. In this high-stakes market, it happens faster and more frequently: An emerging artist has an even greater incentive to move on and quickly to reap the benefits of the superstar economy. Art news is full of sought-after artists leaving their <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2018/07/12/jacolby-satterwhite-now-represented-mitchell-innes-nash/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">smaller galleries</a> for the likes of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2017/11/08/josh-smith-now-shows-david-zwirner/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">David Zwirner</a> or <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2016/05/jerry-saltz-on-alex-israel-and-eating-our-young.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Gagosian</a>.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">It creates a vicious cycle where small and medium-size galleries get squeezed out. Without them, it is unclear where the new artists from future generations will come from. In a winner-take-all art market, the artists who thrive are those with the political savvy to court top galleries early in their career or brand themselves to become Instagram stars. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">A market where extremely rich people pay too much for mediocre art and shut out the <!-- -->not-quite-as rich<!-- --> may not be the biggest issue in a wildly polarized economy.

That theory is: The world will get better when we show where things have gone wrong. A lot of what we do in our business is expose error, cover problems and identify conflict.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The problem with this is that we leave people feeling disempowered and depressed. People who consume a lot of media of this sort sink into this toxic vortex \\\\u2014 alienated from people they don\\\\u2019t know, fearful about the future. They are less mobilized to take action, not more.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Bornstein, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/david-bornstein?module=inline\" title=\"\">who writes for The Times</a> and also co-founded the Solutions Journalism Network, says that you\\\\u2019ve got to expose problems, but you\\\\u2019ve also got to describe how the problems are being tackled.

Charles Perry was incarcerated for nearly two decades and now connects community members to health care systems in Chicago. Dylan T\\\\xeate was an Army ranger who served in Iraq, suffered from PTSD and has built communities in New Orleans for vets. Sarah Adkins came home one Sunday to find her husband had killed their kids and himself, and she now runs a free pharmacy and leads a life of service in Appalachian Ohio.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Pancho Arg\\\\xfcelles works in Texas, accompanying workers who have suffered spinal cord injuries on the job. He helps find the diapers, wheelchairs and other things that will allow them to live with dignity. Pancho radiates a deep wisdom, almost a holiness. As he and the others spoke about their values, the same thought kept pounding in my head: How is this not a story? Why don\\\\u2019t we cover these people more?</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">At most conferences people lead with their bios, but at this gathering people led with their pain. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">A prominent researcher described how she was abused as a child, and how this led her into her research into children\\\\u2019s emotional development. A woman from South Carolina talked about loved ones she had lost and the time she tried to talk a man out of jumping off a bridge, finally confessing: If you jump, I\\\\u2019m going to jump, too. A man admitted that all the people he had loved had left him, and that he had lived with the trauma believing that his wife will leave him, too. In the atmosphere created this week he felt free to let go of that trauma.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">It was emotionally gripping through and through. The weavers know how to open relationships with vulnerability and they know how to build connections and move to action. Their defining feature is that they are geniuses at relationship.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">This was a gathering in which it was permissible to be an angry black person. Some of the African-American participants fully ventilated their anger at injustice. It was uncomfortable and searing, but the discomfort broke through barriers and moved us closer. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Martha Welch, a professor and researcher at Columbia, pointed out that our emotional health is dependent on connection with others. We don\\\\u2019t just regulate emotions ourselves. We co-regulate with others and need connection with others to keep from spinning out of control.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">The weavers are acutely sensitive to states of mind that can build or mar relationship: how people can feel more or less efficacy, depending on the emotional conditions in a room; how words like \\\\u201csocial justice\\\\u201d and \\\\u201cbiblical\\\\u201d can be good or bad depending on whom you are speaking with, and how much damage is done when people demand you use words their way, instead of asking: Well, what do you mean by that word?</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">There were so many acute observations about building community: \\\\u201cRelationship moves at the speed of trust. Social change moves at the speed of relationship.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cNeighbors are people we practice doing life with.\\\\u201d \\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t fix people\\\\u2019s problems; I let them unfold.

But somehow we in the media under-cover this sector. We barely cover the most important social change agents. These people are not goody-goody. They are raw, honest and sometimes rude. </p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">How did we in our business get in the spot where we spend 90 percent of our coverage on the 10 percent of our lives influenced by politics and 10 percent of our coverage on the 90 percent of our lives influenced by relationship, community and the places we live in every day?</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-g92qtk epkadsg3\"><div class=\"css-1owp1gq epkadsg0\">Related in Opinion</div><div class=\"css-15g2oxy epkadsg2\"><div class=\"css-2b3w4o e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/opinion/culture-compassion.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-bqoegj e16ij5yr5\">Opinion | David Brooks</div><div class=\"css-1hma5rr e16ij5yr2\">A Nation of Weavers</div><time class=\"css-rqb9bm e16638kd0\" datetime=\"2019-02-18\">Feb. 18, 2019</time></div><div class=\"css-rxyfbr e16ij5yr0\"><img class=\"css-32rbo2 e16ij5yr1\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/18/opinion/18brooksSub/merlin_141879903_5271bb71-70bb-407d-8c01-95a7f74cee6f-threeByTwoSmallAt2X.jpg\"/></div></a></div><div class=\"css-2b3w4o e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/opinion/pittsburgh-shooting-isolation-depression.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-bqoegj e16ij5yr5\">Opinion | David Brooks</div><div class=\"css-1hma5rr e16ij5yr2\">The New Cold War</div><time class=\"css-rqb9bm e16638kd0\" datetime=\"2018-10-29\">Oct. 29, 2018</time></div><div class=\"css-rxyfbr e16ij5yr0\"><img class=\"css-32rbo2 e16ij5yr1\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/opinion/29brooksWeb/29brooksWeb-threeByTwoSmallAt2X.jpg\"/></div></a></div><div class=\"css-2b3w4o e16ij5yr6\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/opinion/working-class-men.html?action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;pgtype=Article\"><div class=\"css-i9gxme e16ij5yr4\"><div class=\"css-bqoegj e16ij5yr5\">Opinion | David Brooks</div><div class=\"css-1hma5rr e16ij5yr2\">The Rise of the Haphazard Self</div><time class=\"css-rqb9bm e16638kd0\" datetime=\"2019-05-13\">May 13, 2019</time></div><div class=\"css-rxyfbr e16ij5yr0\"><img class=\"css-32rbo2 e16ij5yr1\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/opinion/13brooksWeb/merlin_134828871_deca8fe4-57b6-4bad-9ca3-36aa78df8ae5-threeByTwoSmallAt2X.jpg\"/></div></a></div></div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-176h8r7 etfikam0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> to the editor.

His mother woke early on Sundays to prepare the lunch they\\\\u2019d eat after church. One of his favorites, he told me recently: lamb, the meat folded into a cast-iron pot, marinated in burned sugar and the ruddy yellow curry powder that is common across the Caribbean, as British as it is Indian. \\\\u201cShe\\\\u2019d cook it low, low, low,\\\\u201d he said, in not much more than the meat\\\\u2019s own fat, more of a pan-roast than a stew, then take the family to services and serve the meat afterward, melting and hot, with macaroni pie, rice and peas, coleslaw, potato salad. The meal delivered an hour of pleasure in a day not easy on children. At Full Gospel Assembly, where Carmichael\\\\u2019s parents still worship, an evening liturgy follows the morning one.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Another Carmichael childhood memory: the curried chow mein his brother Pedro cooked, built on a base of deeply caramelized onions run through with cumin, garlic and more of that curry powder, the noodles tossed with stir-fried chicken and vegetables, salty with soy sauce. The Carmichaels are a family of chefs. Pedro now teaches cooking at West Herts College, northwest of London. His chow mein, Paul said, was \\\\u201cdelicious,\\\\u201d inserting a celebratory, profane adverb in front of the adjective.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1l6nq8w\" style=\"margin:0 auto\"><div class=\"medium css-17dprlf\" data-id=\"100000006500408\" data-slug=\"19mag-eat-pullquote1\" style=\"max-width:600px\"><iframe class=\"css-sqdgy8\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/admin/100000006500408.embedded.html?\" width=\"100%\"></iframe></div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">Curry powder, rice, soy sauce, the savory zing of sugar cooked black: These are among the tastes of Caribbean cooking, ingredients and techniques brought to the islands by slavery, colonialism, indentured servitude. They have melded over centuries into a cuisine unto itself: kind of African, Arawak, British, Chinese, French, Spanish, Indian; kind of not. Carmichael laughed when we were talking about it, trying to figure it out \\\\u2014 how curry powder moved through the Commonwealth nations of Britain, from East Indies to West; how well mango chutney goes with soy sauce and fried rice; how there are clear African roots in Bajan cou-cou; and how, gloriously, food can bring comfort to the afflicted, can stay cultures that others would erase. \\\\u201cCaribbean food is fusion cooking where the fusion actually happened over time in real life,\\\\u201d he said. \\\\u201cEveryone wants to find likeness and common ground in it, instead of just accepting it for what it is.\\\\u201d What it is, he said, \\\\u201cis tasty.\\\\u201d</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">We talked after a light dinner I had at Seiobo, just off a late flight from Melbourne, that perfectly illustrated his point of view. Seiobo is part of David Chang\\\\u2019s growing empire of Momofuku restaurants that are generally somehow Asian in cuisine or cooking style. But Carmichael, since his arrival in Australia in 2015, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/dining/momofuku-seiobo-review-sydney.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">has steered Seiobo in a very different direction</a>. My snack-menu dinner that night might have been served at a restaurant in Trinidad or Guyana: deep-fried paddles of Australian crab, with slices of lime and a pile of curried rice. The crab was lumpy and sweet, pure in flavor below its crust, but it was the rice that shocked and demanded conversation. It was built on a base of long-cooked curry paste: a beautiful dark golden hue, fragrant with cumin, cardamom, coriander, a big hit of ginger and garlic, with minced habanero for heat and a salty punch of soy and oyster sauces hovering over it all. It seemed to tell the story of Caribbean food in just a couple of bites.</p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\"><div class=\"css-z3e15g\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper-hidden\"></div><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-children\"><figure aria-label=\"media\" class=\"css-jcw7oy e1g7ppur0\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/magazine/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY-articleLarge.png?quality=90&amp;auto=webp\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" role=\"group\"><div class=\"css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Image</span><img alt=\"\" class=\"css-1m50asq\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/magazine/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" itemprop=\"url\" sizes=\"((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw\" src=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/magazine/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY-articleLarge.png?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale\" srcset=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/magazine/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY-articleLarge.png?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/magazine/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY-jumbo.png?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/magazine/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY/19mag-eat-slide-OQNY-superJumbo.png?quality=90&amp;auto=webp 2048w\"/></div><figcaption class=\"css-1l44abu e1xdpqjp0\" itemprop=\"caption description\"><span class=\"css-i48y28 e13ogyst0\">Curry paste.</span><span class=\"css-nt1l96 e1z0qqy90\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\"><span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">Credit</span><span>Bobby Doherty for The New York Times.

Use as much as you need to season the rice, which is an ideal side dish for fried fish or chicken, for soft-shell crabs, for paillards of pork, for stew. However much you require, there\\\\u2019ll be some left over, even if you season your rice aggressively. That\\\\u2019s a great opportunity. The paste keeps well in the refrigerator. Later, you can use it to spice up instant ramen or to enliven ground meat for a Caribbean-ish version of sloppy joes; to make a kind of curried stew of vegetables or beef; or to rub all over a leg of lamb.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\">\\\\u201cIt\\\\u2019s weird, man,\\\\u201d Carmichael said. \\\\u201cPeople in Sydney find comfort in the way that we cook here, and sometimes I think it\\\\u2019s because they taste these flavors that are Asian, and they think it\\\\u2019s Asian food. But it\\\\u2019s more complicated than that. I\\\\u2019m making this food from a cuisine that\\\\u2019s super diverse and really young, that doesn\\\\u2019t have thousands of years of history behind it, only hundreds.\\\\u201d It is food that requires both explanation and none at all.</p><p class=\"css-18icg9x evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">Recipe: </strong><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020231-paul-carmichaels-curried-rice\" title=\"\">Paul Carmichael\\\\u2019s Curried Rice</a></p></div><aside class=\"css-o6xoe7\"></aside></div></section>]', 'link': '/2019/05/13/magazine/curried-rice-paul-carmichael-recipe.html', 'title': '<title data-rh=\"true\">The Evolution of Curried Rice - The New York Times</title>'}})\n"
