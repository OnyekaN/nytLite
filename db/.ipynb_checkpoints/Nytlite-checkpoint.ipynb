In 2018, there were 233 cases in 41 states, the largest reported outbreak so far, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6827e1.htm?s_cid=mm6827e1_e&amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM4248\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the agency reported</a> Tuesday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In alternate years, there have been small numbers of cases and 2019, with 11 confirmed cases so far, is looking like other off years, C.D.C. officials said. Still, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the agency’s principal deputy director, cautioned parents and clinicians to be aware of possible symptoms and report suspected cases quickly.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We don’t right now have an explanation for the every-other-year pattern,” she said, “and we really need to be ready to rapidly detect, report and investigate each case this year and be ready for possibly a bad year this year.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Children affected by A.F.M. have been 5 years old on average, and most were previously healthy but had “a mild respiratory illness or fever less than a week before they developed arm or leg weakness,” Dr. Schuchat said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There has been no common denominator found so far among affected children, and officials said they were undertaking an intensive surveillance project with seven children’s hospitals in hopes of learning more.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Why this child and not the other child, why not the sibling who also had the respiratory infection where we’re pretty sure that the same virus was running around the family?” Dr. Schuchat said. “Those are critical questions.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Tom Clark, deputy director of the C.D.C.’s division of viral diseases, said 98 percent of patients were hospitalized, more than half in intensive care units, and more than a quarter needed machines to help them breathe.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said that at least 70 to 80 percent of children whose cases had been followed still had some limb weakness months after developing A.F.M. He said the C.D.C. was now evaluating every 2018 case, looking at each child’s muscle condition, strength and daily functioning ability at different points in the year after diagnosis.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While no proven treatment has yet been found, Dr. Clark said there was some indication that “early and aggressive physical therapy and rehabilitation” might help children regain some strength and function.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And though the cause has not been determined, Dr. Clark said that traces of viruses had been found in respiratory and stool samples, and that in two cases, patients’ spinal fluid — the strongest link to a neurological disease — was positive for an enterovirus.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One possible culprit is enterovirus 68, he said, because there have been more A.F.M. cases in years when more of that respiratory virus was detected. “We really do suspect viruses play a role and <!-- -->enteroviruses among<!-- --> the leading suspects,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p>',\n",

       " 'acosta-epstein-fact-check': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At a news conference in Washington, R. Alexander Acosta, the labor secretary and a former United States attorney in Florida, on Wednesday gave his account of how federal prosecutors dealt with allegations that Jeffrey Epstein had abused young women and girls, a case first handled by state prosecutors. Here’s how his version of events stacks up against what we know. </p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What Mr. Acosta Said</p><p class=\"css-ma92ss evys1bk0\">“Simply put, the Palm Beach state attorney’s office was ready to let Epstein walk free, no jail time, nothing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Prosecutors who worked with Mr. Acosta said that the federal case presented them with legal challenges that made the matter more suited to a state court. Federal laws, they said, would have required the United States attorney’s office to prove that Mr. Epstein, a financier, crossed state lines with the intent to commit the acts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nonetheless, federal prosecutors had legal firepower and resources not available to a local prosecutor. That was especially important for a case that presented such complex legal and logistical challenges, involved a large number of victims — up to 40 at the time of the deal — and the prospect of facing the best defense lawyers and private investigators Mr. Epstein’s money could buy. Local law enforcement officials and the F.B.I. referred the case to Mr. Acosta, in part because they feared Mr. Epstein would face no more than a single state charge related to prostitution, which warranted a fine and no jail time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Investigators involved in the case were hoping Mr. Acosta could pursue a case that would impose a more substantial penalty on Mr. Epstein. The outcome negotiated by Mr. Acosta’s office was a plea deal with state prosecutors on two prostitution charges that led Mr. Epstein to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach County jail and be registered as a sex offender. During his sentence, he was permitted to participate in a work-release program that allowed him to go to his office six days a week for 12 hours a day. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Barry Krischer, the former top prosecutor for Palm Beach County, said on Wednesday that Mr. Acosta was trying to “rewrite history” by suggesting that state prosecutors were going to be even more lenient toward Mr. Epstein.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I can emphatically state that Mr. Acosta’s recollection of this matter is completely wrong,” Mr. Krischer said in a statement. “Federal prosecutors do not take a back seat to state prosecutors. That’s not how the system works in the real world.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If Mr. Acosta believed the state deal was so terrible, he should have filed a federal indictment instead of conducting “secret negotiations,” Mr. Krischer said.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What Mr. Acosta Said</p><p class=\"css-ma92ss evys1bk0\">“She talks about the challenges faced, she talks about the victims being scared and traumatized, refusing to testify, and how some victims actually exonerated Epstein. Most had significant concerns about their identities being revealed. The acts that they had faced were horrible and they didn’t want people to know about them.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Acosta was referring to a federal prosecutor on his staff and the possibility that victims might not be willing to testify against Mr. Epstein. Adam Horowitz, a lawyer who represented some of the victims, said that Mr. Acosta’s arguments at the news conference were disingenuous. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said that the young women were scared to testify, but that it was because the prosecutors had terrified them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The prosecutors were saying, ‘These defense lawyers are going to go through your whole personal life, dig up your bad acts and your sex life. When they heard that from prosecutors, sure, they were intimidated,” Mr. Horowitz said. “They kept saying, ‘Are you <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">sure </em>you want to do this?’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Eventually, after years and under different circumstances, many of the victims did<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em>talk — to a Miami Herald<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em>reporter — telling the paper that they were dissatisfied with the efforts of Mr. Acosta’s office. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a pool of victims so large, it is inevitable that some of them will resist going through to trial, said Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer for three of the victims. But two of his three clients gave depositions and were “willing and ready” to testify, he said.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What Mr. Acosta Said</p><p class=\"css-ma92ss evys1bk0\"> “We believe that we proceeded appropriately, that based on the evidence and not just my opinion but I have shared the affidavit. Based on the evidence, there was value to getting a guilty plea and having him register.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is impossible to know how members of a jury might have responded to the evidence if it had been presented to them in a federal trial — or whether efforts by Mr. Epstein’s team to pressure the victims or intimidate prosecutors would have worked. But Mr. Acosta’s decision to accept a plea deal was widely — but not universally — supported by his own team at the time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A. Marie Villafaña, the lead prosecutor in the case and one of the few women in Mr. Acosta’s leadership team, pushed him to bring charges even if it risked losing in court. She was eventually overruled, and helped Mr. Acosta work out the logistics of the plea deal.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What Mr. Acosta Said</p><p class=\"css-ma92ss evys1bk0\">“When it was finally clear that Epstein would comply with the agreement, she talks about how she made efforts to notify the victims, how that was a Friday afternoon at 4:15 and that she learned that the state had scheduled the plea for 8:30 the following Monday. And she talks about how over the weekend, she made every effort to notify the victims at that time.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Acosta was referring to efforts by Ms. Villafaña to reach the victims. His office began directly negotiating a plea agreement with Mr. Epstein’s lawyers in August 2007, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article221404845.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">according to The Miami Herald</a>. They reached an agreement on Sept. 24 of that year, but talks continued until June 2008, when Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in court.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">From the time the F.B.I. began investigating Mr. Epstein in 2006 to Sept. 24, 2007, Mr. Acosta’s office “never conferred with the victims” or informed them that such an agreement was under consideration, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5746048/Epstein.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a 2019 federal court ruling shows</a>. The ruling notes that Mr. Epstein’s lawyers sought assurances that the victims would be kept in the dark.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Acosta cited an affidavit from Ms. Villafaña, who stated that she did not notify victims because she was worried about negotiations over a provision that would allow the victims to obtain monetary damages. She said she was concerned that Mr. Epstein’s lawyers would undermine the credibility of the victims if negotiations fell through and the case went to trial.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even after the agreement was reached with Mr. Epstein, the prosecutors kept the details from victims. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The victims received letters from the F.B.I. in January 2008 informing them that the case was still under investigation, but not disclosing the agreement. Six months later, a lawyer for the victims, Bradley Edwards, met with a prosecutor to discuss the case — again, the agreement was left unmentioned.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On June 27, 2008, Mr. Edwards was informed that Mr. Epstein would plead guilty in court, but was not told that the state plea would be the resolution to the federal case. Mr. Horowitz said nobody reached out to any of his seven clients before Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty on June 30, 2008. And Mr. Kuvin said that lawyers had to fight in court for months to learn the details of the deal.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What Mr. Acosta Said</p><p class=\"css-ma92ss evys1bk0\">“The meeting that was alleged was a breakfast meeting that took place after the agreement was negotiated, not before. The agreement was signed in September.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Acosta is correct that the meeting he had with Jay Lefkowitz, one of Mr. Epstein’s lawyers, took place about two weeks after the plea agreement was reached in September 2007. It is less clear what they discussed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a letter to Mr. Acosta, Mr. Lefkowitz noted the meeting took place on Oct. 12, 2007, and thanked Mr. Acosta for his “commitment” to not contact any victims or witnesses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After the meeting, Mr. Epstein’s lawyers continued to negotiate an addendum and objected repeatedly to notifying the victims.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Patricia Mazzei contributed reporting. </em></p>',\n",

       " 'adidas-diversity-employees': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the United States, Adidas has built much of its name — and sales — through its association with black superstars. In the 1980s, the seminal hip-hop group Run-DMC gave the company’s sneakers and apparel cultural cachet through its song “My Adidas.” Popular black athletes and entertainers like James Harden, Candace Parker and Kanye West endorse its products.<br/></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In April, Adidas announced <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/style/beyonce-adidas-collaboration.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a new partnership</a> with Beyoncé Knowles. Ms. Knowles posted a photo on <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BwuX3GJBYyI/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Beyonce\\'s Instagram Feed\">Instagram</a> that showed her reclining on a pile of Adidas sneakers and wearing a red Adidas bodysuit. The image was liked more than seven million times.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Black employees at the company’s North American headquarters in Portland, Ore., however, describe a workplace culture that contradicts the brand’s image. Interviews with more than 20 current or former Adidas employees show the company’s predominantly white leadership struggling with issues of race and discrimination. On the campus, known as Adidas Village, the employees say, race is a constant issue, leaving the relatively few black employees often feeling marginalized and sometimes discriminated against.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Of the nearly 1,700 Adidas employees at the Portland campus, fewer than 4.5 percent identify as black, according to internal employment figures from last summer that were shared with The New York Times.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Adidas employees who spoke to The Times said that in the company cafeteria, black employees often sit together. Some said they had been told that this made some of their white colleagues nervous and could hurt their chances of getting promotions or being put on important marketing campaigns if it appeared that they were not trying to fit the Adidas mold.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Several current and former Adidas employees said they were frequently the only black person in meetings and often felt their input was not valued when decisions were being made. And an overall lack of racial diversity, they said, meant it was not uncommon for negative stereotypes to creep into work discussions or marketing pitches involving black athletes, sometimes creating backlash outside the company. Even when such ideas were scuttled before becoming part of official advertising campaigns, black employees said, the conversations left them feeling uncomfortable.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For many, the internal tensions at Adidas reflect a larger issue facing the American sports apparel industry, which has a combined annual revenue of more than $20 billion on shoe sales alone. Companies like Adidas, Nike and Under Armour have work forces that are primarily white, but their most influential customers — those who make their products desirable to others — often are not.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At Adidas, the issues involving race are not limited to business, black employees said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two black employees said they had been referred to with a common racist slur by white co-workers, one verbally and one in a text message seen by The Times. In both instances, the people believed the slur was intended as a joke, which they felt only highlighted the company’s skewed perspective on race.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">All of the current and former employees spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared hurting their careers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Karen Parkin, the global head of human resources for Adidas, said in an interview that the company knew that it had work to do on the issue of race.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Parkin said Adidas had “zero tolerance” for inappropriate behavior. She said that she was unaware of the incidents involving the slurs and that, if they had been reported to human resources, an investigation would have occurred.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We want to be humble,” Ms. Parkin said. “We’re not where we need to be in all of the locations around the world. But we’re not afraid to have the conversation, either.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For Adidas, the ties to black stars have paid off. The company’s stock, which trades in Germany, where its global headquarters are, has more than doubled in the last three years. Its revenue has been growing robustly, and its share of the North American sports-footwear market has jumped to 11 percent from 4 percent since 2015, according to the market research company NPD Group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the case of Mr. West, Adidas positioned his Yeezy brand as its own category inside the company. Mr. West earns 5 percent royalties on net sales of his shoes and apparel, according to a person inside the company with knowledge of the relationship. Yeezy sales are expected to top $1.3 billion this year. A spokeswoman for Mr. West declined to comment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The benefits from the collaboration extend beyond selling $350 high-top shoes and high-end designer apparel. Almost overnight, Mr. West helped to make Adidas cool again.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The association with Kanye West and how he sees himself as an artist — with design, music and culture — said this Adidas brand is not just a typical sports brand,” Mark King, then the head of Adidas North America, said in an interview with the trade publication Footwear News in 2016. “It’s one that looks at creativity and considers both sports and culture.” (Mr. King stepped down from his role in 2018.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After Mr. West made his Adidas deal, other hip-hop stars like Pusha T established relationships with the company. Pharrell Williams, who was already working with Adidas, signed a new deal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think Adidas is trying to align itself with the fans of those artists,” said Matt Powell, an analyst with NPD Group. “These artists have tremendous followings and fans. Those fans want to dress like their idols.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is much different inside the company. Fewer than 75 of the nearly 1,700 Adidas employees in Portland identify as black, according to the internal employment figures from last summer. Nearly 78 percent of the employees are white.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An Adidas spokeswoman, Stacey Marsh, did not dispute the figures obtained by The Times, and declined to comment on the composition of the staff at the company’s Portland headquarters. She said that 55 percent of the company’s total employee base in the United States, which includes employees paid hourly wages in its retail stores, were people of color.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Only three people, or about 1 percent, of Adidas’s roughly 340 worldwide vice presidents last year were black, according to two people with knowledge of the figures. One of the black executives, a female head of operations, has since departed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Marsh said that Adidas could not provide information on the race or ethnicity of its employees at a global level because of country-specific laws.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The employee figures for other sports apparel giants are similarly stark. Last year, when Footwear News <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://footwearnews.com/2018/business/retail/40-under-40-shoe-young-executives-retailers-1202556866/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">highlighted</a> the top 40 people under 40 who it said were revolutionizing the shoe industry, the list did not include a single black person.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nike says that at the end of 2017, about 23 percent of its American employees, including those working at its retail stores, were black. Of the company’s 353 vice presidents, 29, or 8 percent, were black.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Under Armour’s website lists its goals related to diversity and inclusion, but the company declined to provide data on the makeup of its work force for this article.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Companies spend billions of dollars on marketing and advertising to attract African-American kids to their products, but they don’t do much to support the African-Americans on the inside,” said D’Wayne Edwards, who started designing shoes in 1989 and worked at Nike, where he designed Air Jordan shoes. He now runs Pensole Footwear Design Academy in Portland.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What is frustrating is that none of us are empowered to change it,” he added. “Some companies have said for years that they want to create a diverse workplace, but if anything, the numbers are getting worse. And they don’t care. It’s a lot of lip service.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The lack of diversity at Adidas has resulted in missteps that black employees argue could put the entire brand at risk.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This year, Adidas released all-white sneakers as part of a line meant to commemorate Black History Month. It <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/business/gucci-blackface-adidas-apologize.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">removed the sneakers</a> from stores after an outcry.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2012, Adidas released a pair of $350 sneakers featuring shackles. After the company faced boycott calls led by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the sneakers were <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/fashion/adidas-cancels-release-of-shackle-sneakers.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">pulled</a> and Adidas apologized for offending consumers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At other times, it has fallen to black employees to stop insensitive marketing ideas before they were carried out.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2016, there was a meeting about the company’s latest sneaker for Mr. Harden, the Houston Rockets star. One idea was to make the shoe part of the company’s “uncaged” line. The ads for “Harden Uncaged,” the thinking went, could feature Mr. Harden breaking free from a prison cell.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When someone raised the question of whether such an image would invoke a negative racial stereotype, the proposal was rejected, according to three people who were at the meeting or aware of the idea and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The shoe was eventually marketed as Harden LS, for lifestyle.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another idea, titled “All Rise,” featured Damian Lillard of the Portland Trail Blazers as a defendant in a courtroom, according to an employee involved in the discussion. Again, it was scuttled when a black employee pointed out the racial overtones of a black man’s being put on trial.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When asked about these instances, Ms. Marsh, the Adidas spokeswoman, said the company would not comment on “every anonymous rumor or allegation.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At a town hall-style staff meeting at the Portland campus in spring 2018, Zion Armstrong, the current president of Adidas North America, acknowledged that the company needed to intensify its diversity efforts, according to three people who were there.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Months later, with no visible change in the company’s hiring efforts, an anonymous letter addressed to Mr. Armstrong and critical of Adidas’s strategies for becoming more diverse made its way <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://footwearnews.com/2018/focus/athletic-outdoor/adidas-black-minority-employees-diversity-1202705284/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">around the campus.</a> It was reported at the time by Footwear News.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A few weeks later, Mr. Armstrong attended a meeting of Progressive Soles, an employee-led organization within Adidas whose members are mostly minorities, and seemingly contradicted his earlier comments.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He declared that Adidas did not have a race problem, according to two people in attendance. Instead, he said, the company’s demographics reflected those of Portland, which is 77 percent white and 6 percent black, according to 2017 Census Bureau statistics. When asked why more black employees were not being promoted, Mr. Armstrong said there simply were not any who were ready.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Adidas declined to make Mr. Armstrong available for an interview and did not respond to questions about his meeting with Progressive Soles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Several current and former Adidas employees said that minority employees often left the company in hopes of getting better jobs or higher pay after not receiving promotions they believed they deserved.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A few years ago, when some black employees recognized that there were not many black candidates going through the company’s internship program, Progressive Soles began recruiting efforts outside the Portland area to attract a more diverse pool of applicants. But few of those internships have led to job offers for the black candidates, several people at the company said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Parkin noted that Portland “isn’t the most diverse city in the U.S.,” and said that Adidas “needs to be more courageous and bold” in attracting more diverse employees to the area.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re on that journey right now,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some artists are not simply taking the company’s word.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Late last year, shortly before the internal letter to Mr. Armstrong became public, Pharrell Williams went to Portland to see Adidas Village for himself, according to two employees. He walked around the campus, visiting with various groups, including those in the basketball division, that he does not normally work with, the employees said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Williams declined to comment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://wwd.com/fashion-news/intimates/pharrell-williams-adidas-nmd-human-project-10565164/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">2016 interview with Women’s Wear Daily</a>, Mr. Williams said that one of his apparel and sneaker lines for Adidas called Hu — short for human — was about the “recognition and celebration of different colors, spirituality and cultures.” But last year, Mr. Williams and Adidas were criticized after the release of the “Hu Holi Powder Dye Collection.” Some said they had appropriated aspects of the Holi Festival, an annual Hindu tradition.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During his visit to the Adidas campus, Mr. Williams met with Mr. Armstrong to discuss inclusivity and sat down with members of Progressive Soles. There, he spoke candidly about his upbringing and why he had signed with Adidas, according to a person who was at the meeting. Then he indicated his desire to use his star power to push Adidas toward greater diversity.</p>',\n",

Seen from a distance, they made up thin blue lines snaking across the barren tan mountainside along narrow trails traced in the dirt, converging from several directions on the little school in the bottom of the valley.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wearing powder blue school uniforms and white head scarves, many of the girls, ages 7 to 18, had already been walking for an hour or more by the time they arrived at the school. There were smaller groups of boys, too, mostly out of uniform, walking apart from the girls.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By 7:45, they were all gathered for assembly in the yard of the Rustam School, in a remote corner of Afghanistan’s Yakawlang District. It is the area’s only high school, years 1 through 12, and has an enrollment of 330 girls and 146 boys — astonishing in a country where normally <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.unicef.org/afghanistan/media/2471/file/afg-report-oocs2018.pdf%20.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">only a third</a> of girls attend school.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">BAMIYAN</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">YAKAWLANG</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">DISTRICT</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">Kabul</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">AFGHANISTAN</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">50 MILES</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">TAJIK.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">UZBEK.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">TURKMENISTAN</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">Area of</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">detail</p><p class=\"g-pstyle7\">AFGHANISTAN</p><p class=\"g-pstyle8\">Kandahar</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">PAKISTAN</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">200 MILES</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The principal, Mohammad Sadiq Nasiri, 49, gave his daily pep talk: Getting into university is going to be harder than ever this year, so they are going to have to do better than ever.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rustam may seem an unlikely place to encourage collegiate dreams. With seven crude stone classrooms, supplemented by six big tents, there are so many students that they are divided into morning and afternoon sessions only four hours long.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There is no electricity, heat, working computers or copy machines. Many school materials are written out in longhand by teachers. Foreign aid once helped but has dried up. One teacher said she has fewer books than students.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Only 5 percent of the students have parents who can read and write, Mr. Nasiri said. Most are the children of subsistence farmers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet Rustam’s 2017 graduating class saw 60 of 65 graduates accepted to Afghanistan’s public universities, a 92 percent college entrance rate. Two-thirds of those accepted were girls. A couple of years earlier, 97 percent of the graduates went to college.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Unlike most Afghan schools, Rustam mixes boys and girls in its classrooms. “Men and women are equal,” the principal said. “They have the same brains and the same bodies.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added, “We tell these boys and girls, there is no difference between you guys, and you will all be together when you go to college, so you need to learn how to respect one another.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One day late in the spring term, Badan Joya, one of five female teachers among the school’s 12, was teaching a fourth-grade math class in one of the overflow tents. A piece of cardboard painted black served as a chalkboard, with simple algebra formulas scribbled on it. She asked her students, nearly all girls, to name their favorite subject. They chorused: “Math.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That is not surprising at Rustam; 40 percent of questions on the college entrance exams cover mathematics, more than any other subject. And the girls excel.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The head student in 11th-grade math, based on test scores, is Shahrbano Hakimi, 17. Ms. Hakimi is also head student in her computer class, where, on that recent day, the girls were studying the Windows operating system, from books. Only one of the 60 students had a computer at home.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The thing I wish for most in the world,” Ms. Hakimi said, “is a laptop.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, girls’ education was banned and women were mostly confined to their homes, especially in rural areas like this one in Bamiyan Province.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The local passion for education, especially among girls, is a reaction to that era, their teachers said. The fourth-grade math teacher, Ms. Joya, who is 28, did not begin school herself until the Taliban fell when she was 11; she could not read or write, and her only schooling had been sewing class.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I had to start from zero,” she said. “We tell them about the Taliban and what they did to us, and say, ‘You have an opportunity now, you should take it,’” she said. “They’re listening. They hear about it at home, too, from their mothers and aunts.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The area around Rustam is now free of Taliban and little touched by violence. In other places, families are <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/world/asia/afghanistan-schools-taliban.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">reluctant to send girls</a> to school, especially over long distances in rural parts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The girls at Rustam are highly motivated. “Honestly, girls are better than boys, they are more serious,” Mr. Nasiri said. “These kids all know that you can’t make a slave out of someone who is educated.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Except in Islamic studies, nearly all head students are girls.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Amina, “nearly 18,” who uses one name, is head girl of the entire school. She is fortunate, she said, because her father is educated, though her mother is illiterate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She will be the first of eight siblings to finish high school and hopes to go to Mawoud Academy in Kabul, a college preparatory school, even though she knows that 40 students were <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/world/asia/afghanistan-students-bombing.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">killed there recently </a>by a suicide bomber.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Amina’s favorite subject is math; she hopes to become a doctor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Hakimi also dreams of becoming a doctor, in part because her mother suffers vision problems and her father is nearly deaf at age 65. Both are illiterate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Outside their mud-walled home, a water wheel on a nearby irrigation ditch turns a small generator, just enough to power lights at night, for studying.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m not educated,” said her father, Ghulam Hussein. “I’m just a farm laborer. I don’t want them to have the same life.” Of his 11 children, a son and two daughters have already reached college.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I am so proud of them,” said Zenat, Ms. Hakimi’s mother.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Their family is also an example of why fewer boys are in school. Their son Ali, 9, stays home to help his parents, while their son Reza, 12, works in the fields. “Ali wants so badly to go to school,” Zenat said. “Maybe next year.” All the daughters, though, are in school.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One day Mr. Nasiri, the principal, noticed one of his students, 13-year-old Friba, hiding behind other girls during assembly because she was out of uniform. Her family was too poor to buy one. So he bought a swatch of blue cotton in the nearest bazaar; Ms. Joya, the math teacher, sewed a tunic from it, using her Taliban-era skills.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Nasiri borrowed the money for the cotton. He earns less than $200 a month.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In addition to running Rustam the past six years, Mr. Nasiri supported four daughters and two sons with his wife, Roya, 45. They married during Taliban times; he taught his wife to read and write.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We discussed it and decided she should go to school,” he said. “Children will do better when their mom is educated.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Their eldest daughter finished high school four years before her mother. This year Roya graduated from high school, and next year will take the college entrance exams, Mr. Nasiri said proudly. “She raised six children,” he said. “Now she raises herself.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hundreds of feet up a rocky mountainside opposite Rustam, sheep grazed, watched by shepherds. One of the shepherds wore a blue dress, much like a school uniform, but covered in dust. Her name is Nikbakht, she said; she is 13. She carried a pen and a workbook for the Pashto language.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I love school, but no one else was home so I had to work with the animals.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pashto, a required subject, is not her favorite, Nikbakht said. Math is.</p>',\n",

       " 'aid-in-dying-states': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Aug. 1, New Jersey will become the eighth state to allow doctors to prescribe lethal medication to terminally ill patients who want to end their lives. On Sept. 15, Maine will become the ninth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So by October, 22 percent of Americans will live in places where residents with six months or less to live can, in theory, exercise some control over the time and manner of their deaths. (The others: Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Montana, California, Colorado and Hawaii, as well as the District of Columbia.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But while the campaign for aid in dying continues to make gains, supporters are increasingly concerned about what happens after these laws are passed. Many force the dying to navigate an overly complicated process of requests and waiting periods, critics say.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And opt-out provisions — which allow doctors to decline to participate and health care systems to forbid their participation — are restricting access even in some places where aid in dying is legal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There are what I call deserts, where it’s difficult to find a facility that allows doctors to participate,” said Samantha Trad, the California state director of Compassion &amp; Choices, the largest national advocacy group for aid in dying.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, compared to the national media glare <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/health/physician-aid-in-dying.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">that has followed previous fights over these laws</a>, the movement’s recent victories have generated relatively little furor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re nearing a tipping point,” said Peg Sandeen, executive director of the Death With Dignity National Center, which oversaw the Maine campaign. “The issue, while still controversial, is less scary.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The New Jersey bill had neared passage several times since it was introduced seven years ago, but derailed in 2014 when Chris Christie, the governor at the time, threatened a veto. Finally, legislators passed the Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act this winter, and Gov. Philip D. Murphy signed it in April.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Maine, the state legislature voted yes this spring, but supporters were unsure what the new governor, Janet Mills, would do. As in New Jersey, a Democratic governor replaced an outgoing Republican who had promised a veto. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Gov. Mills signed the law last month. “I do believe it is a right that should be protected by law — the right to make ultimate decisions,” she said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What’s changed?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">All these laws require states to track usage and publish statistics. Their reports show that whether a state has six months or 20 years of experience, the proportion of deaths involving aid in dying (also known, to supporters’ distaste, as physician-assisted suicide) remains tiny, a fraction of a percentage point.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">California, for example, in 2017 received the mandated state documents for just 632 people who’d made the necessary two verbal requests to a physician, after which 241 doctors wrote prescriptions for 577 patients. More than 269,000 California in all died that year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With such data showing no slippery slope toward widespread use or abuse, “a lot of the hypothetical claims our opponents made no longer carry so much weight with lawmakers,” said Kim Callinan, chief executive of Compassion &amp; Choices.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Callinan also pointed to changing attitudes within the medical community, once a well funded source of opposition. In recent years, a number of national organizations and a dozen state medical societies have instead adopted neutral stances.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It levels the playing field a little,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Opponents, including Catholic organizations and some disability activists, still denounce these laws. In March, an aid-in-dying bill passed the Maryland House of Delegates but failed after a tie vote in the Senate. Opponents are attempting a ballot initiative to repeal Maine’s new law and pursuing a slow-moving court case to invalidate California’s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Public opinion polls consistently <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1681/moral-issues.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">show broad support for aid in dying</a>, however. Compassion &amp; Choices says its upcoming legislative targets include Massachusetts, Maryland again, New Mexico, New York and Nevada.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the persistently small number of users suggests that most Americans close to death would not personally choose to self-ingest barbiturates, even if they support legalizing that option. The low numbers may also reflect difficulty in actually using these laws.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A recent survey of 270 California hospitals, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that 18 months after implementation of the state’s End of Life Option Act, more than 60 percent — many of them religiously affiliated — <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2729743\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">forbade affiliated physicians to participate</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Compassion &amp; Choices is intensifying efforts to persuade local health care systems, doctors and hospices to agree to consider patients’ requests.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even aid-in-dying laws long on the books are beginning to draw renewed scrutiny.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For decades, the model has been the first-in-the-nation Oregon law, which took effect in 1997. It requires a terminally ill patient to see two doctors, make two oral requests for a lethal prescription plus one in writing, and face a 15-day waiting period.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Every state law but one incorporates those elements. (In Montana, a court legalized aid in dying, so there’s no statute.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There’s too many roadblocks in the existing legislation,” said Ms. Callinan, whose organization has long promoted that legislation. “They’ve actually made it too difficult for patients to get through the process.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Indeed, a study from Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a health system that supports patients who request and meet requirements for aid in dying, shows that at least a third of those who inquire about it <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2665731\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">become too ill to complete the process</a>, or die before they can qualify.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet states are enacting even more supposed safeguards. Hawaii, whose law took effect in January, requires a 20-day wait; both its law and a proposed Massachusetts law add a mandated mental health consultation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By contrast, the Oregon legislature recently approved an amendment waiving the waiting period in cases where the physician believes the patient will likely die within 15 days. Gov. Kate Brown has until Aug. 9 to sign it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Perhaps, Ms. Callinan proposed, aid-in-dying laws shouldn’t require waiting periods.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It takes people a long time to find a first doctor, to make an appointment, to find a second doctor, to find a pharmacist,” she said. “The process itself is a waiting period,” one often exceeding 15 days.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since rural areas face physician shortages, Compassion &amp; Choices has also urged that nurse-practitioners and physician assistants be allowed to provide aid in dying in states where they can legally write prescriptions. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Oregon, a veteran state legislator has taken an even more audacious step toward expanding access.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">State Rep. Mitch Greenlick has introduced several bills that would permit those in the early stages of dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases to use aid in dying, securing prescriptions they <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Measures/Overview/HB2232\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">could then use later as their illnesses progressed</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You could make the request when you were cognitively able to do it,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Every existing state law bars that. Those requesting aid in dying must have mental capacity; dementia patients will have lost it by the time they’re within six months of dying. National groups emphatically oppose Mr. Greenlick’s propositions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet those at heightened risk for Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, are already well aware of aid-in-dying laws, and some <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2731580\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">would opt to use them</a>, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania recently reported.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They interviewed 50 older adults enrolled in a drug study, most with family histories of Alzheimer’s, all found to have elevated levels of the biomarker amyloid. “We describe it as an increased but uncertain risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease,” said Emily Largent, a Penn bioethicist.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The team’s interviews revealed that about two-thirds of the group would reject aid in dying and about 15 percent had ambivalent responses. But one in five said they would pursue it if they became cognitively impaired, were suffering or burdening loved ones.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Overall, “very few understood that they wouldn’t be eligible” for lethal prescriptions under current laws if they developed dementia, Dr. Largent said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But they were strikingly open to legal aid in dying.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was important to have it available,” she said. “Even if they felt they wouldn’t choose aid in dying themselves, they weren’t opposed to it for others.” </p>',\n",

       " 'all-star-game-cleveland-indians': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">CLEVELAND — When the Yankees’ Aroldis Chapman took the mound for the top of the ninth inning on Tuesday night, some fans at Progressive Field chanted Rajai Davis’s name. It was a moral victory, of sorts, invoking the player whose homer off Chapman set Progressive Field ablaze in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chapman pitched for the Cubs then, and we know what happened next: Despite blowing the lead on Davis’s homer, Chapman recovered to become the winning pitcher and celebrated a title on the Indians’ field. The All-Star Game came to Cleveland this week, but the World Series has not returned.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They’re very aware of what Chapman did against us,” said Francisco Lindor, the Indians’ shortstop, who flied out against Chapman in that fateful Game 7. “When a crowd boos somebody, it’s not that they don’t respect them. They’re a little upset that they did something right against us.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chapman struck out the side on Tuesday to finish the American League’s 4-3 victory over the National League, the seventh win in a row for the A.L. In some ways, it was a Yankees kind of night: Masahiro Tanaka earned the victory, Chapman earned the save and C.\\u2009C. Sabathia, an honorary All-Star, earned the love.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sabathia, who is retiring after the season, tossed a ceremonial first pitch to the former Cleveland catcher Sandy Alomar Jr. He also made a mound visit to Chapman with two outs in the ninth, getting one last salute from the crowd. Sabathia signed with the Indians out of high school in 1998, and by the time they traded him, a decade later, he had built a foundation for the rest of his life.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I came here at 17 years old like a boy, left here at 27 years old with three kids — a grown man,” Sabathia said. “It’s always a special place for me.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sabathia helped knock Cleveland from the playoffs in 2017, and the Houston Astros did it last October. The Indians seemed headed for a teardown this season, but finished the first half on a 21-8 sprint and now lead for the second A.L. wild-card spot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For now they have saved their season, and with apologies to the Yankees, they won this All-Star Game, too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That sounds strange to say, because Lindor and Carlos Santana were hitless in five at-bats and closer Brad Hand allowed two runs. But Michael Brantley, Shane Bieber and Carlos Carrasco made it happen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The stoic Brantley, a former Indians outfielder who now stars for the Astros, drove in the game’s first run with a double. The fans roared — and he actually noticed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I had a big smile on my face, and I don’t smile too much on the baseball field,” Brantley said. “But you get a reception like that, you have to smile.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bieber was named most valuable player for striking out the side in the fifth, and Carrasco, another Indians pitcher, stood with his teammates at the end of that inning in a poignant display of unity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Carrasco, 32, revealed last weekend that he has chronic myeloid leukemia. He has been cleared to begin throwing workouts, but he has not pitched since May 30 and there is no timetable for his return. His appearance at the All-Star Game — a surprise to the players until Tuesday afternoon — was part of baseball’s Stand Up to Cancer initiative.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a message to let him know we stand up for you, we’re all next to you — as a team, as a family, we’re right there for you,” Lindor said. “That’s all that matters. We all believe in him. We all believe he’s going to kick cancer’s butt and he’ll be fine.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bieber has helped the Indians surge without Carrasco and Corey Kluber, a two-time Cy Young Award winner who has missed more than two months after a line drive broke his right arm in early May. In seven starts since Carrasco’s last appearance, Bieber is 3-1 with a 3.09 earned run average, holding opponents to a .201 average.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bieber, who was roughly league-average as a rookie last season, made the All-Star team as a replacement for Texas’ Mike Minor, who was ineligible after pitching on Sunday. Indians starter Trevor Bauer, the major league leader in innings pitched, said Bieber was throwing a bit harder this season and had greatly improved his changeup.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“His slider and curveball are largely the same, but his command is impeccable,” Bauer said in a text message Tuesday night. “And he’s getting better pretty rapidly with understanding how to work through lineups multiple times and how to recognize what adjustments hitters are making to his approach within a game. He’s a bright kid, a sponge for information, and he listens. Pretty good combo over all.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bieber, 24, was at his best on Tuesday, fanning Willson Contreras with a fastball, Ketel Marte with a curveball and Ronald Acuna Jr. with a slider. A native of Laguna Hills, Calif., he chose a red Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Trail Boss as his prize because it seemed more mobile than the other option, a white Silverado 2500 HD High Country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I didn’t really know what to think,” Bieber said, when asked for his reaction to winning. “Kind of lost all feeling in my body.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The All-Star Game began in 1933, but only two others had won the M.V.P. in their home park: Alomar here in 1997 and Pedro Martinez in Boston two years later.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That’s incredible,” Bieber said. “I don’t think it’s hit me, and I don’t know when it will.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For baseball, the All-Star stage was a chance to showcase young talent like Bieber and the Mets rookie Pete Alonso, who won Monday’s Home Run Derby and drove in two runs with a single on Tuesday. But it was also a national platform to recognize Tyler Skaggs, the Los Angeles Angels pitcher who died at 27 in his hotel room on the team’s trip to Texas last week. (The cause of death has not been announced.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The league held a moment of silence after player introductions, and most All-Stars wore a black patch with Skaggs’s No. 45 over their hearts. The two Angels at the game, Mike Trout and the injured Tommy La Stella, have not been back to Anaheim since Skaggs died, and wore 45 instead of their usual jersey numbers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Trout said several players thanked him for honoring Skaggs, a popular left-hander who was enjoying his best season in the majors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is all for him,” Trout said. “He always wanted to be an All-Star — and tonight, he was.”</p>',\n",

The bacterial infection, transmitted by a tiny winged insect from China, has evaded all efforts to contain it, decimating Florida’s citrus industry and forcing scores of growers out of business.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a last-ditch attempt to slow the infection, Mr. Petteway revved up his industrial sprayer one recent afternoon and doused the trees with a novel pesticide: antibiotics used to treat syphilis, tuberculosis, urinary tract infections and a number of other illnesses in humans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These bactericides give us hope,” said Mr. Petteway’s son, R. Roy, 33, as he watched his father treat the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.citrusandcattle.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">family’s trees</a>, some of them 50 years old. “Because right now, it’s like we’re doing the doggy paddle without a life preserver and swallowing water.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency has allowed Florida citrus farmers to use the drugs, streptomycin and oxytetracycline, on an emergency basis, but the agency is now significantly expanding their permitted use across 764,000 acres in California, Texas and other citrus-producing states. <!-- -->The agency approved the expanded use<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>despite strenuous objections from the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/safety-health/antimicrobial-resistance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Food and Drug Administration</a> and the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, which warn that the heavy use of antimicrobial drugs in agriculture could spur germs to mutate so they become resistant to the drugs, threatening the lives of millions of people.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The<!-- --> E.P.A. has proposed allowing as much as 650,000 pounds of streptomycin to be sprayed on citrus crops each year. By comparison, Americans annually <!-- -->use<!-- --> 14,000 pounds of aminoglycosides, the class of antibiotics that includes streptomycin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The European Union <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/eu-pesticides-database/public/?event=activesubstance.selection&amp;language=EN\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">has banned</a> the agricultural use of both streptomycin and oxytetracycline.

The desperation is palpable across the state’s sandy midsection, a flat expanse once lushly blanketed with citrus trees, most of them the juice oranges that underpin a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://fred.ifas.ufl.edu/economicimpactanalysis/publications/2016-2017CitrusIndustry/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">$7.2 billion industry</a> employing 50,000 people, about 40,000 fewer than it did two decades ago. These days, the landscape is flecked with abandoned groves and scraggly trees whose elongated yellow leaves are a telltale sign of the disease.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Petteway says the antibiotics have helped bring many of his trees back to life.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They used to have pneumonia, but now it’s like they have a cold,” he said, tugging on the waxy, bright green leaf of a tree thick with embryonic, gumball-size fruit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/deadly-germs-lost-cures?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Read our series on antimicrobial resistance: Deadly Germs, Lost Cures</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A temporary approval of the drugs was issued under President Barack Obama, but in December, under President Trump, the E.P.A. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00878-4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">gave final approval</a> for a much broader use of oxytetracycline. The agency has also proposed the expanded use of streptomycin under similar terms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The decision paves the way for the largest use of medically important antibiotics in cash crops, and it runs counter to other efforts by the federal government to reduce the use of lifesaving antimicrobial drugs. Since 2017, the F.D.A. has banned the use of antibiotics to promote growth in farm animals, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/fda-reports-major-drop-antibiotics-food-animals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a </a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/fda-reports-major-drop-antibiotics-food-animals\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">shift that has led to a 33 percent drop in sales of antibiotics for livestock.</a></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The use of antibiotics on citrus adds a wrinkle to an intensifying debate about whether the heavy use of antimicrobials in agriculture endangers human health by neutering the drugs’ germ-slaying abilities. Much of that debate has focused on livestock farmers, who use 80 percent of antibiotics sold in the United States. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although the research on antibiotic use in crops is not as extensive, scientists say the same dynamic is already playing out with the fungicides that are liberally sprayed on vegetables and flowers across the world. Researchers believe the surge in a drug-resistant lung infection called aspergillosis is associated with agricultural fungicides, and many suspect the drugs are behind the rise of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Candida auris</a>, a deadly fungal infection.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Drug-resistant infections kill 23,000 Americans each year and sicken two million, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">according to the C.D.C.</a> As more germs mutate, the threat is growing. With few new medicines in the pipeline, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/health/un-drug-resistance-antibiotics.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">United Nations</a> says resistant infections could claim 10 million lives globally by 2050, exceeding deaths from cancer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Antibiotics sprayed on crops can affect farm workers or people who directly consume contaminated fruit, but scientists are especially worried that the drugs will cause <!-- -->pathogenic bacteria in the soil to become resistant to the compounds<!-- --> and then find their way to people through groundwater or contaminated food. The other fear is that these bacteria will share their drug-resistant mechanisms with other germs, making them, too, impervious to other kinds of antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In its evaluation for the expanded use of streptomycin, the E.P.A., which largely relied on data from pesticide makers, said the drug quickly dissipated in the environment. Still, the agency noted that there was a “medium” risk from extending the use of such drugs to citrus crops, and it acknowledged the lack of research on whether a massive increase in spraying would affect the bacteria that infect humans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The science of resistance is evolving and there is a high level of uncertainty in how and when resistance occurs,” the agency<!-- --> wrote.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since its arrival in Florida was first confirmed in 2005, citrus greening has infected more than 90 percent of the state’s grapefruit and orange trees. The pathogen is spread by a tiny insect, the Asian citrus psyllid, that infects trees as it feeds on young leaves and stems, but the evidence of disease can take months to emerge. Infected trees prematurely drop their fruit, most of it too bitter for commercial use.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Officials say it is too early to know how many farmers will embrace the spraying of antibiotics. Interviews with a dozen growers and industry officials suggest many farmers are waiting to see whether the regimen is effective.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The E.P.A. acknowledged that the<!-- --> volume of spraying <!-- -->could soar if the scourge reaches California’s commercial orange groves. More than 1,000 trees in the Los Angeles basin, most of them in residential backyards, have been infected so far this year, a doubling from the same period last year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s just a matter of time,” said James Cranney, president of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://ccqc.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">California Citrus Quality Council</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jim Adaskaveg, a plant pathologist at the University of California, Riverside, who does consulting work for the California citrus council, supports using antibiotics in agriculture. He noted that the government has long approved use of smaller amounts of streptomycin and oxytetracycline to manage a destructive bacterial disease that infects apple and pear crops.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Because the E.P.A. prohibits their application 40 days before harvest, he said there was little chance consumers would ingest the drugs. “We’ve been safely using them for decades,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Taw Richardson, the chief executive of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://agrosource.net/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">ArgoSource</a>, which makes the antibiotics used by farmers, said the company has yet to see any resistance in the 14 years since it began selling bactericides. “We don’t take antibiotic resistance lightly,” he said. “The key is to target the things that contribute to resistance and not get distracted by things that don’t.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many scientists disagree with such assessments, noting the mounting resistance to both drugs in humans. They also cite <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180423085415.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">studies</a> suggesting that low concentrations of antibiotics that slowly seep into the environment over an extended period of time can significantly accelerate resistance. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Scientists at the C.D.C. were especially concerned about streptomycin, which can remain in the soil for weeks and is allowed to be sprayed several times a season. As part of its consultation with the F.D.A., the C.D.C. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/pesticides_reduction/pdfs/CDC-study-from-FOIA.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">conducted experiments</a> with the two drugs and found widespread resistance to them. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although the Trump administration has been pressing the E.P.A. to loosen regulations, Nathan Donley, a senior scientist at the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Center for Biological Diversity</a>, said the agency’s pesticides office had a long track record of favoring the interests of chemical and pesticide companies. “What’s in the industry’s best interest will win out over public safety nine times out of 10,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A spokesman for the E.P.A. said the agency had sought to address the C.D.C.’s and F.D.A.’s concerns about antibiotic resistance by ordering additional monitoring and by limiting its approvals to seven years. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, it remains unclear whether the drugs even work on crops. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://microcell.ufl.edu/people/faculty-directory/lorca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Graciela Lorca</a>, a molecular biologist at the University of Florida and an expert on citrus greening, said she is not convinced. In the absence of peer-reviewed studies, she and other researchers have largely relied on anecdotal evidence from growers who have reported some improvement after applying the drugs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Right now it’s a desperate measure for sure,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One recent afternoon, Kenny Sanders drove through his groves of Valencia and Hamin oranges and pointed out ailing trees adorned with the strips of pink tape that mark them for destruction.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That’s the kiss of death,” Mr. Sanders, a former rodeo performer and cattle rustler, said in a jaunty twang. “Used to be if you had 40 acres, you’d drive a Cadillac and send your kids to college. Not anymore.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said he tried using antibiotics for one season, but gave up after seeing little improvement. Cost, he added, was the main reason <!-- -->he<!-- --> didn’t continue spraying.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the meantime, he and many other growers have embraced a range of remedies: tearing out trees at the first sign of disease and planting new stock bred to better withstand the bacteria. He also regularly feeds his trees a precision blend of micronutrients, a coddling he says helps them withstand the disease.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Roy Petteway does all of the above, too, but he believes that the spraying is worth the expense. Soft-spoken and contemplative, he considers himself a environmentalist and though he worries about antibiotic resistance, he puts his faith in the E.P.A. and its determination that the risks of spraying are minimal. He sees it as a stopgap measure that can help his trees survive until researchers develop disease-resistant stock or more effective treatments.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As a fourth-generation grower, Mr. Petteway has more pressing concerns than the relatively abstract threat of antibiotic resistance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These trees are our livelihood and our future,” he said. “And I’ve got to make sure all of this is here for my children and grandchildren.”</p>',\n",

With such a short sojourn, they caught merely a glimpse of the risks associated with survival there.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The prospect of humans staying on the moon for longer stretches has grown, with the Trump administration <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/science/nasa-moon-pence.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">pledging an American return</a> there by 2024, and China planning its first crewed trip to the lunar surface the following decade. That will require work by scientists to further assess the challenges. Here are the most serious risks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Beyond the obvious hazards that arise from a rocket flight, zero-gravity nausea and a risky landing, the moon itself can be deadly.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the Apollo astronauts walked on the moon, the dust clung to their spacesuits, scratched their visors and made their eyes water and their throats sore. It damaged the seals on the boxes of rock and soil that they brought back to Earth. It even smelled like gunpowder inside the lander.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lunar dust, which is composed of shards of silica, is fine like a powder but it cuts like glass. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And that makes it toxic — so much so that Harrison Schmitt complained of “lunar dust hay fever” after his journey on Apollo 17. And yet, in total, Mr. Schmitt spent just 22 hours on the surface. Future astronauts might traverse the lunar landscape for much longer, giving them ample time to breathe in the deadly dust.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GH000125\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">recent study</a> even suggests that prolonged exposure could lead to more serious effects, like bronchitis or cancer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then there is the moon’s wrinkled surface — a topography that might be more threatening than rugged terrain on Earth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“A lot of people think the moon is like a desert, but it’s actually more like an ocean,” Dr. Richard Scheuring, a flight surgeon at NASA, said. “It has a very undulating surface, like sea swells.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Throw in the intense contrast between light and dark — unlike anything we see here on Earth — and those changes in the terrain can play tricks on your eyes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Pete Conrad and Alan Bean landed on the moon during the Apollo 12 mission, one of their tasks was to enter the 650-foot-wide Surveyor Crater. But as they skirted its rim, searching for the best path down, they informed Houston that the crater was far too steep.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Topographic maps, however, revealed an easy, 21-degree slope. The sharp shadows had fooled the astronauts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That means the act of simply walking around on the moon might be perilous.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The moon might also be rippling. A recent study suggests that our <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0362-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">lunar neighbor is tectonically active</a>, with moonquakes as large as 5.5-magnitude earthquakes. That is bad news for future lunar bases, which might be vulnerable to the shaking.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sleep may not come easy on the moon. Our body clocks are wound by light exposure, as day sweeps to night once every 24 hours. But on the moon, that same shift occurs once every 28 days.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An astronaut’s circadian rhythm is going to be quite baffled. And the stakes are high. On Earth, sleep deprivation makes us fuzzy, but on the moon it is plain dangerous.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Sleep is the biggest thing to protect for a crew member,” Albert Holland, a NASA psychologist, said. Without it, he added, astronauts might find themselves unable to face life-threatening emergencies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When NASA sent the Curiosity rover hurtling to Mars in 2011, it packed a stow away: an instrument designed to measure the radiation throughout the trek.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The results confirmed that any astronauts beyond Earth’s protective atmosphere and magnetic field would receive a hefty dose of radiation — one that is more than 200 times higher than levels on Earth. This is perhaps the biggest challenge.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even aboard the International Space Station, which is so close to Earth that it is somewhat shielded, radiation levels are high — so high that when astronauts close their eyes, they often see flashes of light as cosmic rays pass through their optic nerve.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s an instantaneous reminder of the fact that those high-energy particles are going through your whole body — not just through your optic nerve,” said Chris Hadfield, a Canadian astronaut who commanded the station in 2013. “And it’s a stark reminder that you’re no longer under the protective womb of the planet that nurtured us.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those cosmic rays have the power to charge through both strands of DNA, snapping them in two and causing cancer. In addition, a dose of long-term radiation <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep34774#abstract\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">affects your cognitive abilities</a> — resulting in dementia, memory deficits, anxiety, depression and impaired decision-making.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Radiation is not the only killer from deep space. On Jan. 20, when stargazers across the Western Hemisphere watched a lunar eclipse, some saw <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/science/lunar-eclipse-meteor-moon.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a flash of light</a> strike the moon’s reddened surface. A small, fast-moving meteoroid had slammed into the moon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although the moon is a library of impact events, the flash was a reminder that collisions still occur today. <!-- -->Because the moon lacks an atmosphere<!-- -->, the strikes are hard and fast<!-- -->, posing a serious hazard for future astronauts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Current spacesuits can block a 9-millimeter round, Dr. Scheuring said, “but a micrometeorite could be going a lot faster and it could be a lot bigger.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A trip will be possible only if scientists find ways to mitigate these challenges. <!-- -->And although a lunar habitat may never provide the protective bubble we take for granted on Earth, there may be <!-- -->a variety of options for safer lunar living.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To protect against lunar dust, Dorit Donoviel, the director of NASA’s Translational Research Institute for Space Health, said that any future lunar habitat would need filters and a strong airflow so that the astronauts would not breathe in the sharp silica. And Dr. Scheuring added that such a habitat would need a strong airlock where astronauts could clean off the dust before entering the main living area.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The habitat would also need to be equipped with lights to help counter the effects of sleep deprivation. Similar lights have already been installed on the space station, where individual sleeping compartments can be darkened to simulate night.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Just what that lunar habitat will look like remains a tough question, in part because radiation can penetrate most materials now used in space construction. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If living on the moon’s surface for a sustained period is necessary, some experts have proposed covering shelters in a thick layer of water, because hydrogen works as a shield.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another solution seems only natural: building living quarters underground. The lava tubes carved by ancient volcanic activity could potentially be turned into spacious living spaces. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">All of these hazards may seem worth it to anyone willing to be a moon dweller.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Anything in life involves some risk,” Mr. Hadfield said. “Often the more interesting and the more unusual the things you do with your life, the greater the inherent risk.”</p>',\n",

Then, around 90 A.D., Plutarch wrote that those blemishes were the shadows of mountains and valleys and that the moon must be habitable. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By no means did everyone agree, but ignorance is seldom bliss. Faced with an unanswerable question, our species generally comes up with theories, guesses, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.history.com/news/7-unusual-myths-and-theories-about-the-moon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">myths</a> and fantasies. Telescopes made viewing more precise, and photography did even better, but though no living creatures showed up, the notion that they might would not die. After World War II, one of several rumors was that the Germans had established a secret facility on the moon, and some even speculated that Hitler had faked his own death and lived out his days beneath the lunar surface.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A new exhibition, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2019/apollos-muse-moon-photography\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">“Apollo’s Muse: The Moon in the Age of Photography,”</a> at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is a journey through an uncommon history, the history of representations of the moon across four centuries. This outsize and beautifully installed revelation of persistent astronomical searches is a trailblazing marriage of science and art — 300 images and objects (a telescope, a photograph used as a fire screen, two moon globes, Hasselblad cameras used by astronauts), plus film excerpts. The images shine a bright light on astronomers’ unstoppable pursuit of knowledge as well as on technological advances, artistic responses and fantasy, and also a generous serving of unabashed cuteness. The show amounts to a testament to the human drive to know and explore, and it quietly affirms the growing influence of visual representations of the moon from the invention of the telescope <!-- -->through the<!-- --> first <!-- -->manned moon landing 50 years ago<!-- -->. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mia Fineman, <!-- -->the curator in the department of photographs at the Met<!-- -->, organized “Apollo’s Muse” with Beth Saunders, curator and <!-- -->head of special collections<!-- --> at <!-- -->the Albin O. Kuhn Library and Gallery at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County,<!-- --> and they wrote essays for its informative catalog. (Apollo, god of the sun, never had a muse; he was leader of the nine muses. NASA, of course, wasn’t going to the sun. The moon landing project might have been named after Diana, goddess of the moon.) </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After 1608, when the telescope was invented, the moon seemed approachable. In 1609, Galileo drew its first closely observed portraits: maps of a portion of the surface. The English mathematician and astronomer <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/harriot.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Thomas Harriot</a> made telescopic observations a bit earlier than Galileo, but his were not published until later, and he could not explain the “strange spottedness” he saw. Galileo, expertly trained in perspective and art, realized that the “spottedness” was actually the shadows of mountains. His published drawings, two of which are included in the exhibition, represent the dawn of modern astronomy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The 17th century brought to human vision both extremely distant and extremely tiny objects, as telescopes rapidly improved and the power of microscopes, invented at the end of the previous century, vastly increased. Accomplished artists collaborated to provide scientists and the public ever more detailed and delectable illustrations of information obtained <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">au clair de la lune</em>. Johannes Hevelius’s highly successful Selenography — a lunar atlas published in 1647 and named for Selene, the moon goddess in Greek mythology — is thought to be the first book entirely dedicated to the moon. Hevelius surrounded one lunar map with baroque flourishes: cherubs<!-- --> <!-- -->brandishing pronouncements<!-- -->, looking through telescopes or studiously drawing<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Astronomers drew what they saw; artists made the drawings better. But some images were of little use to astronomers without good scientific texts, and most were not widely seen by anyone but scientists. The French artist <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/393543\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Claude Mellan’s 1635 engravings</a> were not simply beautiful but also so accurate that they were not surpassed until two centuries later. In 1805, the British portraitist and amateur astronomer John Russell made a superb <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://newatlas.com/science-technology-auction-report/46858/#p439586\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">engraving of the moon titled “</a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://newatlas.com/science-technology-auction-report/46858/#p439586\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Lunar Planisphere, Flat Light</a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://newatlas.com/science-technology-auction-report/46858/#p439586\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">,”</a> showing the moon not as we see it but rather in flat, even light. It’s a choice that reflected Russell’s belief that an artist should “correct’’ nature in order to produce an ideal. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The idea that earth’s mysterious companion might be inhabited kept being broached by imaginative people, mistaken people and hoaxers. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The name of Sir John Herschel, a noted British astronomer, was slyly stolen in 1835 by The New York Sun<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em>for the sensational “great moon hoax,” which reported that Sir John had o<!-- -->bserved houses, roads and sophisticated cities<!-- --> on the lunar surface. The story was reprinted across Europe, and a wide <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/great-moon-hoax-was-simply-sign-its-time-180955761/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">international audience</a> ecstatically bought both paper and hoax.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The invention of photography four years later meant that more accurate and believable imagery was about to take center stage. “Apollo’s Muse” has several of the earliest photographs of the moon, including <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://lightsinthedark.com/2016/03/23/this-is-the-oldest-surviving-photo-of-the-moon/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">John William Draper’s remarkable 1840 daguerreotype</a> — exposure time: a half-hour. (Daguerreotypes required more light than the moon produced, hence the long exposure, during which the earth and moon both moved.) Draper’s photograph gives us a glimpse into a rare moment of double discovery, comparable to Galileo’s: a more precise understanding of the moon’s surface, and one obtained with an instrument able to see more accurately than the eye. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Until mid-19th century, photographs could be reproduced only with great difficulty, and photography by the light of the moon as the earth rotated was no mean feat, so for years the public saw less than visitors to the Met will. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The British astronomer <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.amusingplanet.com/2018/12/james-nasmyths-fake-lunar-photographs.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">James Nasmyth</a>, despairing of photography’s power to capture the minutiae and three-dimensionality he saw through his scope, made detailed plaster casts. In 1874, his photographs of his artful stand-ins for the moon were published and lauded as the most “truthful” representations ever seen. So much for photography’s reputation for veracity. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In fact, photography did not simply run artistry out of town. As late as 1882, the French astronomer Étienne Léopold Trouvelot, working at the Harvard College Observatory, believed that photography had limitations that art did not. He published “The Trouvelot Astronomical <!-- -->Drawings<!-- --> Manual,<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">” </em>illustrated with stunningly drawn prints of craters on the moon and an eclipse of the sun. His scientific drawings were published in a large portfolio and collected; public interest in science was growing. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">New and more accurate information does not always move minds. (Consider the Flat Earth Society.) Technological and scientific advances never produced evidence of lunar inhabitants, but the moon was too fascinating to be held back by mere science. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Literary voyages to our constant companion existed long before Jules Verne’s influential <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKZf5Ycf6nc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">“From the Earth to the Moon” (1865).</a> Illustrations included humanoids and fanciful animals, but more charming was the first science fiction movie, Georges Méliès’s<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0000417/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> “Le Voyage Dans la Lune”</a> (“A Trip to the Moon”), from 1902.

A colorized excerpt (as well as clips from <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/arts/fritz-lang-woman-in-the-moon.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">Fritz Lang’s “Woman in the Moon,”</a> from 1931<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019901/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">,</a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em>and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042393/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Irving Pichel’s “Destination Moon,”</a> from 1950) plays in the exhibition. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the early 20th century, the moon had become cuddly. Portrait studios acquired sturdy, smiling crescent moons (and at least one that was implacably grumpy). Nudes, lovers, friends, families and pranksters sat on the crescent curve to be immortalized on postcards.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the time NASA came along, the moon was a pretty serious matter again. Before the launch of Apollo 11, on July 16, 1969, cameras were surveying the moon from unmanned Lunar Orbiters, looking for a landing site. (Spy satellites had already taken photographs, and in 1966, Lunar Orbiter 1 took a picture of Earthrise two years before the astronaut William Anders took the more famous image.) Some of the photographs taken from 239,000 miles away were converted into three-dimensional moonscapes and carefully studied for a landing site, but Neil Armstrong eventually, and breathtakingly, used his eyes to find a safer landing spot than the one to which he had been directed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> The exhibition usefully supplies some Soviet propaganda photographs — the first dogs in space, the first woman <!-- -->in space<!-- --> — that were stoking popular support for their outstanding space achievements when the United States was still feverishly working to surpass them. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These proved to be forerunners to the hugely successful American public relations campaign that followed the first moon landing. Images of the Apollo 11 astronauts — <!-- -->Buzz Aldrin walking near the lunar module, for example, or standing by the American flag — still resonate 50 years later. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Critics initially dismissed the Apollo program as a “moondoggle.” After Apollo 11 landed, a few declared it a fake. But Americans generally saw it as an affirmation of national greatness after a decade of tragedy, upheaval and Cold War, and the whole world thrilled to this intimate encounter with the moon, which had been aloof since something like forever.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Perhaps nothing can live up to the moon landing. Less exciting is the artistic response in the last gallery of the show. In 1962, the NASA administrator James Webb and the artist James Dean founded the NASA Art Program. A NASA website suggests one reason: “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/nasaartfeature.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">An artist also could bring something that engineers and managers </a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/nasaartfeature.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">loathe</a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/nasaartfeature.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> to admit to: emotion</a>.”<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The program commissioned well-known artists including Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol, all of whom made tiny drawings in 1969 for a small ceramic <!-- -->wafer<!-- --> that was attached to the Apollo 12 spacecraft and left on the moon. (It has become known as the Moon Museum.)

       " 'auschwitz-daniel-libeskind': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">OSWIECIM, Poland — The letter to Daniel Libeskind’s father arrived shortly after the war ended. His sister, Rozia, informed him that his family was dead. She was the only one of 10 siblings to survive Auschwitz. Over three handwritten pages in Yiddish, she detailed the horrors they endured.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“As I write these words,” she concluded, “who will believe what I am telling you?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the world’s largest factory of death approaches, Mr. Libeskind, the architect and artist, returned to the site of his family’s destruction, doing his part to be sure that her words — and the words of other witnesses — are both believed and not forgotten.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Working with the photographer Caryl Englander and the curator Henri Lustiger Thaler of the Amud Aish Memorial Museum in Brooklyn, Mr. Libeskind was at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum on Monday to open a new temporary exhibit — “Through the Lens of Faith” — near the entrance to the camp.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is a strange and remarkable experience for me,” Mr. Libeskind said the day before the exhibit opened.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a wide-ranging conversation that touched on faith, family, memory, politics and art, Mr. Libeskind talked about the challenge for an artist of making a statement on a site whose horrors have been preserved unadorned, so they can speak for themselves. And, in fact, Mr. Libeskind’s original design — a larger structure like a cathedral with seating for visitors — was rejected as “too artistic.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“At first, I didn’t really understand that,” he said. “You need to have art to communicate an idea.” But he came to see that nothing he did should take away the focus from the place itself. “Whatever you do, you have to communicate where you are,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Libeskind also reflected on what it meant to take part in a project so deeply personal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Born in a homeless shelter in the industrial city of Lodz in 1946, Mr. Libeskind spent his childhood in the postwar ruins of Poland under the heel of communist rule. He returned as one of the world’s most well-known architects, having worked on <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/arts/design/holocaust-memorial-is-closer-to-reality-in-amsterdam.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">projects</a> around the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2009/05/01/arts/20090501_MUSE_SLIDESHOW_index.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">world</a>, including the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/opinion/100000001045854/daniel-libeskind-from-the-ashes.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">complicated assignment</a> of overseeing the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/20/arts/architecture-the-incredible-shrinking-daniel-libeskind.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">rebuilding project</a> at ground zero after the destruction of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That makes him no stranger to dealing with the complicated — and competing — demands that come with working on a site that is also a graveyard. His work at Auschwitz, though, comes at a particularly <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/world/europe/poland-death-camp-law.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer\" title=\"\">challenging moment</a>, both for the institution and for the task of preserving historical memory.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the last living witnesses of the Holocaust die, there has been a troubling rise in anti-Semitism across the continent. As it has, political parties from Budapest to Rome have grown ever more bold in their desire to control the narrative of the past as a weapon in the present.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Poland is at the center of these political crosscurrents, and so the past year has been a tumultuous one for the Auschwitz museum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the government passed a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/world/europe/poland-israel-holocaust-law.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer\" title=\"\">broadly written law</a> last year making it illegal to accuse the Polish nation of complicity in the Holocaust, setting off outrage in both the United States and Israel, the museum found itself thrust uncomfortably into the middle of the maelstrom. The law <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/world/europe/poland-holocaust-law.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">was later weakened</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the director of the museum, Piotr M.A. Cywinski, came under attack from conservative organizations. He was accused of “threatening” Polish historical memory, and around 10,000 people signed a petition calling for his firing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pawel Sawicki, a spokesman for the museum, said that the institution would withstand any political pressure. Still, the museum faces a tricky balancing act: It must commemorate an unspeakable atrocity without appearing to claim responsibility for it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many Poles, whatever their political beliefs, fear that as time goes by, the death camp will become more associated with Poland than with the Germans who ran it. Unlike many of its neighbors, Poland did not to establish a collaborationist government during the war.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To address those concerns, a new exhibit will do more to tell this story. It is part of the largest renovation of the museum since its founding, an 11-year project to be completed in 2025. With the number of people visiting every year continuing to grow — from 500,000 in 2000 to more than two million last year — the museum will do the work without closing to the public.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The new exhibition will be to a large extent based on the experience of the old exhibition, in particular as far as such aspects as its dignity, tranquillity, certain austerity and minimalism are concerned,” Mr. Cywinski said in a statement. “It will still aim at showing rather than narrating.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The museum opened in 1947, and the main exhibits that visitors see date to 1955. They include mountains of hair, encased behind glass, of the victims who died in the gas chambers, as well as the piles of shoes, the luggage still emblazoned with family names, the personal items like eyeglasses and toothbrushes, which are all intimately associated with the memorial.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many of the exhibits were created by former inmates, and aside from some <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/arts/international/at-auschwitz-birkenau-preserving-a-site-and-a-ghastly-inventory.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">remarkable preservation work</a>, remain largely unchanged.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Mr. Libeskind was a child, he said, his parents took him to the museum. Seeing the exhibits again for the first time after some seven decades was a powerful experience.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The memories came flooding back,” Mr. Libeskind, 73, said as he walked between the red brick barracks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the outbreak of the war, his parents — Dora and Nachman — had not yet met. Both fled east, only to be arrested by Soviet forces. HIs father was sent to a labor camp and his mother to Siberia. It was only after a deal was reached between Stalin and the Allied forces allowing for Polish prisoners to be freed in 1943 that the two met.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They returned to Poland after the war, and the scale of the genocide was made clear by a simple fact: None of their family was there anymore.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We lived in the radiation of the Holocaust,” said Mr. Libeskind.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But he also lived under a new kind of oppression. Communist rule, he said, would be a different sort of prison.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His family left in 1957, during one of two major purges of Jews in the postwar years. Of the 3.5 million Jews who lived in Poland before the war, three million were murdered. An estimated 300,000 tried to return after the war. But by 1968, only around 20,000 remained.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Ms. Englander and Mr. Lustiger Thaler approached Mr. Libeskind about doing a project at Auschwitz related to faith, he did not hesitate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Often, the stories of survivors of the camps include recollections of lost faith. How, after all, could there be a god who would allow such a thing to happen?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the new exhibit, which is the result of three years of research, focuses on the stories of those who somehow managed to keep their faith or find it again after the war. It includes interviews with 18 Jewish survivors, two Polish Catholics and one Roma Sinti man.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Englander photographed each person, hoping to show their vitality. Mr. Lustiger Thaler chose excerpts from the interviews, 200 words to try to capture the essence of their story. It was left to Mr. Libeskind to design an exhibit that translated that somewhat abstract notion into reality.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He designed a series of vertical steel panels to form a path leading to the entrance of the museum. Each panel contains a recessed section where Ms. Englander’s portraits are displayed. In front is dark glass, etched with the words chosen by Mr. Lustiger Thaler, whose family was also from Poland and was nearly completely wiped out in the Holocaust.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Lustiger Thaler called the exhibit “testimony to the resiliency of the human spirit.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Libeskind agreed, and went further: He said he was confident that “manipulating memory is doomed to failure.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The next day, standing next to the ruins of one of the gas chambers at Birkenau, blown up by Nazi soldiers hoping to eliminate traces of their crimes, Mr. Libeskind grew silent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He walked off alone with his thoughts, staring down the train tracks that brought so many members of his family to their death. After a few minutes, he turned and walked out of the camp.</p>',\n",

       " 'bird-amber-toe': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some 99 million years ago, a small animal with a weird elongated <!-- -->toe<!-- --> died and became partially entombed in amber. Its lower leg and foot remained undisturbed in the hardened tree resin until amber miners eventually discovered the fossil in Myanmar’s Hukawng Valley in 2014.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The preserved toe measures less than half an inch from knuckle to claw-tip, making it 41 percent longer than the next longest digit on the animal’s foot. When traders showed the curious specimen to <!-- -->Chen Guang<!-- -->, a curator at China’s Hupoge Amber Museum, they suggested that it probably belonged to an extinct lizard.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Chen thought that the remains looked more like an avian species, so he looped in Lida Xing, a paleontologist at China University of Geosciences who specializes in Cretaceous birds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was very surprised at the time,” Dr. Xing said, recalling that the fossil was “undoubtedly the claw of a bird.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A handful of Cretaceous bird fossils have been found in Burmese amber, but this is the first to be identified as a new species.

Its foot also sported an unusual layer of bristled feathers, “unlike any adult bird known today,” according to Jingmai O’Connor, a co-author and paleontologist at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Long toes are associated with arboreal animals that need a firm grip on tree branches. The bristles suggest that the bird’s foot also had a sophisticated sensory system. Dr. Xing’s team speculated that E. chenguangi may have used the long, sensitive digit to probe cracks in trees for insects and grubs, just as the aye-aye lemur uses a slim finger to extract food in modern Madagascar.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These sorts of special adaptations may have helped propel Enantiornithes to evolutionary success during the age of dinosaurs. At that time, Enantiornithes overshadowed Neornithes, the group that contains all modern avian species. But that abruptly changed when a huge asteroid hit Earth 66 million years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Enantiornithes were wiped out along with the non-avian dinosaurs, while Neornithes went on to become the diverse group of birds — from ostriches to penguins, eagles to hummingbirds — that currently inhabits our planet.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“<!-- -->Enantiornithines<!-- --> were good enough to survive and dominate in the Cretaceous but maybe not good enough to make it through the mass extinction,” Dr. O’Connor said. She noted that the faster maturation cycles and more efficient digestive systems of Neornithes may have given them an edge.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Enantiornithines may no longer be with us, but this amber fossil has provided a sepia-toned snapshot of their lives and their world.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While many fossils trapped in amber like this one are reshaping our understanding of the distant past, they may also be <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/05/fossils-burmese-amber-offer-exquisite-view-dinosaur-times-and-ethical-minefield\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">amplifying intractable social tensions</a> in Myanmar in the present.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Some of these specimens have big price tags, and that money might in some cases help fund armed conflict in Myanmar between the government and militias,” said Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These fossils are hugely important, and the scientists studying them have done an excellent job, but I want to be sure that these <!-- -->fossils were not incidentally complicit in human suffering.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. O’Connor agreed that she and her colleagues had growing awareness about ethical problems with the amber trade, but said, “It’s the conflict that has dragged the amber into it, not the other way around.”</p>',\n",

       " 'border-migrants-remain-mexico': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">SAN DIEGO — At its peak, the nonprofit shelter run by Jewish Family Service of San Diego held more than 300 migrants dropped off by United States immigration authorities after they crossed the border from Mexico. Some days this spring were so busy that new arrivals had to be sent to overflow sites.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, the shelter is almost eerily empty. The number of people arriving there has plunged in recent weeks amid a precipitous decline in arrivals along the southern border, where the Department of Homeland Security said that apprehensions <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/border-arrests-homeland-security.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">dropped 28 percent</a> in June.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While migrant arrivals typically decline as the hot, hazardous summer months set in, the Department of Homeland Security said the drop in June was much larger than the 11 percent drop in June of last year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The difference suggested that the Trump administration’s long push to curtail the arrival of migrants at the southern border is finally showing results.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since he took office, President Trump has made it a cornerstone of his administration to halt the flow of undocumented migrants, expanding security fencing, slowing processing at ports of entry and locking up record numbers of migrants.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The administration’s latest policies have gone a step further. The threat of tariffs helped push Mexico to deploy security forces on its own southern border, curtailing the flow of migrants from neighboring Guatemala.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A second initiative has forced many migrants to return to Mexico to await the outcome of their asylum or deportation cases in American immigration courts. More than 18,000 migrants, including asylum seekers, have been returned to Tijuana and other Mexican cities since the policy was put into place, according to Mexico’s National Migration Institute.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These initiatives are making an impact,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the nonprofit shelter here in San Diego, the effects have been drastic. On Friday of last week, not a single migrant arrived — a first for the facility since it opened in October.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have been startled by the stark decline that happened virtually overnight,” said Kate Clark, senior director of immigration services at the shelter. “U.S. immigration authorities are not bringing families who have been processed to the shelter because they are returning them to Mexico.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[Sign up for our daily newsletter about news from California </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\" title=\"\">here</a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Tijuana, by contrast, is still full of migrants — many of them turned back at the border under the Trump administration’s “Remain in Mexico” program.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The United States policy to return people to Mexico and the pressure on Mexico to stop the migration are having a big impact,” said Daniel Bribiescas, an immigration lawyer in Tijuana.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Instituto Madre Asunta, a shelter for migrant families just south of the border, has for several weeks packed in more than three times the number of people it is designed to accommodate. Mothers and children from Central America and Haiti have been sleeping in a classroom converted into a dormitory, many atop mattresses on the floor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re doing our best to sleep 140 people but we only have 44 beds,” said Adelia Contini, the nun who runs the facility, which is in a residential neighborhood with a shelter for fathers and children that was also over capacity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some families have been at the Madre Asunta shelter for months, after American immigration authorities sent them to Mexico with instructions to show up at the San Ysidro, Calif., port of entry at dawn on the day of their immigration hearing to be transported to court.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mexico’s own heightened border security is also having an effect. To make good on a deal struck with Mr. Trump last month to avert trade tariffs, more than 20,000 Mexican security forces, including members of the newly formed National Guard, have been <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/world/americas/mexico-guatemala-border.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">deployed throughout the country’s southern and northern border states</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Mexican authorities have been trying to plug well-known but illegal crossing points along their southern border, and have set up checkpoints along major highways to intercept vehicles carrying undocumented migrants. In Tijuana, officers have been stopping and arresting migrants who do not have papers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Department of Homeland Security said there had been a “substantial increase” in the number of interdictions on Mexico’s southern border.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, a Customs and Border Protection official said Mexico’s deployment of forces on its northern frontier had helped stop “large groups” of migrants before they could cross into the United States. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said agents had apprehended 15 groups of 100 or more migrants in June, down from 48 such groups in May.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I would attribute to Mexico for making some difference,” the official said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The decline in arrivals in June has helped reduce overcrowding at border facilities. About 200 children are currently being held in Border Patrol centers, compared with roughly 2,700 in May, the official said. He said a $4.6 billion border aid package approved last month by Congress, which gave about $3 billion to the Department of Health and Human Services, had allowed that agency to more quickly move children out of Border Patrol facilities and into its own, better-equipped shelters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With more Central Americans stuck in Mexico and hoping to go home, the International Organization for Migration began last week to provide free bus service from Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, to Guatemala and Honduras. Buses left last week carrying 67 migrants back home. A second group of 70 boarded buses on Tuesday. The agency plans to begin offering a similar bus service from Tijuana in the coming days.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">None of those on the I.O.M. buses said they had been seeking asylum in the United States, according to Christopher Gascon, the agency’s chief of mission in Mexico.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dozens of migrants who said they were considering returning home jammed a small travel agency in Tijuana on Monday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jenaro Mejia, 54, an asylum seeker from Honduras, said his first court hearing in the United States was set for Aug. 5. “We don’t know if we will win asylum or not,” he said. Faced with the prospect of languishing for several more months in Mexico, Mr. Mejia said he planned to go home and would not return. “We have contacted family to buy us tickets,” said Mr. Mejia, as his son Fabio, 15, bleary-eyed from exhaustion, stood by his side.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But most migrants said they could not afford the 3,000 pesos, or about $155, for a private, one-way bus ticket back to Central America; their money had already gone to smugglers who guided them to the United States. “Some of us sold our land to realize the dream of coming here. We don’t have the money for a ticket home,” said Carlos Mauricio López, a Guatemalan migrant whose first court hearing was set for Oct. 4.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Critics have said that the Remain in Mexico policy endangers migrants who fled violence in their home countries, because Mexican border cities are also often unsafe. In addition, the program makes it difficult for migrants to secure an American lawyer to represent them before an immigration judge, undermining their ability to petition for asylum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the shelter in San Diego, only nationals from countries like India, China and Russia, whose citizens are not subjected to the Remain in Mexico policy, continue to trickle in, Ms. Clark said. The only exceptions to the policy among Latin Americans are those who have a child or another family member with a serious medical issue. A Honduran man who identified himself only as Jonnie arrived with his 4-year-old girl, who had advanced scoliosis. He said she was in critical need of surgery.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Elsewhere along the Mexican side of the border, there were also signs that fewer migrants were arriving from the south.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Nuevo Laredo, on the Mexican side of the border opposite Laredo, Tex., the number of residents in the half-dozen migrant shelters in the city has dropped sharply in recent weeks, after months of operating well above capacity. At the Casa del Migrante Nazareth, the number of migrants, nearly all of them intending to seek asylum in the United States, has hovered around 100 in recent days, well below the peak of 290 at the beginning of May.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Casa del Migrante Amar, another shelter in the city, was housing about 100 migrants on Wednesday, about a fifth of the number that crammed the center for weeks earlier this year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Shelter operators said there could be several reasons for the drop, including stricter occupancy limits imposed by the shelters, and the city’s reputation for being a dangerous place, which has perhaps compelled migrants to head to other border cities. But some advocates here also said it was possible that the joint Mexico-United States crackdown on undocumented migration could be slowing the flow.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It could be dissuading migrants,” Father Julio López, who runs the Casa del Migrante Nazareth, said of the new bilateral strategies. They might be biding their time in their home countries or elsewhere on the migrant trail, he said, “waiting to see what will happen.”</p>',\n",

So I asked him to tell us about what we might<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>expect here in the Golden State:</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As a reporter in Denver, I’ve heard endless jokes about Denver being a different kind of Mile High City and gotten accustomed to pointing curious visitors to dispensaries. The lessons of Colorado’s ups and downs with regulated marijuana have plenty to teach California as it tries to wrap its arms around the unintended consequences of legalization.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some in Colorado’s marijuana industry feel as if the focus of the legalization debate is veering away from the Rockies and toward California. California is already a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://bdsanalytics.com/the-2018-california-cannabis-marketplace-in-review/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">vastly larger market </a>— about $2.5 billion in sales last year, compared with Colorado’s $1.5 billion.

In California, a huge surplus is fueling an illicit market of illegal shops and backcountry pot farms. In Colorado, law enforcement is still carrying out huge raids on traffickers who are growing marijuana in homes or industrial spaces and shipping it out of state to sell.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After five years of legalization, there has not been an increase in teenage marijuana use in Colorado. That’s good news to educators and public-health officials, and it’s a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ocregister.com/2018/08/22/survey-fewer-california-teens-use-marijuana-even-as-legalization-kicks-in/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">number</a> many will be watching in California.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Colorado’s experiment with recreational weed shows that voting for legalization is just the beginning. Colorado had to overhaul the rules about the shape, packaging and marking on edibles over concerns they were falling into <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marijuana-poisoning-in-kids-rose-after-recreational-use-legalized-in-colorado/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">children’s hands</a>.

       " 'cameron-boyce-death-epilepsy': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The actor Cameron Boyce, 20, who died on Saturday, had epilepsy, and his death was caused by a seizure that occurred during his sleep, his family said in a statement. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Boyce starred in shows on the Disney Channel, including “Descendants” and “Jessie,” and appeared in a number of movies. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Cameron’s tragic passing was due to a seizure as a result of an ongoing medical condition, and that condition was epilepsy,” a Boyce <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/disney-channel-star-cameron-boyce-suffered-epilepsy-family/story?id=64230987\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">family spokesperson told ABC New</a>s in a statement on Tuesday night. The Los Angeles County coroner’s office conducted an autopsy, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://mec.lacounty.gov/2019/press-releases/cameron-boyce/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">but said it was awaiting the results of additional tests before determining an official cause of death. </a></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The most likely cause of his death was Sudep, or <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/epilepsy/about/sudep/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">sudden unexpected death in epilepsy,</a> said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, director of NYU Langone’s Comprehensive Epilepsy Center in Manhattan. He was not involved in Mr. Boyce’s care.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Each year, about one in 1,000 people with epilepsy die from this disorder. In the United States, there are about 2,600 such deaths a year, though neurologists suspect that figure is an undercount.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It can happen to anyone with epilepsy,” Dr. Devinsky said. “Even the first seizure could be the last one. The more uncontrolled the seizures, the more severe, and the more they occur in sleep, the higher the risk.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About 70 percent of cases occur during sleep, and the people are often found facedown in bed. Usually, they have been sleeping alone. The probable cause of death is that the person stops breathing. A severe seizure can temporarily shut down the brain, including the centers that control respiration, Dr. Devinsky said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If that happens when a person is sleeping, and sometimes the seizure causes the person to end up face down, then it’s a perfect storm,” he said, adding that seizures can also impair the arousal reflex, which normally causes people to struggle for breath and move around if their air supply is blocked.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If someone else is present and can roll the person over, call out and try to rouse them, “that can be lifesaving,” Dr. Devinsky said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Information about epilepsy and first aid for seizures is available from the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.epilepsy.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Epilepsy Foundation</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/23/health/a-risk-for-sudden-death-in-epilepsy-that-often-goes-unmentioned.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">doctors do not warn patients</a> and their families about Sudep. The philosophy seems to be, why share such terrifying news when they can’t do anything about it?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The risk of Sudep cannot be eliminated, but there are some things that patients and their families can do to lower it, Dr. Devinsky said. One is to be extremely vigilant about taking medicines to control seizures.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you miss one single dose, you can die,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sleep deprivation can bring on seizures, and so can alcohol, particularly in excess.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Monitoring devices to detect seizures during the night — worn on the arm like a watch, or placed under the mattress — can alert a relative or housemate of a problem. But that precaution would not help people who live alone. It is not known whether setting off a loud alarm in the bedroom could help rouse a person who has had a seizure.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“A great deficiency in American health care at this time is that doctors don’t warn patients about this,” Dr. Devinsky said. “The vast majority of families have never heard about this as a possibility, which is unconscionable. It is something that every patient should be talked to about.”</p>',\n",

The doctor explained that Stephanie Spoor, 64, had contracted a “rare, very rare, fungus.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The physician said the fungus was called Candida auris, and it appeared to have entered her bloodstream through a catheter or other intravenous line during her treatment. Mr. Spoor sent a text to the couple’s four children.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Hey guys, I’m very sorry to do this via text but you need to know and not fair to wait until all of us are together,” he wrote. “The fungus mom has is the worst possible and can be terminal.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added: “It is a day to day issue so I don’t have any more answers or info at this time.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Spoor, 67, an executive at a plumbing equipment company, wasn’t the only one with few answers. C. auris, a germ that typically is resistant to major antifungal medications, has been quietly confounding doctors, hospitals and infectious disease scientists around the world.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">First identified in the ear of a woman in Japan in 2009 (“auris” is Latin for “ear”), the germ has<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> spread around the globe</a>, mostly appearing in hospitals and nursing homes, where it afflicts people with weakened immune systems.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nearly 600 cases of C. auris <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/candida-auris/tracking-c-auris.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">have been reported</a> in the United States, the majority of them in New York, New Jersey and Illinois. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of people who contract the illness die within 90 days. But the true death rate is difficult to quantify because most patients have other medical conditions and their deaths may be attributed to other causes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About 90 percent of C. auris strains are resistant to at least one drug, and 30 percent are resistant to two or more of the three major classes of antifungal drugs. However, on Tuesday, the C.D.C. confirmed that it has learned in the last month of the first known cases in the United States of so-called “pan-resistant” C. auris — a strain resistant to all major antifungals, said Dr. Tom Chiller, head of the agency’s fungal division, in an interview.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Such cases have been seen in several countries, including India and South Africa, but the two new cases, from New York State, have not been reported previously. Dr. Chiller said that it appeared that, in each case, the germ evolved during treatment and became pan-resistant, confirming a fear that the infection will continue to develop more effective defenses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s happening and it’s going to happen,” Dr. Chiller said. “That’s why we need to remain vigilant and rapidly identify and control these infections.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It often has been hard to gather details about the path of C. auris because hospitals and nursing homes have been unwilling to publicly disclose outbreaks or discuss cases, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/health/candida-auris-hospitals-drug-resistant.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">creating a culture of secrecy</a> around the infection. States have kept confidential the locations of hospitals where outbreaks have occurred, citing patient confidentiality and a risk of unnecessarily scaring the public.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor’s family contacted The New York Times to share details of her case after reading <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">an article in the newspaper about the emergence of C. auris</a> and the growing threat of drug resistant infections. Her experience sheds some light on the experience of dealing with the new health threat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Northwestern Memorial has not issued any public announcement that it had cases of C. auris. The Illinois Department of Public Health confirmed Ms. Spoor’s case after the family gave officials permission to discuss it with The Times. But it would not disclose the identities of what it called “numerous” hospitals and nursing homes that have reported a total of 158 cases in the state since 2016.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Northwestern Memorial declined to answer any questions from The Times about Ms. Spoor’s case, despite receiving permission from the Spoor family to cooperate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The hospital also declined to respond to questions about how many C. auris cases it has treated, whether there were any current cases, what precautions it was taking and other queries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“After careful consideration, we are going to pass on participating in this story,” Christopher King, a hospital spokesman, wrote in an email in response to questions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Generally, health care institutions have said that they do not want to worry the public unnecessarily, given that they are working hard to control the spread of the infection and also that the germ is not a health threat to the general public. The people at the greatest risk are those who have compromised immune systems, typically through illness and age, and who are in hospitals and nursing homes where many infections are carried and transmitted.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor’s tale reveals the powerlessness of patients and institutions in the face of resistant infections.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Late last year, Ms. Spoor began experiencing shortness of breath and appeared to be having a surge of symptoms from lupus, an autoimmune disorder she had been diagnosed with years earlier but that did not seem to disrupt her daily life. Now, her lungs were having trouble absorbing oxygen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor’s family kept a detailed diary of the events, at her request. She went to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, a highly ranked academic medical center affiliated with Northwestern University. There, in mid-December, she had a biopsy that led to complications: The wound bled and she went into cardiac arrest. She was revived and put on a device called an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine to help her breathe.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That machine was considered a way station to help Ms. Spoor survive until she could receive a lung transplant. She felt hopeful she would be able to see her youngest son, Zack, get married in a ceremony planned for June.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But a month later, a blood test found C. auris. Ms. Spoor’s medical records, which the family shared with The Times, contained a note in mid-January in bold type: “This is a highly transmissible fungus that has a propensity to develop resistance.” The records continued, again in bold type, that it was necessary to “discuss with nurses to maintain diligent contact precautions and limited visitors if possible.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those records indicated that the hospital suspected Ms. Spoor picked up the infection from one of the tubes inserted into her body.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor’s son Nicholas, 40, a Chicago architect, said that the day his mother was diagnosed with C. auris, he noticed the nurses and doctors in full protective aprons and gloves, using bleach to wipe off their feet when they entered and left the room. Everything in the room had a white glaze, he said, from the chemicals used to clean it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was like a laboratory,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the family was hopeful. A doctor told them, Nicholas recalled, “that the strain they had had at Northwestern had been susceptible to the drug cocktail they were currently giving her, and they expected it to clear up.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Indeed, according to the medical records, initial lab tests suggested that the strain of C. auris that had infected Ms. Spoor’s bloodstream was susceptible to the hospital’s drug treatment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The records also included hints of doubt. “Limited literature on C. auris indicates a relatively high mortality and this pathogen may be difficult to eradicate,” a Jan. 19 notation said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over the latter half of January, doctors and nurses furiously tried to treat the fungus, but it kept growing back. The drugs weren’t working. Ms. Spoor appeared fatigued, the family said, but was not showing any other particularly obvious signs of infection.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Barely two months earlier, before her biopsy, Ms. Spoor had been thrilled to accept an early Christmas present from the family: She attended a speech by Michelle Obama at the United Center in downtown Chicago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, in the early days of February, she and her family were being told to put her affairs in order. A doctor told Ms. Spoor that there was nothing more to be done. A transplant wasn’t realistic until she was clear of C. auris, but there seemed to be no effective treatment for the infection.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Feb. 8, their grief was suspended briefly and the atmosphere in her hospital room turned celebratory. The Spoors’ youngest son, Zack, married his fiancée, Carley, in a wedding ceremony at her bedside.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bride and groom wore protective blue hospital gowns over their formal wear, and blue gloves. After the chaplain pronounced them husband and wife, said a blessing and an “Amen,” Ms. Spoor grinned as if she had beat the devil at cards.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A few days later, after consulting with the family, doctors removed Ms. Spoor from the oxygenation machine — her life support, essentially. In the hours before, Ms. Spoor said there was one last person she’d like to speak with: her son Nicholas, with whom she had not yet had a final heart-to-heart conversation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“She just said what you’d expect a mom to say to you in that situation,” Mr. Spoor recounted. He tried to elaborate, but began to cry: “I can’t talk about it. She just said the exact right thing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor died on Feb. 11. Her death certificate describes the cause as respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Rosalind Ramsey-Goldman, a rheumatologist who treated Ms. Spoor, said she felt for the family. “Understandably, her family has had a hard time dealing with their loss,” she said. “And as providers, we too were saddened by the events that transpired, and that we were not able to help her when she had this infection.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Spoor’s husband, Greg, said he bore no grudge against the hospital and, in fact, found its care exceptional. He said he wished that he had known to ask about C. auris and the precautions the hospital was taking.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was something that we didn’t even know was out there, and then it happened and it was one of the major reasons she died,” said her son Nicholas. “If you’re not sharing the data about the patients, that’s an issue.”</p>',\n",

       " 'candida-auris-hospitals-ny': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">New York State health officials are considering rigorous new requirements for hospitals and nursing homes to prevent the spread of a deadly drug-resistant fungus called <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/health/drug-resistant-candida-auris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Candida auris</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The requirements could include mandatory pre-admission screening of patients believed to be at-risk and placing in isolation those patients who are infected, or even those just carrying the fungus on their skin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Howard Zucker, the state health commissioner, and a fungal expert from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met last Friday in Manhattan with nearly 60 hospital officials from across the state to discuss the proposed guidelines. State health officials said they were seeking hospital input before issuing the guidelines, which they acknowledged would likely be a hardship for some institutions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Screening can be costly and time-consuming, but the officials said they are determined to stop the spread of C. auris, a fungus of mysterious origin that has been quietly spreading around the world since it was first identified in 2009. Most of the state’s 331 cases of the disease, which is often resistant to antifungal medication, were in Brooklyn and Queens.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While C. auris is not the first drug-resistant germ to take hold, it is so dangerous and easily spread that it is putting new kinds of pressures on the health care system. One hallmark of C. auris is that it can be very difficult to clean from equipment or clothing, and it may spread through the air. Officials suspect that the spores can be shaken loose from bedding and they have been known to cling to walls and ceiling tiles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“One of our guiding objectives is to stop the geographic spread,” said Brad Hutton, the state’s deputy commissioner of public health. He said the state’s efforts to contain the spread have required significant resources — including sending individual infection specialists to investigate more than 150 cases — and that New York now needs help from individual institutions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re at a point where our response strategy needs to change,” he said. He added that he hoped the guidelines would be finalized by the end of the year, but said the state is still determining whether to apply them statewide or just to New York City and surrounding areas. It has yet to be decided whether the guidelines would be recommendations or regulatory requirements, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Zeynep Sumer King, a vice president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group that represents hospitals in the metropolitan region, described the meeting as “very productive and very collaborative.” But she said hospitals raised concerns about such matters as whether hospitals have lab capacity and expertise to handle on-site testing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For the moment, she said, hospitals are pre-screening many patients who appear to be at risk. But it can take a week to get skin-swab results back from the state laboratory, posing challenges for housing patients in isolation during the interim. Further, she said, regular testing is likely to turn up patients who are carriers but not infected, increasing the number of patients who require isolation, appropriately or not.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The more we screen the more we find colonized cases,” she said, “That takes up space and more beds.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The steps proposed by New York, while “draconian,” are probably right to do, said Matthew Fischer, a professor of fungal epidemiology at Imperial College London, and co-author of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6390/739\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a recent scientific review</a> on the rise of resistant fungi. “We’re dealing with something very unusual here,” he said. “I think it seems wise, seeing as we don’t really know what we’re dealing with, to at least attempt control.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The thoughts were echoed by Dr. Tom Chiller, head of the fungal division of the C.D.C., who said New York is “at the forefront and has not shied away” from tackling an issue for which it has been “ground zero.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Going for it now makes sense,” he said, adding of auris: “We have to see if we can stamp it out or keep it in check.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The germ has also spread in New Jersey and Illinois, particularly the Chicago area. The spread of the germ in some hospitals and nursing homes <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/health/candida-auris-hospitals-drug-resistant.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">has been cloaked in secrecy</a> even as it can lead to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/health/candida-auris-fungus-chicago.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">devastating outcomes</a> for individual patients and their families.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">According to the C.D.C., 90 percent of C. auris infections are resistant to at least one drug and 30 percent resistant to at least two drugs. New York State has seen three cases that are resistant to all known treatments. The C.D.C. reports that nearly half the patients who contract C. auris die within 90 days. Most people infected by the germ are already are very ill or have compromised immune systems.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is patients like these that New York state health officials would like to see “prescreened” when they arrive at a hospital — including people who have recently stayed at a hospital intensive care unit or nursing home in Brooklyn or Queens; and those who are on ventilators, catheters or other invasive equipment that allow the infection to enter the body.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. King, from the hospital association, said that hospitals are already screening patients from nursing homes in the affected areas.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The germ is so virulent that the C.D.C. recommends those infected or even just colonized with the fungus — meaning they carry the disease without being infected — should be isolated in individual rooms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For now, much of the burden for surveillance has fallen to the state. The effort has involved the development of a fast-screening test that can analyze a skin swab in a matter of hours. But all hospitals, for the moment, have to send those tests to a state laboratory in Albany and wait several days before receiving the results, though hospitals say the backlog means tests can take a week.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Officials say they are hoping to eventually deploy the tests so they can be done on-site. An additional challenge is dealing with an unusual aspect of C. auris: It doesn’t seem to go away once it’s on the skin, said Dr. Eleanor Adams, a state public health physician who has led the surveillance efforts of C. auris in New York City.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Adams and her team have made 173 visits to follow-up on suspected and confirmed cases at hospitals and nursing homes, and also to test people who came in contact with infected patients. Initially, she said, the team was testing people infected and colonized every few weeks, but she realized that people who are colonized typically remain that way, sometimes indefinitely.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The question remains if anyone is truly cleared. That is an academic point we don’t know,” she said.</p>',\n",

       " 'cash-spilled-highway-atlanta': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The skies above Atlanta can be fickle. Black clouds that deliver flashes of thunder and lightning in the afternoon can change quickly, clearing by nightfall.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Tuesday before sunset it was a fluttering swirl of cash — and a lot of it — blowing through the air that brought traffic to a halt and people into the street when a side door of an armored Garda truck suddenly opened on a highway.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About $175,000 in bills spilled out and were carried away by the wind over a section of Interstate 285, which encircles Atlanta, the police said. The bills scattered to the shoulder of the six-lane westbound section of the highway. Some floated across the divider into eastbound lanes. Bills blew into the woods or sank into storm drains.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More than a dozen commuters screeched to a halt or veered off to the shoulder of the highway near the Dunwoody Road exits, the police said. They scooped up bills from the pavement and returned to their vehicles with fistfuls, and sometimes armloads, of cash.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of them was Randrell Lewis, 26, an Uber Eats driver who was en route to Alpharetta. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I just saw a cloud full of what looked like leaves,” he said in an interview. “No, it was money. I could not believe my eyes. I am not going to lie. The first thing I did was I pulled over and started picking up some money. Everybody started pulling over and it was crazy.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Within minutes, Mr. Lewis said, he had snatched up about $2,000 in singles, fifties and hundreds. He returned $2,094 on Wednesday, the police said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I just wanted to really make sure I am not going to get in trouble for this,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As investigators from the Dunwoody Police Department scoured videos on social media of the spontaneous cash grab, reports filtered in on Wednesday of people stopping on their morning drives on the half-mile stretch of highway to see if there was anything left to scavenge, Sgt. Robert Parsons, a department spokesman, said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If the temptation is there, and you see money falling from the sky, most people would probably take the money,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The nation’s highways have been accidentally generous before. In 2004, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/05/nyregion/armored-truck-spill-paves-turnpike-with-riches-in-small-change.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">an armored truck carrying $2 million flipped over</a> on the New Jersey Turnpike<!-- --> during the evening rush, spilling tens of thousands of dollars in coins.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last year, the back door of a Brink’s armored truck swung open during the morning rush on Interstate 70 near Indianapolis, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/us/cash-armored-truck-indianapolis-highway.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">losing an estimated $600,000 in cash onto the highway.</a> A few months later, a Brink’s armored truck was driving on Route 3 in East Rutherford, N.J., when one of its doors malfunctioned and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/nyregion/truck-crash-cash-highway.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">money blew out onto the roadway</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some returned the money to the police, while others made off with sacks of cash. In the East Rutherford incident, the police recouped about $6,000.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the authorities did elsewhere when the highways were unexpectedly giving, the police in Dunwoody, a suburb north of Atlanta, were watching on Wednesday to see how the limits of ethical behavior would play out. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Heads up Dunwoody, it’s cloudy with a chance of cash,” the department <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dunwoodypolice/posts/10156108388671603?__xts__[0]=68.ARDSDxSniWYkEnV1lzUKHK05jDIDspex0u_H678HxUHrY7zGBFbRm6YtRIziIWZnnbDjE7kUnBgljhhS8-yjyByCzd6O1V1Uln7J19iArI3FYNaDB9OVVkO1wU039JGLmqCUOPePFCT3GRF1A-ZiE_xOPPq7mSRblyMpN4jbleMBF218kHTgWHtozq8cYrbr5IjF54bjU1CFqt3Z5XqQW66JMlM_MnYGJfgBFrTUV5IikSOdaWieHdwOR2s8WzGuZlGaioXcMceXcX_A8wHQnNvZG-SpN9KRxYcwlSYpZL58w1-H0KbvvHpw6zTFRf-9ohcMYJdjHS7bmtU8_5Mw&amp;__tn__=-R\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">said on Facebook</a>, adding, “While we certainly understand the temptation, it’s still theft and the money should be returned.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an interview, Sergeant Parsons said that officers received a 911 call around 8 p.m. on Tuesday about people “frantically” scooping up the money near the Ashford Dunwoody Road exit along the highway, which is bordered by creek beds, trees and office towers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Multiple callers said there was cash flying all over the road,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the time officers arrived, people who had pulled over to grab the loot were nowhere to be seen, Sergeant Parsons said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“People likely saw the police lights coming over the highway,” he said. “‘Oops, time to go! Police are here! Party’s over!’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Officers spoke to the Garda employees, who had stopped the truck on the shoulder after passing drivers had gestured to them that a door was open.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About $200 was retrieved from the highway and surrounding woods — a small fraction of the estimated $175,000 believed to have gone missing, or into peoples’ pockets, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Detectives were trying to contact drivers by looking for license plate numbers on cellphone videos that had been posted on social media. But Sergeant Parsons said that the authorities had no intention of prosecuting anyone who returns the money. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“No harm, no foul,” he said. “But you need to turn that money in.”</p>',\n",

       " 'census-executive-action': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">WASHINGTON — President Trump is planning to take another step in his ongoing battle to place a question about citizenship on the 2020 census by announcing an executive action in the Rose Garden on Thursday, according to a senior administration official familiar with the decision.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump said on Twitter that he would hold an afternoon news conference on the issues of “census and citizenship” days after his attorney general, William P. Barr, suggested he thought there could be a legal path to placing the citizenship question on the census after the Supreme Court blocked its inclusion last month.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump may not issue an executive order on the citizenship question, according to aides briefed on the plan. Executive orders attempt to impose a sweeping unilateral change, as the president has done over 100 times during his presidency, setting up various legal entanglements.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[Barr says legal </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/william-barr-census-citizenship.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">path to census citizenship question exists</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">, but he gives no details.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One option, aides said, is a presidential memorandum that is essentially meant to put his administration’s view on the issue into writing. Mr. Trump has written over 40 memorandums since the beginning of his presidency to pursue policy changes on issues ranging from rural broadband internet access to the service of transgender people in the military.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Trump administration has argued that including the question on census forms is an important part of its efforts to protect the voting rights of the nation’s minority residents, but the Supreme Court rejected that justification as a contrived pretext.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Government experts have predicted that asking the question would cause many immigrants to refuse to participate in the census, leading to an undercount of about 6.5 million people. That could reduce Democratic representation when congressional districts are allocated in 2021 and affect how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending are distributed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whatever action Mr. Trump takes will be subject to review in the courts. Last week, Justice Department lawyers acknowledged that the administration remained subject to injunctions barring the addition of the citizenship question.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The administration will presumably have to file motions to lift those injunctions based on Mr. Trump’s action.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new action will, in any event, almost certainly also give rise to direct legal challenges, and courts may be wary of accepting a new rationale for adding the question when the Supreme Court has already rejected the previous justification as contrived.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There is little doubt, in any event, that the case will again reach the Supreme Court. That case, against the backdrop of a chaotic litigation strategy and shifting legal arguments, will again test the limits of the court’s deference to executive power.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[What you need to know about the </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/citizenship-question-census.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">citizenship question and the census</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In some cases, presidential memoranda also have encountered immediate legal challenges. Mr. Trump’s presidential <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/military-transgender-ban.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">memorandum released in August 2017</a> required all transgender service members to be discharged the following year. That policy encountered a series of legal challenges until January 2019, when the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/us/politics/transgender-ban-military-supreme-court.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Supreme Court</a> reversed an Obama-era decision that transgender people could serve.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And in 2012, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, or DACA, which sought to create protections for immigrants brought to the United States as children, was announced by President Barack Obama through a presidential memo. The future of that program <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/supreme-court-daca-dreamers.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">remains in a legal quagmire</a>.</p>',\n",

       " 'chase-budinger-beach-volleyball': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the 2012 N.B.A. slam dunk contest, Chase Budinger ran up behind Diddy, intercepted his upward toss, launched his 6-foot-7 frame over the rapper’s head, and smashed the ball into the net in one <!-- -->swoop<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now the seven-year N.B.A. veteran is making a compelling encore.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Not on the hardwood, where he earned more than $18 million playing small forward for Houston, Minnesota, Indiana and Phoenix. And not on the indoor volleyball court where he was the <!-- -->national high school player of the year<!-- --> in 2006.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Instead, Budinger has spent the last two years establishing himself as a serious contender in professional beach volleyball. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Budinger’s decision to leave basketball wasn’t easy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In late 2017, he was receiving offers to play overseas, but he wasn’t getting picked up by an N.B.A. team. Basketball was his first love, but he was getting impatient. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I didn’t want to sit around waiting” he said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Budinger is not the first N.B.A. player to transition to beach volleyball. Most notably Wilt Chamberlain and Keith Erickson are both enshrined in the California Beach Volleyball Association Hall of Fame. Beach volleyball is also popular among retired N.B.A. stars such as Luke Walton, Richard Jefferson and Steve Nash, as well as the current Pistons star Blake Griffin, who are all avid four-man players.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Budinger, though, is the first N.B.A. player to pursue pro beach volleyball full-time on two established tours. And here’s the thing about Budinger: he is really good, maybe good enough to star for the United States at the Olympics <!-- -->in two-man beach volleyball, an especially brutal form of the game. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You can bring out the best athletes in the world and we will absolutely destroy them because the skill base is so important,” said Casey Patterson, a 2016 Olympian and Budinger’s current teammate. “Chase has that history of indoor, and he played a position <!-- --> where those skills were necessary to be an influential player.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Budinger, who was an outside hitter in indoor, has become part of an age-old trend among elite athletes, who occasionally try to transfer their skills from one sport to another. Bob Hayes won two gold medals in track and then went on to win a Super Bowl ring. Eric Heiden won five gold medals in speedskating then competed in the Tour de France. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Despite his status as an indoor volleyball phenom growing up in Encinitas, Calif., with an older brother and sister who also played basketball and volleyball, there was never anything about volleyball on Budinger’s “dream <!-- -->board<!-- -->.” (Instead, it featured Michael Jordan quotes, the N.B.A. logo, and a silver Ferrari.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In college he opted to focus on basketball, playing for Lute Olson at the University of Arizona. After three years, Detroit picked him in the second round of the 2009 N.B.A. draft and traded him to Houston the same day.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2011, during the N.B.A. lockout, Budinger dropped a public hint about his future when he entered a pro beach volleyball tournament with a buddy from home.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was a spur of the moment thing,” he said, and it didn’t exactly make him eager to change sports. “It just showed me how much tougher beach volleyball was, how exhausting,” compared to basketball.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the same time, he knew that N.B.A. careers rarely lasted longer than 10 or 12 years. Even if he retired in his early 30s, he could still have 10 prime years on the pro beach scene. “So that was my game plan: when my basketball career was done, go play beach volleyball,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Budinger’s N.B.A. career stalled at 27. So he was open when the two-time Olympian Sean Rosenthal approached, but it took him a month to decide. “The toughest part,” he said, “was putting basketball behind me.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Budinger still misses the N.B.A. lifestyle — the team bonds, the physical contact. “Some days I wake up and just want to push and hit people,” he <!-- -->said<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On the flip side, he said, “I don’t miss waking up and having my back hurt, my knees hurt, and never getting enough sleep. My body’s feeling great now!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At 210 pounds, he is eight pounds lighter than his N.B.A. weight. He also lost two inches from his waist.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last year, as a rookie, Budinger teamed with Rosenthal and finishes second at an A.V.P. tour stop in San Francisco. This year, Budinger and Patterson have already placed fifth on the F.I.V.B. international tour, in Brazil, in May, and have made two top-three finishes on the A.V.P. circuit. They next play in Switzerland, where they will try to to accrue valuable F.I.V.B. points toward Olympic qualifying. A 2020 Tokyo Olympic berth may be a long shot given the depth of American talent and the two-team-per-country limit, but expect to see Budinger “for sure in 2024 and 2028,” said Tyler Hildebrand, the director of coaching for the USA Volleyball beach national team program.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He’s so far ahead intellectually, with his beach volleyball I.Q. — as far as understanding, not execution — than probably 80 percent of our longtime players,” Hildebrand said. “He moves incredibly fast. He jumps extremely well. He’s an unbelievably good passer — hardly anyone at that height is a good passer.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Budinger has two key assets for passing: a “great platform,” Hildebrand said, referring to the way a player’s arms fit together and form a flat surface when they are fully extended, and “he creates great angles. The volleyball is only going to react off the angle <!-- -->it hits. You could be standing on one foot facing the other way, but if you create an angle and the ball hits toward your target, it’s a good pass.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Budinger is also “a great hand setter,” Hildebrand said. Many players will bump set <!-- -->instead<!-- -->, afraid that the referee will call them for double-hitting the ball. “Chase doesn’t fear that.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But most professional players agree that Budinger’s best talent is blocking, which is particularly difficult because it involves timing, deception and reading the hitter.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“A hitter can hit to the angle, to the line, hit high, close their eyes and swing, shoot it over you, and they have a huge range of speeds, angles, and directions to hit the ball,” Hildebrand said. Unlike indoor volleyball, on the beach there is only one blocker and one defender — and plenty of court.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Effective blocking is not measured in statistics alone. A blocker must also instill fear to make the attacker hesitate. To that end, Budinger often dips into Hildebrand’s collection of 6,000 match videos to study opponents’ tendencies, their arm speeds and when to time his jump.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The U.S. has some of the best blockers in the world in the 2008 Olympic gold medalist Phil Dalhausser, 39, and Jake Gibb, 43, but neither is likely to vie for another Olympics past 2020, which is why Budinger, 31, is vital to the country’s future medal hopes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His daily routine consists of two 90-minute practices separated by a lengthy break to simulate the competition format on tour, where athletes play multiple matches per day. He’s earned about $46,000 to date, a tiny fraction of what he made as an N.B.A. player. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And while he is no longer paid to guard Lakers and Cavaliers, he would relish an All-Star day at the beach. “I would love to see LeBron on the sand — or Kobe,” he said, “to see athletically what level they would be at.”</p>',\n",

       " 'cicadas-fungus-butts': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Beneath the soil, <!-- -->cicada<!-- -->s wait — as long as 17 years — until the right temperature beckons them to the surface. At once, they emerge, like zombies rising from graves. They greet the sun, preparing to molt into adults in coming weeks and then fly off to mate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Such is a cicada’s simple life — unless it’s been infected.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Massospora, a parasitic fungus, has lurked just below the surface, awaiting the cicada’s exit. When a nymph digs through infected soil, fungal spores cling to its body. As the cicada matures, massospora multiplies, digesting the insect’s insides, castrating it and replacing its rear end with a chalky white plug of spores.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The cicada buzzes on, seemingly unaware it’s a mushroom’s moving minion. It flies, attempting to mate with unusual vigor. Some males even mimic females to attract and spread their spores to male partners — the more infected, the better. And as their hijacked bodies copulate, spores sprinkle to the earth and massospora spreads.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This really has all the elements of a sci-fi horror story,” <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.davis.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/directory/matthew-kasson\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Matthew Kasson</a>, a mycologist at West Virginia University, said. “How does an organism function even though two-thirds of their body is no longer theirs?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Perhaps, he thinks, the fungus dopes it with psychoactive drugs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As reported last year in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/375105v1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a paper that had not yet been through peer review </a>and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/massospora-parasite-drugs-its-hosts/566324/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">in the Atlantic</a>, Dr. Kasson and colleagues discovered the infected cicadas’ plugs were laced with an amphetamine called cathinone, found only in the khat plant of the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and psilocybin, the hallucinogen that makes magic mushrooms magic.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the time, his team assumed massospora synthesized these drugs on its own, following the same recipes in khat and magic mushrooms. But a follow-up genomic analysis, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1754504819300352\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">published recently in Fungal Ecology</a>, revealed massospora didn’t have the right ingredients. Its drug lab had evolved independently. It also shows that for prospectors seeking pharmaceutical advances in nature, there are more drugs to be found in unexpected places.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We think of most fungi as having fruiting bodies that rise from the soil like umbrellas. But massospora has none. To transport its spores, it uses the cicada’s living body, which spreads the fungus as it mates, like an STD.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But how does the fungus get the cicada to ignore the damage to its body and carry on mating?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Kasson and his team collected cicadas and measured the mass of their spore plugs, comparing it with known chemicals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He was shocked to find psilocybin and cathinone, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.drugs.com/article/csa-schedule-1.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">both schedule 1 drugs</a>, and even informed the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, which allowed the team to continue.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These drugs, used recreationally as mind-alterers or stimulants, are also appetite suppressants. Psilocybin <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367557/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">eases depression and anxiety in cancer patients</a>, and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-1501-5_8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">cathinone in ADHD medications improves</a> concentration. Dr. Kasson suspected they might act similarly on cicadas.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It turned out that infected annual cicadas, which rise each year, were under the influence of psilocybin, while infected periodical cicadas, which emerge after more than a decade, were drugged with cathinone. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And the cicadas infected when emerging from their dirt naps had significantly higher amounts of narcotics in their plugs than the less-active cicadas they infected as adults while copulating. The drug-fueled focus on mating could maximize the critical spore dispersal of those cicadas infected as nymphs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The team had found the drugs. But they wondered what made them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When they <!-- -->sequenced the genomes of massospora fungi species that infect cicadas<!-- -->, they expected to find the genes used by magic mushrooms or khat to produce the narcotic substances. But those genes were missing. One possible explanation is that the fungus and cicada, maybe including the microbes living in its gut, co-evolved a unique interaction to produce these substances.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But what would the cicada get out of it?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Kasson can only speculate. Maybe drugs make cicadas less desirable to predators. Maybe they make cicadas fearless. “Maybe the cicadas just want to feel numb,” he said.</p>',\n",

But when a small group of scientists first saw it a decade ago, they knew that it was more than entertaining. If it was real, it offered the first genuine support for a claim Darwin had made 148 years ago, but never proven: that animals perceived and enjoyed music as much as we did.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They wagered an expensive bottle of Spanish wine on whether it was legitimate, and shared that wine several years later when they were finally convinced it was real.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, the team has published <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.05.035\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">their findings</a> in the journal Current Biology, showing that Snowball can not only groove to music without explicit training, but he’s got his own dance moves. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This suggests that sensitivity to music or capacity for music or musicality is shared among more animals than only humans and might have a long evolutionary history,” said Henkjan Honing, a professor of music cognition at the University of Amsterdam, who was not involved in the research, but who paid off the earlier bet. He said research on Snowball’s dancing persuaded him that musicality is an inborn, biological ability, like language, rather than a learned one, like reading.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whether musicality is embedded in biology is still hotly debated. “My dream for my career is to be able to answer it with some feeling of certainty,” said Aniruddh Patel, a professor at Tufts University near Boston, who has led the Snowball research. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If musicality is something that our brain has been shaped to do, that does speak to people’s questions about what human nature is,” said Dr. Patel. The research also raises the question of whether humans have evolved brain specializations for processing music, as we have for language.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Patel first saw Snowball on YouTube in 2008 and called Irena Schulz, who ran the shelter where the parrot lived. She had a background in biology and agreed to participate in a study. They tested Snowball’s ability to stick to the beat at 11 tempos. He isn’t perfect — rather like a toddler in a music class — but his movements sped up or slowed with the music.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Importantly from a scientific perspective, there was no human rocking out in the room with him, or feeding him treats to reward him for his dance moves. He did receive social rewards, like the verbal encouragement “good boy!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He shakes one leg a dozen beats or so, then the other. He moves back and forth across his padded perch. He bobs his head for a bit, and then sways it side to side. He pauses between moves as if considering what to do next. Researchers counted a repertoire of 14 movements, none explicitly taught.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Snowball’s dancing ability was first noticed by a previous owner. One day, he and his daughter saw Snowball bobbing to the Backstreet Boys. They showered him with attention. And Snowball definitely knows that people appreciate his dancing, Dr. Patel said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The team took more than a decade to publish these findings, Dr. Patel said, because life intervened — graduations, children, etc. He and the paper’s lead author, R. Joanne Jao Keehn, both completed the work this year during sabbaticals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Animals that can move to a beat are likely to be those that learn by vocal imitation, like parrots and maybe dolphins and whales (no one’s tested those). One sea lion, named Ronan, has been shown to bob to a beat, defying this hypothesis. Dr. Honing said he can’t explain how a nonverbal imitator like a sea lion could do this. Ronan was also given food rewards for his bobbing, suggesting that his musicality was learned rather than innate, Dr. Patel said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Humans’ close relative, the monkey, can be taught to tap to a metronome, but it’s a learned skill and is tough to teach, Dr. Patel said. They’re better at responding to a tone than predicting another downbeat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Popular culture suggests that many animals can perceive and enjoy music as well as we can. Think of dancing bears, the internet sensation of freestyling dogs and the cliché about music taming wild beasts. But the bears and dogs are only responding to cues from their owners, not generating the rhythm themselves, research suggests. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">W. Tecumseh Fitch, a biologist and cognitive scientist at the University of Vienna, who was not involved in the research, but who won the earlier bet, strongly believes that musicality has a biological basis. The obvious pleasure derived from music generates by both humans and animals like Snowball supports that belief, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Really what the bird seems to be doing is playing around,” Dr. Fitch said. “He’s not just doing this stereotyped robotic thing. He’s actually experimenting.”</p>',\n",

       " 'colombia-farc-peace-deal': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">When things go wrong, those in power often promise to make it right. But do they? This is the first in a series in which The Times is going back to the scene of major news events to see if those promises were kept.</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After Colombia’s government signed a peace deal with the country’s main rebel group, ending decades of war and upheaval, both sides said it heralded a new era. But two and a half years after the militants agreed to lay down their arms, many of the promises made are not being honored, and the prospect of a true, lasting peace now seems far from certain.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This is what we found:</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">As many as 3,000 militants have resumed fighting, threatening the very foundation of the accord.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Many of the millions of Colombians who once lived in rebel-held territory still await the promised arrival of roads, schools and electricity. The government’s pledge to help rural areas was a big reason the rebels stood down.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Since the peace deal was signed, at least 500 activists and community leaders have been killed, and more than 210,000 people displaced from their homes amid the continuing violence. That undercuts a core selling point of the deal: that it would bring safety and stability.</p><p class=\"css-15hwz5e evys1bk0\">Colombia’s new president, Iván Duque, a conservative who took office in August, has expressed skepticism of the accords <!-- -->and wants to change a commitment that was fundamental to the rebels agreeing to lay down their weapons. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Colombia’s five-decade civil war took at least 220,000 lives and devastated large swaths of the countryside. In rebel-held areas, government services disappeared and the infrastructure crumbled. Many turned to the drug economy to survive.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">All sides were accused of atrocities — kidnappings, rapes and summary executions — that bred deep-seated animosities across the country and even within families. In a war so deeply personal, finding a way out posed an enormous challenge.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So when the government and the largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/27/world/americas/colombia-farc-peace-agreement.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">reached a peace agreement</a> in September 2016 after years of negotiation, much of the world applauded. Juan Manuel Santos, then Colombia’s president, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/world/americas/nobel-peace-prize-juan-manuel-santos-colombia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">won the Nobel Peace Prize</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But peace deals of this scope are never easy to implement, and Colombians knew a long, daunting path was ahead of them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The deal the two sides reached was ambitious and complex — with 578 separate stipulations — but it can be boiled down to a few core promises. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A primary goal of the FARC insurgency was improving the lives of rural Colombians. The deal calls for “universal” education in rural areas for preschool through secondary school; guaranteed access to drinking water; and heavy subsidies for development programs in former rebel territories.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rebels, in turn, would cease all hostilities, turn in their weapons to the United Nations and return to civilian life. The FARC would be allowed to compete in elections and was guaranteed 10 seats in Congress.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[The head of Colombia’s army has ordered</em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/world/americas/colombian-army-killings.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> increased attacks on criminals and rebel groups</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Much of the war was fought in the countryside.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The peace agreement raised hopes that the rural deprivation that fueled the conflict might finally ease. But two years after the accord was signed, a visit to the town of Juan José made clear that little has changed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The community of 8,000 has not received even the most basic services it was promised. With no running water, residents are still forced to rely on untreated wells. No schools have been built in the surrounding villages, despite government pledges, and many children have never seen the inside of a classroom.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While the police are now in Juan José, neither they nor the military have made it to the nearby villages, and new armed groups have moved in to fill the vacuum left by the FARC. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Emilio Archila, an adviser to the government, said many of the biggest development promises in the agreement — such as delivering water and electricity — would take more than a decade to accomplish, <!-- -->given<!-- --> the damage the countryside suffered from the conflict. “Anyone who thinks we could solve these issues in two years doesn’t understand the magnitude of the problem,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Adam Isacson, an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights group, said the government had failed to act. “The government had a window of opportunity to establish the state in lands the rebels gave up, but it didn’t take that chance,” he said. “Now there are many groups fighting for the same territory.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Money is a major obstacle to meeting all the promises.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the peace deal was signed, the estimate was that it would cost about $45 billion to fulfill all the promises over a period of at least 15 years. At the time, the government enjoyed revenue from a state oil company whose output was going for almost $100 a barrel. Now, prices are a third lower.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Much of the FARC’s funding came through the drug trade. But peace did little to make farmers rethink their business model: Last year, the amount of land used for coca leaf production reached an all-time high.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Part of the problem is that the appeal of the lucrative cocaine business is as strong to the armed groups that have swept into rural areas as it once was to the FARC.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the government also bears much of the blame.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The crop-substitution program agreed to in the peace deal promised cash payments to those who uprooted their coca plants and replaced them with legal crops. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But in Juan José, residents say the payments to farmers ceased for a time after President Duque took charge. They eventually resumed at the end of the year, but the officials who were supposed to introduce the alternative crops never arrived.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So many farmers have gone back to planting coca.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A central pillar of the accords was a promise to seek the truth of what happened during the conflict, with the goal of national reconciliation. The deal established the so-called Special Jurisdiction for Peace — tribunals to hear accounts of crimes and abuses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ten thousand former rebels and 2,000 members of the armed forces pledged to testify under a broad blanket of immunity: Blame could be assigned, but no jail time would be handed out, except for a few select crimes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That part of the peace deal, however, was a tough sell for many Colombians. In October 2016, when they were given a chance to weigh in on the accord, they shocked many by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/world/colombia-peace-deal-defeat.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">voting against it</a> in a referendum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Santos sidestepped voters with <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/30/world/americas/colombia-farc-accord-juan-manuel-santos.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a revised deal</a> that he sent straight to Congress.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, Mr. Duque has requested an overhaul of the tribunals, calling them too lenient. Some worry he hopes to dismantle them entirely.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the no-jail pledge was critical to getting the FARC to sign the deal. Reneging on it might well be seen as a bait and switch.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And that could be a deal breaker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The ability to get a lighter sentence and participate in politics is what convinced the FARC to get into politics to begin with,” said Mr. Isacson, the human rights analyst.</p><p class=\"css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70\">What We Found</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some of the promises made in the peace accords have been kept. More than <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.wola.org/analysis/5-ways-united-states-can-support-colombia-peace-process/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">6,804 FARC fighters did initially disarm</a>,<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong>and more than <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://unmc.unmissions.org/en/un-mission-finalizes-activities-neutralization-farc-ep-armament\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">8,994 weapons were surrendered</a>.<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong>By 2017, the FARC had completely demobilized, except for a small dissident group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About 23 percent of the 578 provisions in the deal have been fully carried out, according to a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://kroc.nd.edu/news-events/news/second-kroc-institute-report-shows-steady-progress-of-peace-accord-implementation-in-colombia/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">recent study</a> by the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame, which is monitoring the accords.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the study projected that despite the “steady progress,” only one-third of the commitments made in the deal would be met in the agreed-upon time frame. The rest, it said, were either in a “state of minimal implementation” or had not yet even been touched.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s undeniable that the government hasn’t made good on its promises, whether it’s reintegrating former fighters, agrarian development or political reforms,” said Julián Gallo Cubillos, a former FARC commander who is now a Colombian senator. “There’s been a general neglect.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the biggest failures has come on the security front, which government officials and rebels alike assured skeptical Colombians would be the largest dividend of the peace deal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In many areas where the FARC has disarmed, the government has yet to arrive in force, breaking a key promise of the accords.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The resulting lawlessness and disorder in rural areas <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/13/world/americas/colombia-farc-government-war.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">have proved deadly for Colombian activists</a>, 252 of whom were killed last year, up from 191 in 2017, according to Colombia’s Institute of Studies for Peace and Development.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The FARC said this month that 130 of its former fighters had been killed since the signing of the peace deal. The ex-rebels have repeatedly complained that demobilizing has left them defenseless against the paramilitary gangs still roaming the countryside.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This has led to a major setback for peace: Experts estimate that as many as 3,000 militants <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/world/americas/colombia-farc-peace.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">have taken up arms again</a> — a figure equal to more than 40 percent of those who initially demobilized. It includes new recruits.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Things have also not gone well on the political front. FARC leaders did form a party to participate in elections, but they soon learned that military victories can be easier than political ones. Unpopular for their history of kidnappings and killings, they were <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/world/americas/colombia-farc-campaign.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">attacked</a> with stones on the campaign trail, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/world/americas/colombia-election-timochenko-farc.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">dropped out</a> of a presidential bid and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/world/americas/colombia-election.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">did not win</a> a single elected seat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The optimism that peace was around the corner thanks to the deal Mr. Santos signed has faded among people like Andrés Chica, a farmer who lives near Juan José but now fears heading into town.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What he sold us was a dream,” said Mr. Chica.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">The Takeaway:</strong> <!-- -->Peace deals are hard.

       " 'colombian-army-killings': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">BOGOTÁ, Colombia — The head of Colombia’s army, frustrated by the nation’s faltering efforts to secure peace, has ordered his troops to double the number of criminals and militants they kill, capture or force to surrender in battle — and possibly accept higher civilian casualties in the process, according to written orders and interviews with senior officers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the start of the year, Colombian generals and colonels were assembled and told to sign a written pledge to step up attacks. Daily internal presentations now show the number of days that brigades have gone without combat, and commanders are berated when they don’t carry out assaults frequently enough, the officers said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One order causing particular worry instructs soldiers not to “demand perfection” in carrying out deadly attacks, even if significant questions remain about the targets they are striking. Some officers say that order has instructed them to lower their standards for protecting innocent civilians from getting killed, and that it has already led to suspicious or unnecessary deaths.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The military tried a similar strategy to defeat Colombia’s rebel and paramilitary groups in the mid-2000s, before a landmark peace deal was signed to end decades of conflict.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the tactics caused a national outrage when it emerged that soldiers, aiming to meet their quotas, engaged in widespread <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/world/americas/29iht-colombia.4.17352270.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">killings and disappearances of civilians</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, another incarnation of the policy is being pushed by the new government against the country’s remaining criminal, guerrilla and paramilitary groups, according to orders reviewed by The New York Times and three senior officers who spoke about them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/americas/colombia-farc-peace-deal.html?module=inline\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/americas/colombia-farc-peace-deal.html\" title=\"\">[Read more about why the peace deal is fraying.]</a></a></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new orders have sent a chill down the ranks of the army. Colombia’s military remains under investigation for the series of illegal killings in the mid-2000s, known as “false positives.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Soldiers repeatedly killed peasants and claimed they were guerrilla fighters, sometimes even dressing them in fatigues and planting weapons near their bodies. The tactics stemmed from superiors demanding increased body counts, prosecutors say.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two of the officers said in lengthy interviews that Colombian soldiers were under intense pressure yet again — and that a pattern of suspicious killings and cover-ups had begun to emerge this year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a meeting recounted by one of the officers, a general ordered commanders to “do anything” to boost their results, even if it meant “allying ourselves” with armed criminal groups to get information on targets, a divide-and-conquer strategy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Beyond that, officers said, soldiers who increase their combat kills are being offered incentives, like extra vacation, in a pattern they fear is strikingly similar to the unlawful killings of the mid-2000s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have gone back to what we were doing before,” said one of the officers, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals by their superiors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Major Gen. Nicacio Martínez Espinel, the top commander of Colombia’s army, acknowledged issuing the new orders and having officers set concrete goals for killing, capturing or forcing criminal groups and militants to surrender.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said he had issued the written order that instructed top commanders to “double the results” because of the threat that Colombia continues to face from guerrilla, paramilitary and criminal organizations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The criminal threat rose,” he said. “If we continued at the pace that we were going at, we would not have completed our objectives.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, the general disputed how officers have interpreted his instructions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The orders are that you are operationally effective,” he said. “Some told me they wanted a 10 percent increase, good, you do 10 percent. Some told me they wanted a 50 percent increase, but with no dead. Some said, ‘I want a 100 percent increase.’ There are some who have kept their word, and others that haven’t been able to.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He also acknowledged that the orders tell commanders to conduct operations when they are still uncertain about their targets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">However, General Martínez argued that the instructions referred only to planning missions, not to carrying them out.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Respect for human rights is the most important thing,” he said. “Everything has taken place within the letter of the law.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the order itself says, “You must launch operations with 60 to 70 percent credibility or exactitude” — leaving enough room for error that the policy has already led to questionable killings, two of the officers said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new orders signal an increase in military campaigns against guerrilla and paramilitary groups in Colombia, which reached a peace deal with the nation’s largest rebel group — the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC — just two years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Peace has been elusive. Many former guerrillas have returned to fighting, while other criminal and paramilitary groups have expanded their control over parts of the country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One rebel group that never signed a peace deal carried out a deadly car bombing in the capital in January.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Colombia is also under pressure from the Trump administration to show progress in cracking down on drug trafficking, a battle that has shown little progress despite $10 billion in American aid.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the pressure mounted, President Iván Duque, a conservative who campaigned against the peace deal because he thought it was too soft on the rebels, replaced the country’s top army commanders in December.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Duque’s government appointed nine officers linked to killings in the mid-2000s, including some who now hold top positions directing military offensives throughout Colombia, according to documents published by Human Rights Watch. One of the commanders linked to the killings, according to the rights group, is General Martínez<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">, </strong>who at the time held a mid-ranking position.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">General Martínez says he did not participate in any of the unlawful killings and that he is not under investigation by Colombia’s attorney general’s office.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The unlawful killings are a particularly contentious chapter in Colombia’s recent history. From 2002 to 2008, as many as 5,000 civilians or guerrillas were killed outside of combat, according to the United Nations. At least 1,176 members of the security forces have been convicted of crimes related to the illegal deaths, according to the government.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two of the officers who spoke to The Times said they had served during the killings and risen in rank through subsequent periods of reckoning and reform.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But a major shift took place, they say, when General Martínez called a meeting of his top officers in January, a month after assuming command of the army.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The meeting included the country’s top 50 generals and colonels, who met in a hangar in the mountains outside of Bogotá. Many were eager to hear whether there would be a new direction under the new leadership.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After a break, the commanders returned to tables where they found a form waiting for each one of them, the officers said. The form had the title “Goal Setting 2019” at the top and a place for each commander to sign at the bottom.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The form asked commanders to list the “arithmetic sum of surrenders, captures and deaths” of various armed groups for the previous year in one column, and then provide a goal for the following year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some of the commanders seemed confused — until they were instructed to double their numbers this year, the officers said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Soon afterward, the same order appeared from General Martínez, this time in writing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The goal is to double the operational results at all levels of command,” read the orders, which included his signature.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Three days after the meeting near Bogotá, a group of military intelligence officers and regional commanders were convened in the city of Cúcuta, on the border with Venezuela, the officers said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the meeting, the officers said, they were told, “We have to do anything now,” including using illegal paramilitary groups to provide information on rival armed groups “in order to get results.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The suggestion of working with one armed group to defeat another created a hush among the people there, said one of the officers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Feb. 19, a new document titled “50 Command Orders” emerged. One order demanded “opportune and massive strikes” against the enemy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the instructions on the threshold required for ordering deadly attacks were the largest shift from previous policy, the officers said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the past, they argued, military operations needed to be carried out with at least 85 percent of certainty of the target, after a series of meetings between commanders and intelligence agents to approve a strike. The new order called for a lower standard.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Soon after, the officers said they began identifying suspicious killings or arrests.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the officers cited the killing of what an army report called the death on Feb. 23 of a member of the paramilitary group Clan del Golfo. The report said that three members of the group had fought an army platoon, and that the fight ended in one death and two arrests. A pistol and revolver were found with the men.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The report was provided to The Times by the officer. He found it unlikely that three lightly armed criminals would combat an entire platoon of 41 men.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Perhaps the most disputed killing since General Martínez took command occurred around April 22, when the body of Dimar Torres, a former guerrilla who had disarmed under the peace deal, was found outside a village near the Venezuelan border.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Cellphone video circulated by villagers showed Mr. Torres’s body shot through the head. Villagers could be heard screaming epithets against paramilitary groups.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It turned out Mr. Torres was killed by the army. Colombia’s defense minister, Guillermo Botero, at first defended the shooting by saying Mr. Torres had been killed during a struggle over a weapon with a soldier. But days later, the general in charge of the region offered a public apology.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">José del Carmen Abril, a peasant leader in the village, said townspeople had found soldiers near Mr. Torres’s body trying to “dig a grave to make him disappear” that night. Cellphone video showed soldiers near a half-dug grave.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The officers said they had also been told that the soldiers were trying to hide Mr. Torres’s body. While the case has become a national controversy, the officers said that other killings were likely to go unnoticed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They produced a copy of a slide from a February presentation with the title “Days Without Combat.” It listed brigades and task forces, tallying how long each had gone without doing battle. The instructions were clear, they said: Increase kills, captures and surrenders.</p>',\n",

The pamphlets also detailed how <!-- -->feeding pigs a daily regimen of two antibiotics<!-- --> would make them fatter and, as any farmer understands, a heavier pig is a more profitable pig. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rise of drug-resistant germs, caused by overuse of antibiotics, is one of the world’s most nettlesome health predicaments. Excessive use of the medicines has allowed germs to develop defenses against them, rendering a growing number of drugs ineffective for people and animals. The practices of livestock farmers, who for decades have used huge quantities of the drugs deemed important to humans, have long been viewed as one of the roots of the problem, but the role of the companies that make the drugs has received less scrutiny.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Antibiotics continue to be an important part of the business of companies like Elanco, which spun off from Eli Lilly in September, its share price soaring to $33 from $24. While Elanco is developing antibiotic alternatives for animals, like vaccines and enzymes, the antibiotics promoted by the Pig Zero campaign are exactly the kinds that global public health officials are trying to curb. And Elanco is no outlier — its rivals are also urging aggressive use of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190604015203/https://www.zoetisus.com/products/beef/bovatec.aspx?_ga=2.127535694.216929652.1537192460-1078237251.1536078211\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">their own antibiotic cocktails</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The reality is that antibiotics and large-scale industrial farming really grew up together,” said Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state epidemiologist and state public health veterinarian in Kansas, who sits on advisory boards addressing antibiotic resistance. She equated the problem with climate change. “By the time people understand and believe it,” Dr. Hansen said, “it may be too late.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Elanco had already been put on notice about the drugs used in <!-- -->its Pig Zero <!-- -->push. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration <!-- -->warned<!-- --> Novartis Animal Health, which had been acquired by Elanco, that the same antibiotic cocktail was “unsafe” and “misbranded,” because it was being illegally marketed to fatten pigs, rather than to simply treat disease. One of the drugs, tiamulin, has been a top seller for Elanco; <!-- -->the W.H.O. views it as medically important to humans, but American regulators do not<!-- -->. Pig Zero trumpets the benefits of coupling tiamulin with chlortetracycline, a drug made by Elanco’s competitors that both American and international regulators consider <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/cia2017.pdf?ua=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">medically important</a> to humans. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an interview at Elanco’s headquarters outside Indianapolis, Jeffrey Simmons, the chief executive, said the company had decided to change the program’s marketing and to stop distributing the Pig Zero brochure after The New York Times began asking questions about it. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re trying to be stewards and leaders at the same time,” said Mr. Simmons, adding that the brochure “wasn’t misrepresentation, necessarily, relative to the label or the science, or how a farmer would look at it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. <!-- -->Shabbir Simjee<!-- -->, Elanco’s chief medical officer, said drugs like those in the campaign “would never be administered” in a herd “without some animals being physically sick,” adding that “there would need to be some animals showing clinical signs.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He likened treating a herd to caring for children in a nursery: “If one child gets sniffles, you usually find that the whole class ends up with a cold, and this is exactly the same principle.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But children almost certainly would not all be treated with preventive antibiotics in such a situation, and many scientists believe animals often should not be treated that way, either.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The connection of overuse of antibiotics in livestock to human health takes two paths: As bacteria develop defenses against drugs widely used in animals, those defense mechanisms can spread to other bacteria that infect humans; and, resistant germs are transmitted from livestock to humans — through undercooked meat, farm-animal feces seeping into waterways, waste lagoons that overflow after natural disasters like <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/climate/florence-hog-farms.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Hurricane Florence</a>, or when farm workers and others come into <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://oem.bmj.com/content/72/2/90\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">contact with animals</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">[Read other articles in our series <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/deadly-germs-lost-cures?module=inline\" title=\"\">Deadly Germs, Lost Cures</a>.]</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">New F.D.A. regulations put in effect in the waning days of the Obama administration prohibited farms from fattening livestock by lacing their feed with medically important antibiotics. The new rules, along with rising consumer demand for antibiotic-free meat, cut antibiotic use significantly in 2017. But such drugs <!-- -->are still routinely given to<!-- --> pigs <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/cattle-antiobiotics.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">and cattle</a>, accounting for almost 80 percent of medically important livestock antibiotics in the United States and nearly 5,000 tons of active ingredient. Worldwide use is projected to keep rising sharply as growing middle classes in places like China and Brazil demand more meat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ellen Silbergeld<!-- -->, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, who has worked with the W.H.O. on drug resistance, called the continuing promotion of the drugs by pharmaceutical companies “very dangerous.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The reason they’re doing it, though, is money, honey,” she added. “That’s what it’s all about. That’s what it’s always been about.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, the industry has an important ally in Washington: President Trump, who appointed one of Elanco’s former executives, Ted McKinney, as under secretary of agriculture for trade and foreign agricultural affairs. Mr. McKinney told international food safety regulators at a meeting last summer in Rome that they were too singularly focused on consumers, at the expense of pharmaceutical companies and research scientists working to meet growing global demand for food. “We have got to rededicate a focus on them as our customers,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2015, Mr. Simmons, Elanco’s chief executive, joined a White House summit meeting to pledge the company’s commitment to curbing antibiotic use.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sylvia M. Burwell<!-- -->, then the health and human services secretary, hailed the gathering as a “hopefully historic step to protect the health of our nation.” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the time, warned that antibiotic resistance “could result in the medicine chest being empty when we need it most.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Simmons outlined Elanco’s lofty aims. “We’re going to create antibiotic alternatives,” he said, adding, “We believe strongly that there are solutions, there are pipelines, there are options.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A farm boy from upstate New York, he was a nearly 30-year veteran of Eli Lilly when Elanco spun off last year with its 5,800 employees. His wife helps run a church food bank. Mr. Simmons sits in an unassuming cubicle on Elanco’s campus.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He refers to himself as a “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-simmons-4b352a1a/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">purpose-driven leader</a>” on a mission to fight hunger — echoing the megachurch founder Rick Warren’s best-selling book “The Purpose-Driven Life,” which Mr. Simmons has read and taken to heart. He uses social media to spread a sort of protein-affordability gospel: “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Protein?src=hash\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">#Protein</a> is a nutritious part of a balanced diet, but many don’t have access to it,” he <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JeffSimmons2050/status/679306402083418112\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">once wrote on Twitter</a>. “We can/must change this!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While microbiologists emphasize the urgency of fighting antibiotic resistance, agrochemical industry veterans like Mr. Simmons say it must be balanced against hunger and the world’s growing demand for food. He often recounts his time as an executive in Brazil, when an anguished guard in his gated community sought help <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1299&amp;context=rangebeefcowsymp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">feeding his two children</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m not doing it for a paycheck or profits,” Mr. Simmons said in an interview. “Purpose has to override that.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">(He does get a paycheck, though. His <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1739104/000104746919000609/a2237775zs-4a.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">total compensation</a> was $5.4 million last year.) </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Financial disclosures for Elanco and its rival Zoetis, which spun off from Pfizer <!-- -->in 2013<!-- -->, show the two companies sell roughly $2 billion annually in livestock antibiotics. In Elanco’s case, antibiotic sales represent more than one-third of its overall business. Some antibiotics, like monensin, a top seller for Elanco, belong to a class not used in people, and thus are not considered a resistance threat. But so-called shared-class antibiotics, like chlortetracycline, are used in humans and animals, creating risk for resistant infections.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Simmons said that while Elanco “started as an antibiotic company,” antibiotics that are medically important for people and used in livestock feed now make up only 5 percent of its sales. “We’re not building our company on that 5 percent,” he said. But the company has also said that 12 percent of Elanco’s sales overall, including antibiotics used in feed and administered in other ways, come from medically important antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While consumer demand has made developing alternatives an industry imperative, few companies are eager to cede ground on existing business.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Del Holzer, who was the director of meat and poultry for Elanco’s global industry food team from 2012 to 2017, said the company and its competitors want to take positive steps and look good, to a point. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They want to do the right thing,” said Mr. Holzer, who now works for a division of the agriculture giant Cargill, an Elanco competitor that develops antibiotic alternatives. “But they say, ‘My bottom line is my shareholders will be really pissed at me.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When antibiotics were first discovered more than a century ago, no one intended them for animals. But then an American company, Lederle Laboratories, announced in 1950 that chickens grew faster when they were fed chlortetracycline, one of the drugs included in the Pig Zero campaign.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the early 1960s, almost half of livestock antibiotics were aimed at making animals fatter. Drugs were marketed by the barrel; a 50-pound chlortetracycline bag <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6140039-1972-Pfizer-and-Cyanamid.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">advertised</a> in 1972 in <!-- -->The Herald<!-- -->, in Jasper, Ind., cost $9.25.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A Purina Pig Chow ad that appeared in an Iowa newspaper in the early 1960s promised that it was “power packed with the potent vitamins, minerals and anti-biotics pigs need for fast growth and good health.” Another ad, in a Missouri paper, promoted “full-o-pep Pig Grower,” a feed laced with antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet scientists already had misgivings. In 1969, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldselect/ldsctech/081vii/st0706.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Swann Committee report</a>, commissioned by the British Parliament, concluded the problem of antibiotic resistance was significant. In 1976, a landmark study published in Nature found that resistant E. coli strains could be passed from chickens fed with antibiotics to other chickens, and then to farm workers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was pretty obvious to me that the prudent thing to do would be to take low levels of antibiotics out of animal feed,” said Dr. Hansen, the former state epidemiologist in Kansas. As an F.D.A. employee in 1978, she gathered evidence for Congress linking antibiotic use in livestock to resistant infections in humans, but no action was taken.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The science was there, the evidence was pretty easy,” she said. “It was a slam dunk.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The pharmaceutical industry has pushed back. In 1997, researchers from Elanco were among those who authored a lengthy <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1365-2672.1997.00280.x\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">review</a> in the Journal of Applied Microbiology dismissing concerns about antibiotic use in animals, writing, “We are confronted by a lack of information, a wall of ignorance.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pharma companies kept a stranglehold on basic information. V<!-- -->arious <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2013/02/06/recordhigh-antibiotic-sales-for-meat-and-poultry-production\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">estimates</a> by academics and public policy groups claim<!-- --> as much as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://livablefutureblog.com/2010/12/new-fda-numbers-reveal-food-animals-consume-lion%E2%80%99s-share-of-antibiotics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">80 percent</a> of American antibiotic sales go to livestock.

By the time we understand the full magnitude of this threat, it may be too late.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There has been progress. In 2017, when the F.D.A. effectively banned the use of medically important antibiotics to fatten livestock, their consumption <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForIndustry/UserFees/AnimalDrugUserFeeActADUFA/UCM628538.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">fell by a third</a> <!-- -->that year<!-- -->.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But health experts say the regulations did not go far enough and see a sleight of hand at work, with industry marketing now presenting routine antibiotic use as a “proactive” necessity and weight gain an ancillary benefit, as Elanco did in the Pig Zero marketing campaign.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before her death last year, Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a New York Democrat who was the only microbiologist serving in Congress, lamented the F.D.A.’s new rules as being riddled with loopholes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s useless,” she said of the regulations. “That’s why the industry’s supporting it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A recent tour of Elanco’s labs at its Indiana headquarters swept past a virology lab and a large machine analyzing the DNA of thousands of hamster cells. Amid beakers and hardware, scientists in coats and protective glasses discussed their efforts to find alternatives to antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Aaron Schacht, Elanco’s <!-- -->head of research and development<!-- -->, said those alternatives could include enhancing the animals’ own immune function, immunizing <!-- -->them<!-- --> against particular pathogens or reshaping their gut bacteria to favor the good ones.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Could we eliminate the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics? I think it’s possible,” he said. “Now let’s let the science play out.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But change comes in fits and starts. Mr. Holzer, the former Elanco official, said the drugmaker had created “country-specific websites” where “there were certain things you couldn’t talk about in the U.S., but then talk about in Poland.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a bit of a hypocritical thing,” he added. “Elanco wants to lead the charge on antibiotic use but then sells into these countries that could become the biggest part of the problem. The idea is that as long as we don’t lose antibiotics in country XYZ, we can take our hit in the U.S., and get the P.R. for it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Elanco called Mr. Holzer’s comments “completely inaccurate.” Colleen Dekker, a spokeswoman, said the company no longer included “growth promotion” — fattening up animals — as an approved use for medically important antibiotics worldwide, “regardless of what local regulations allow.” The company was also intentionally decreasing its sales of such drugs, she said, <!-- -->show<!-- -->ing that “this is far more than a ‘P.R. effort.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But for Pig Zero, the company sees a problem only in the marketing. Going forward, Ms. Dekker said, such drugs would be sold “more from a health perspective” than from “a weight-gain perspective.” Mr. Simmons said of The Times’s inquiries, “We had a lot of dialogue about Pig Zero that probably we wouldn’t have had,” adding, “That’s good.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p>',\n",

But the decision to kill the proposal is the second time this week that Mr. Trump’s drug-pricing initiatives have failed. On Monday, a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/health/drug-prices-tv-ads-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">federal judge threw out a rule</a> that would have required pharmaceutical companies to list the price of their drugs in television advertisements.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a statement Thursday, Judd Deere, a spokesman for the White House, said, “Based on careful analysis and thorough consideration, the president has decided to withdraw the rebate rule.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rebate rule had long met resistance from within the White House, where fiscal conservatives had balked at the potential cost. The rule was expected to raise drug-plan premiums for all Medicare beneficiaries, and in May, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2019-05/55151-SupplementalMaterial.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">concluded </a>that the rule, if adopted, would cost taxpayers $177 billion within 10 years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The administration and leading members of Congress have been discussing some other legislative proposals, including negotiating directly with companies to set caps on some drug prices. The president also announced last week that he would issue an executive order that might somehow connect prices in the United States to those charged by companies in overseas markets, but the details remained unclear.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“President Trump will consider using any and all tools to ensure that prescription drug costs will continue to decline,” Mr. Deere added.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The news, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-drug-prices-plan-pharma-ec527a14-0287-492b-937d-a7144c47b734.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">reported earlier</a> by the news outlet Axios, also dealt a blow to the drug industry. It had strongly backed the measure and tried to blame pharmacy benefit managers for rising prices.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rule would have essentially done away with after-the-fact rebates that drug companies pay to the private companies that operate Medicare’s Part D drug plans, and instead required that any discounts be passed to consumers at the pharmacy counter. Medicare beneficiaries with high drug costs often have to pay a drug’s list price, or a percentage of it, during certain phases of their coverage. They were required to do so even though, in many cases, the companies operating the plans were collecting rebates on the same drug.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rule had been opposed by the insurers and pharmacy benefit managers who operate Medicare’s drug plans because they said they used the rebates to pressure drug companies to keep their prices low, and used the savings to keep premiums low for all Medicare beneficiaries. But the drug industry has been campaigning for years on the idea that it is unfair for insurers to keep the rebates when consumers are paying the list price through high deductibles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, had been a strong proponent of the proposed rule, which he said addressed one of the key reasons the market for drugs is broken.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a statement, Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Azar, said he and Mr. Trump were working together on a range of other drug-pricing proposals. “Secretary Azar is fighting alongside President Trump to lower prescription drug costs and protect America’s seniors,” she said.</p>',\n",

       " 'electric-vehicle-home-chargers': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Formula E racers used to swap out cars when their batteries were drained, but that’s hardly an answer for your daily commute.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And while additional high-tech roadside charging facilities will make <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/business/energy-environment/electric-cars-charging.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">electric driving more practical</a>, it’s the availability of convenient home charging equipment that persuades many vehicle buyers to go electric.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Home is the main charging location for most E.V. owners,” said Gil Tal, director of the Plug-In Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis. “Even in California, more than half of the E.V. owners are not using any out-of-home charging infrastructure. They are O.K. with just plugging in at home.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over 80 percent of electric vehicle owners charge at home, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/electricvehicles/charging-home\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> Energy Department says</a>, adding that “charging in a single-family home allows you to take advantage of low, stable residential electricity rates.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Three methods of charging cars’ lithium-ion batteries are in use: Level 1, using a standard 110-volt outlet; Level 2, an upgrade to a 240-volt outlet; and DC fast-charging, which uses direct-current electricity. However, owing to the high cost and complexity of DC equipment, home use is typically kept to Levels 1 and 2.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Level 1 charging, with the plug-in cord that is standard on electric vehicles, can replenish the battery of some limited-range electrics and hybrids — like the Chevrolet Volt or Fiat 500e — overnight.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For cars with larger batteries, Level 1 is painfully slow. That category includes models with a range of over 200 miles, like the Chevrolet Bolt, the Nissan Leaf Plus, the Kia e-Niro, the Hyundai Kona Electric, the various Teslas, and most coming models. Charging a depleted battery for these would require days.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Level 2 devices, at 32 amps, can add about 25 miles of range per hour. Thus, a depleted 60-kilowatt-hour Bolt battery can typically be fully charged in 10 hours. A drained Tesla 100-kilowatt-hour battery will take about 14 hours.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Level 2 charging requires aftermarket equipment that operates on 240-volt AC household current, like some air-conditioners or other large appliances. A 32- to 40-amp charger sells for about $600, with feature-laden smart chargers topping $1,000. Portable chargers that provide about 16 amps of current are offered for less than $300, but as amperage and price go down, charging time goes up.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Level 2 chargers meant for outdoor installation are hard-wired to a 240-volt source. That will add $500 or more to the cost. Chargers for indoor use can be plugged into a 240-volt outlet. This might be the best choice for an owner with a 240-volt outlet in the garage, but installing one will cost about as much as hard-wiring a charger to the breaker box.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most electric vehicle owners don’t drive over 200 miles on a normal day, so the battery isn’t fully drained by evening. In that case, refilling it on a Level 2 charger can take just a few hours. If the daily commute is only 20 miles and that mileage is rarely exceeded, the Level 1 plug-in might suffice, as would a portable 16-amp Level 2 charger. It gets easier if the office provides some charging stations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Level 2 chargers for home installation are compact, and most have an 18- or 25-foot charging cord, so the vehicle doesn’t have to be parked next to the unit. More expensive Level 2 smart chargers can be switched on or off with a cellphone and programmed to charge when electricity rates are lowest, though many electric vehicles now come with firmware and apps that offer similar abilities with a basic charger.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Asked what improvements in home charging we might see in the years to come, Mr. Tal said Level 2 technology was reasonably mature. However, he does anticipate a market for chargers powered by solar panels that generate DC current, no complex inverters needed.</p>',\n",

Nadal joined him soon after, defusing the big serve of the American Sam Querrey to win, 7-5, 6-2, 6-2, on No. 1 Court.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Friday’s match will be the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.atptour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/roger-federer-vs-rafael-nadal/F324/N409\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">40th meeting</a> for Federer and Nadal, and it will be their first at Wimbledon since the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/07/sports/tennis/07tennis.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">2008 final</a>, which <!-- -->is on nearly every short list of tennis’s greatest matches and has inspired books and a documentary.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nadal finished off that five-set classic in near darkness. Flash bulbs were required to chronicle the trophy ceremony on Centre Court. The match was widely viewed as a passing of the torch, the long-dominant Federer, then 26, ceding his spot to the irresistible youth of a 22-year-old Nadal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That was how it had previously worked in men’s tennis: Topple the king and assume the throne. But 11 years later, it is clear that was not the right read of the situation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Reality has turned out to be much richer, much more layered.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Federer, 37, and Nadal, 33, have <!-- --> continued to push each other, contending for longer than even they could have imagined when they last traded topspin forehands and compliments at the All England Club.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Both have amassed plenty more titles and plenty more millions. Both have had dips and revivals. Both had to adjust, with varying degrees of grace, to the emergence of Novak Djokovic, the defending Wimbledon champion and No. 1 seed, who has a winning record against each of them. He is back on the prowl this year and looking just as menacing as he prepares to play Roberto Bautista Agut in Friday’s other semifinal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Federer and Nadal, once the seminal figures in men’s tennis, have had to adapt to being part of a Big Four with Andy Murray in the mix, then part of a Big Five with Stan Wawrinka in the mix.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now they are back to the Big Three — all over 30; all jostling to be viewed someday as the greatest of all time; all head and shoulders above their younger rivals, which is deeply gratifying and a little unsettling.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think it’s definitely not a — how do you say? — regular time in tennis in the men’s game,” Federer said, uncharacteristically searching for words on Wednesday. “I don’t think we would have thought that Novak, me and Rafa — all of us — were going to be so solid, so dominant for so many years.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Who could have guessed that they would still be healthy enough, motivated enough and good enough to remain on top of the global tennis ladder?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It speaks to the greatness of these guys and also speaks to the fact that the younger generation still has a lot to do,” said Tommy Haas, the former <!-- -->star from Germany who faced all three for years and is now the tournament director of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif. “Maybe the younger guys need to be even more determined or maybe take some notes on what these guys are doing differently or come up with some new ideas.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this latest Federer-Nadal match is how unremarkable it seems that they are back in the Wimbledon semifinals at this stage of their careers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Not only are these two guys still at it, but they are still very much at the peak of their powers,” said Jon Wertheim, the author of “Strokes of Genius,” a book about the 2008 Wimbledon final. “Their rivalry still has so much heft, and their passion for the sport hasn’t diminished. They both approach the sport so differently and get to the top of the mountain by such different paths, but here we are.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yes, here we still are. And though Nadal has often struggled by his standards at Wimbledon in recent years, he arrived fresh and eager after skipping the early grass-court season following his 12th French Open victory.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rematch with Federer has looked likely since Nadal <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/sports/tennis/rafael-nadal-nick-kyrgios-wimbledon.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">solved a problem called Nick Kyrgios </a>in the second round. Both have appeared to gather strength and momentum through the rounds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They both know each other so well and are both playing well, so it will most likely be a good one,” said Ivan Ljubicic, one of Federer’s coaches.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That sounds promising, because the balance of power was lopsided when they played in the semifinals of the French Open last month. On one of the windiest days in the tournament’s history, with clouds of red clay swirling into their eyes, Nadal was by far the better player, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/sports/rafael-nadal-roger-federer-french-open.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">winning, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Federer, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/sports/federer-nadal-french-open-history.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">vulnerable to Nadal in any conditions at Roland Garros</a>, confessed to feeling powerless.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Friday’s rematch will be played on what Federer considers his turf.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wednesday’s victory over Nishikori was his 100th singles win at Wimbledon, extending his men’s record.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s not like you’re going, ‘I have to get my 100th, I have to get my 100th,’ every point,” Federer said. “I’m just trying to win the next point and the next game and eventually the match. When you throw your hands up in the air, you are not thinking, ‘100, 100, 100.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What matters most, of course, is that he has won a record eight singles titles at the All England Club, the most recent coming during his resurgent 2017 season.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nadal’s two titles came in 2008 and 2010. He reached the final in 2011 but did not get past the fourth round at Wimbledon again until last year, when Djokovic beat him in an edgy and extraordinary two-day, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/sports/rafael-nadal-novak-djokovic-wimbledon.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">five-set semifinal</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nadal is not one to confess to holding a grudge, but he is looking hungry on grass this year. He is returning and defending exceptionally well, but also serving effectively, attacking on his groundstrokes and pushing forward in an attempt to shorten the points.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s going to be tough,” Federer said. “Rafa really can hurt anybody on any surface. I mean, he’s that good. He’s not just a clay-court specialist, we know.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He has proved it many times over, winning three United States Open titles and one Australian Open title, all on hardcourts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He has 18 Grand Slam singles titles, just two behind the men’s record, held by Federer. If he eliminates Federer from contention on Friday, the chance will be there to narrow the gap to one.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is hard to believe that Nadal is not thinking about that, but he has been at pains to emphasize that he thinks about it only when asked about it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Any of the three of us would like to have more Grand Slams in the end,” he said, including Djokovic. “But on the other hand, both Federer and me have had a career that is better than either of us could have dreamed. I think we see this as a new opportunity for something else in our careers rather than a new opportunity to be comparing ourselves to each other.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But no matter how subtle the psychology of it all on the inside, comparisons remain inevitable for outsiders. For now, Nadal has a 24-15 edge in head-to-head matches, and Federer has a 2-1 edge at Wimbledon, having defeated Nadal in the<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/10/sports/tennis/10tennis.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> 2006</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/09/sports/tennis/09tennis.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">2007</a> finals before losing in the gloaming in 2008.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There will be no need to fret about fading light on Friday. Centre Court, like No. 1 Court, is now equipped with a retractable roof and lights.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Much has changed at the All England Club in 11 years, but Federer and Nadal have endured, together.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think it’s no coincidence that they are both playing at this advanced age,” Wertheim said. “This living, breathing rivalry prolongs both their careers.”</p>',\n",

They were built to a specification mandated by the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Internationale_de_l%27Automobile\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile</a>, the organization that developed Formula E and manages it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Only one team, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://group.renault.com/en/news/blog-renault/e-dams-the-renault-formula-e-team/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">E.dams Renault</a>, was affiliated with an automaker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Each team was allotted two drivers and each driver two cars. To accommodate a long race, it was either switch the battery or swap cars, and swapping out cars was faster.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The chassis, motor and battery for all the cars were specified by series management. Power was limited to a meager 200 kilowatts, about 268 horsepower, and the top speed was a ho-hum 140 miles per hour. A Formula One car, for comparison, produces about 850 horsepower from a 1.6-liter engine and energy recovery system and is capable of about 210 m.p.h. Nascar entrants generate about 800 horsepower from a much larger engine and can reach about 200 m.p.h.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To stimulate fan interest, Formula E organizers created Fanboost, which enabled enthusiasts to vote for their favorite driver. The top vote getters gained a power boost that could be used at any time during the race. Fanboost remains a part of Formula E, and drivers post Twitter messages and maintain Facebook pages to lobby for votes. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Because the cars were identical in the inaugural season, success was a matter of driver skill, with engineering and preparation playing minor roles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The F.I.A. loosened its grip for Season 2, and teams were allowed to develop drivetrain components, including the electric motor, the inverter that converts the battery’s DC charge to AC, the cooling system and the gearbox. The chassis, the battery and the motor’s power output were still controlled by the F.I.A., and car swaps during the race remained necessary. The rules remained largely unchanged for the next two seasons.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And now Season 5 is heading toward its finish this weekend in Brooklyn. It began in December with a refreshed rule book governing car design and the races.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What’s more, the Formula E circuit finally caught the attention of a number of electric-vehicle manufacturers. Jaguar, BMW, Audi and Nissan fielded racecars, with Nissan replacing Renault. Mercedes-Benz and Porsche will begin competing in Season 6, kicking off in late 2019.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So far, no American makers are involved. “We would love to see a U.S. automaker participate in Formula E.,” an F.I.A. spokesman said. <!-- -->“We’ve tried to lure Ford in.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ford has no plans to compete in Formula E racing but is watching how the series develops, a company spokesman, Sam Schembari, said. No other automaker based in the United States has indicated interest.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In this fifth season, the second-generation Formula E racecar arrived. Fitted with a halo-style roll bar and no rear wing, the car is unique to the series. Power was increased from 200 kilowatts to 250, or roughly 335 horsepower, and battery capacity got a big bump, so a midrace swap of cars is no longer necessary.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The cars can now reach 174 m.p.h. on straightaways and accelerate from zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. As before, race officials enforce power and battery capacity limits by electronically monitoring the cars as they race, a kind of real-time steroid test for the competitors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This season also introduced attack mode. By driving through an activation zone, drivers gain a 33-horsepower increase. The number of times a driver can arm attack mode and how long it will last are announced by the F.I.A. an hour before the race, so teams must figure out their strategy quickly. Fans can tell when a driver has activated attack mode because the car’s halo glows blue. If Fanboost is activated, it glows magenta. All in the cause of fan involvement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The series is attracting a modest level of fan interest, but attendance varies by country. The e-prix in Mexico City drew 35,000 fans, while the event in Marrakesh, Morocco, played out before only a handful of spectators.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Will technology developed for Formula E be passed down to passenger cars? BMW, on its <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.bmw-motorsport.com/en/topics/fascination-i/Formula-E.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Formula E website</a>, said its iFE.18 Formula E car shared software for its drive system with future road-going BMW electric vehicles. It said this “underlines the intense knowledge transfer between production development and motor racing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Toto Wolff, head of the Mercedes <!-- -->motorsports<!-- --> operation, said aiding passenger car development was an important part of the brand’s auto racing activities. Specialists in England are leading the development of the Mercedes Formula E car, but they exchange information with engineers in Germany.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Motorsport is the fastest and most intensive learning laboratory in the world,” Mr. Wolff said. “Formula One has generated a lot of learning for passenger car development, and Formula E will do so in the future as well.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Wolff cited energy management and brake-by-wire as technology that is of critical importance to Formula One, Formula E and passenger cars. Brake-by-wire is shared by racecars and some advanced road machines. Rather than relying on hydraulic pressure and mechanical linkage to apply the brakes, these digitally driven systems use a computer to interpret pedal pressure and operate the brakes. Formula One adapted this technology in 2014, and the second-generation Formula E cars now use it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The fully electric Audi e-tron sport utility vehicle, which will be introduced late this year, was engineered with brake-by-wire, as was the Audi racecar, said Allan McNish, a former racecar driver and team principal for Audi’s Formula E effort.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We won the Formula E race in Mexico City earlier this year because we were able to recoup more energy through regenerative braking than our competition,” Mr. McNish said. “There are limits set by F.I.A. in respect to the technology, but we’ve worked hard to refine the software.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“From the time I joined Audi,” he added,” I learned that whatever we did had to apply to road cars. Hybrid technology, direct injection, brake-by-wire, they’re applicable both on the highway and the racetrack.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now that big carmakers are fielding teams, Formula E is likely to be pressed to allow additional power and performance upgrades. Yet there is also pressure to control costs and allow independent teams to realistically compete. No one wants to see Formula E graduate to the nine-figure budgets that Formula One teams require. Thus, small steps are expected.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An F.I.A. spokesman said technology employed in the series would advance in concert with that of electric passenger cars. “We want to continue to develop performance and range,” he said.</p>',\n",

Religious texts say <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.templeinstitute.org/incense.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">rabbis burned it as offerings in</a> Jerusalem’s temples, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/people-cultures-in-the-bible/people-in-the-bible/the-three-magi/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">three biblical Magi gifted it to the newborn Jesus Christ</a> and the Prophet Muhammad<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=pjn.2009.1472.1479\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> prescribed it for fumigating houses and treating numerous ailments</a>. It was also a staple in ancient Chinese medicine.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today its smoke still permeates centers of worship and Ethiopian coffee ceremonies. Demand is also increasing in the West: It’s found in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/lionheart-natural-herbs-and-spices-brooklyn?osq=Incense+Stores\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">natural medicine</a> stores, spiritual shops, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.enfleurage.com/frankincense_Page/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">bespoke boutiques</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.doterra.com/US/en/search/fullsearch?text=frankincense&amp;contentType=PRODUCT&amp;saveSearch=true\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">online</a>. Sephora, the big chain beauty store, sells essential oil and expensive perfumes that contain it, like Chanel No. 5. Just down the block from a Sephora in Downtown Brooklyn, Tea Brown, co-owner of a traveling spiritual shop called <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/teaonmarsbk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Tea on Mars</a>, sells bags of the gnarled, golden resin from Somalia. It’s so popular, she says, she has to restock it daily. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But her customers shouldn’t take its availability for granted: Frankincense may not be around much longer, warns a study <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0322-2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">published Monday in Nature Sustainability</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The first time I said something about frankincense being under threat, there was panic,” said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.wur.nl/en/Persons/Frans-prof.dr.-FJJM-Frans-Bongers.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Frans Bongers</a>, an ecologist at Wageningen University and Research in the Netherlands who led the study. “I got a lot of people asking me about it,” <!-- -->including Catholic clergy <!-- -->and top suppliers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Frankincense, or olibanum, is an aromatic resin used in incense, perfumes and natural medicines. It comes from Boswellia, a genus of trees and shrubs endemic to the Horn of Africa, Arabian Peninsula and parts of India.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When frankincense tappers make gashes into some species of mature Boswellia’s woody skin, sap seeps out like blood from a wound. It dries into a scab of resin, which is harvested and sold raw, or turned into oil or incense.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Frankincense is exported by the thousands of<!-- --> tons<!-- --> each year. But as demand increases, <!-- -->over-exploitation<!-- --> and ecosystem degradation are bringing populations to the brink of collapse. The study’s authors estimate that without new trees to replace the old, half the intact forests — and half the frankincense they produce — will be gone within 20 years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To find out its status, Dr. Bongers and colleagues surveyed <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/taxonomydetail.aspx?id=310554#Economic\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Boswellia papyrifera</a> — the species responsible for most of the world’s frankincense — in Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Darfur. The trees were old and dying, and most hadn’t produced a young tree in half a century. Models suggested that with no intervention, populations would collapse. Other Boswellia species face similar threats.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The problem, they found, was more people. They burn forests for agriculture and allow livestock that eat saplings to graze in forests. And increasing demand has incentivized poor tree tappers, who make only a tiny percentage of frankincense profit and rely on it for income, to take as much resin as they can in a short amount of time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That leaves overtapped trees that are weak and vulnerable to pests and early death before a new generation can replace them. Despite adult trees producing plenty of seeds, researchers seldom found any new saplings, let alone newly matured trees. Others are too weak to produce enough quality seeds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But it’s not hopeless, Dr. Bonger said. Populations can be restored by planting more trees, ceasing burning and building fences to block livestock. Sustainable tapping regulations should be created, taught and enforced, he added, and international trade limited. Buyers at all levels of the supply chain should emphasize quality and sustainable harvesting over quantity to reduce overtapping. And consumers can continue demanding sustainable, socially conscious products.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.uvm.edu/ieds/node/284\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Anjanette DeCarlo</a>, an environmentalist at the University of Vermont, who was not involved in the study, has <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2017/04/20/inside-africa-tracking-down-the-frankincense-tree-in-somalia-c.cnn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">worked with frankincense in Somaliland</a>.

       " 'fresh-water-shortage-invest': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Water is easy to take for granted. It falls from the sky, and, though it’s vital, we sometimes treat it as if it’s worthless. How often have you seen sprinklers running in the rain?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet the prospect of shortages in the years ahead could make water a precious commodity. That represents an opportunity for investors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A small group of traditional mutual funds and exchange-traded funds already invest in it, mainly in companies that contribute to the delivery, testing and cleaning of potable water. Those companies stand to grow as governments around the globe strive to stem the expected water shortfalls.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Water scarcity is a global phenomenon,” said Andreas M. Fruschki, portfolio manager of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://us.allianzgi.com/en-us/products-solutions/mutual-funds/allianzgi-global-water-fund-a-awtax\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">AllianzGI Global Water Fund</a>. “And it’s most pronounced in regions with the highest population growth,” like the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Population growth, climate change and pollution are disrupting the world’s freshwater supplies. The United Nations Environment Program has predicted that half the globe’s population could face severe water stress by 2030. Annual expenditures of $200 billion, up from a historical average of about $40 billion to $45 billion, are needed now to keep spigots running, the U.N. said in a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/half-world-face-severe-water-stress-2030-unless-water-use-decoupled\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">2016 report</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even developed countries face rising costs to deliver water, because water is heavy and hard to move long distances. “Rain in New York doesn’t help Southern California,” Mr. Fruschki said. On top of this, much of the water infrastructure in the developing world is antiquated and overdue to be replaced, he said. That’s leading to water-main breaks across the United States and the loss of two trillion gallons a year of drinking water, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers’ <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/drinking_water/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">2017 Infrastructure Report Card</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The 35 companies held by the AllianzGI fund provide products or services to help overcome water scarcity and remedy infrastructure shortcomings, Mr. Fruschki said. The fund’s largest holding, American Water Works, is a utility that operates in 16 states, including New York and New Jersey. Another top holding, Xylem, supplies a spate of water technologies as diverse as pumps and smart meters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A quirk of this sector is that, though water is a commodity, it can’t be bought directly in the way many other commodities can be. “It’s not a tradable good like oil,” Mr. Fruschki said. Australia has a water market, called <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.waterfind.com.au/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Waterfind</a>. But in the United States, betting on the price of water requires buying land that has water rights associated with it. Harvard University’s endowment, for example, has <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/4/13/water-harvard-vineyards/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">bought up California vineyards</a> and thus acquired control of their water rights.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Created in 2008, the AllianzGI fund returned an annual average of 9.83 percent over the 10 years that ended in June, compared with 5.37 percent for its average Morningstar peer. The fund is unusual in this niche in that it’s actively managed. The bulk of the water mutual funds and E.T.F.s available to retail investors track indexes and are not actively managed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Take the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.calvert.com/Calvert-Global-Water-Fund-CFWAX.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Calvert Global Water Fund</a>. It’s built upon an index that the fund’s sponsor, Calvert Research and Management, created to include not just companies that help supply potable water but also big users with exemplary practices, said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/business/these-funds-aim-to-power-their-returns-with-clean-energy.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Jade S. Huang</a>, a vice president and environmental, social and governance portfolio manager for Calvert. While the fund owns American Water Works and Xylem, it also counts Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing among its 111 holdings.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Taiwan is a water-scarce area, so Taiwan Semiconductor has developed innovative practices,” Ms. Huang said. “They recapture, refilter and reuse their water three times.” Semiconductor plants gulp down huge quantities of water, and, though Taiwan receives plenty of rainfall, it has little ability to store it. Ms. Huang said Calvert views smart water handling as prudent risk management for chip-makers like Taiwan Semiconductor. “It puts them in a better position competitively, and they’re a market leader in the semiconductor space.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The companies in the Calvert index are divided into four subgroups — utilities, infrastructure outfits, technology providers and efficient users like Taiwan Semiconductor. Each group accounts for a quarter of the fund’s assets, Ms. Huang said. The fund returned an annual average of 8.56 percent over the 10 years that ended in June.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For water E.T.F.s, Invesco is the dominant player, with three offerings. Two of its funds — <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.invesco.com/portal/site/us/investors/etfs/product-detail?productId=PHO\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Invesco Water Resources E.T.F.</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.invesco.com/portal/site/us/financial-professional/etfs/product-detail?productId=pio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Invesco Global Water E.T. F.</a> — are constructed around Nasdaq indexes. The holdings of the former are focused on the United States, while those of the latter are spread around the world, though companies listed in the United States account for about half its assets. The former fund returned an annual average of 9.89 percent over the decade that ended in June, while the latter returned an annual average of 8.1 percent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Invesco acquired its third offering, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.invesco.com/portal/site/us/financial-professional/etfs/product-detail?productId=CGW&amp;ticker=CGW&amp;title=invesco-s-p-global-water-index-etf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">S&amp;P Global Water Index E.T.F.</a>, when it bought Guggenheim’s line of E.T.F.s last year. Like Water Resources, this fund also invests mainly in the United States, but the two aren’t twins, said J. Jason Bloom, senior director of Global Macro E.T.F. Strategy at Invesco. Water Resources has “more focus on companies developing technology around delivering clean water,” while the S&amp;P index fund leans more toward utilities, which make up about half of its assets, he said. The S&amp;P Global Water Index fund returned an annual average of 11.05 percent for the decade that ended in June.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two other aqueous E.T.F.s are the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ftportfolios.com/retail/etf/etfsummary.aspx?Ticker=FIW\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">First Trust Water E.T.F.</a> and the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://etp.tortoiseadvisors.com/funds/tortoise-global-water-esg-fund/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Tortoise Global Water E.S.G. Fund</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One way water investments differ from those in some other sectors is their greater exposure to regulatory and political risk. In the developed world, water supplies are often closely regulated, and in the United States, governments are both big customers and potential competitors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That’s why a fund’s diversification, especially its country diversification, matters, Mr. Bloom said. Even if the United States were to tighten water regulation, other countries wouldn’t necessarily follow.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Matthew C. Sheldon, senior portfolio manager for water strategy at KBI Global Investors in Boston, said, “Different investors come to water from different angles. Some are looking to dilute their other natural-resource exposures. Others are looking for an infrastructure play. Some have a strong interest in environmental, social and governance investing. Some just want a diversifier.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An internal <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.kbiglobalinvestors.com/_fileupload/Do%20Water%20Stocks%20Hedge%20Water%20Risks(1).pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">analysis conducted by KBI</a> found that adding a water E.T.F. to an already diverse portfolio both increased its overall return and reduced its risk.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But water wagers create ethical quandaries for some investors, said Monika J. Freyman, director for investor engagement, water, at Ceres, a Boston nonprofit. “Water’s needed for life itself,” she said. “So if you’re jacking up rates, you are going to run into social justice issues. Do you turn off a poor family’s water?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some investors shy from the sector because “a lot of people see publicly traded water utilities as water privatizers,” said Julie K. Gorte, senior vice president for sustainable investing at Impax Asset Management. Water, in this view, should be publicly owned and controlled to ensure that everyone has access to it. In reality, “municipalities often contract with water utilities” and regulate their service provision, Ms. Gorte said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Robert Glennon, a water-law expert at the University of Arizona’s Rogers College of Law, said some of the distrust of private-sector control of water supplies may stem from misunderstandings of what customers pay for and where most fresh water goes. “Water may be a gift from God, but God doesn’t give us pipes, and pipes are expensive,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Household water accounts for only a small portion of water consumption — in the United States, about 7 percent, Professor Glennon said. The rest is used by farms and industry. And they have little incentive to use it prudently because nearly everyone in the United States pays little for water, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Our water supply is like a giant milkshake, and each diversion is a straw in the glass. People have a sense of our water supply as infinite, but in reality, it’s finite and exhaustible,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Economists, starting with Adam Smith, have long pondered the diamond-water paradox. Simply put, it’s the puzzle that fresh water is essential for life but cheap, while diamonds are a mere ornament but costly. The difference, of course, was water’s abundance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today, Mr. Smith might still be flummoxed by the price of diamonds, but investment possibilities of water he might attribute to his favorite market forces: supply and demand.</p>',\n",

       " 'greece-storms-halkidiki': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At least seven people died and more than 100 were injured after intense thunderstorms hit northern Greece, tearing out tall pine trees and destroying houses in their passing, officials said on Thursday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The area affected, Halkidiki, is a peninsula with sandy beaches that is popular with tourists. Thessaloniki, the second-biggest city in Greece, is just to the north.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Kostas Pahinis, fire brigade commander for Central Macedonia, the region that includes Halkidiki, said by phone on Thursday that the storms had been so severe that a kind of tornado had developed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is the first time this has happened to us,” Mr. Pahinis said. “It ripped out more than 500 trees,” he added.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The fire service said that a warning about winds and rain had been issued but that the intensity of the storms had been totally unexpected.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Six of those who died were foreign nationals, Mr. Pahinis said, with the count of those injured at 102.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At about 10 p.m. Wednesday, residents and vacationers were forced to seek cover when a strong wind began blowing across the region, carrying away beach umbrellas and aluminum roofs. The sudden change came as a surprise to many, after several days of clear, hot weather.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An older Czech couple died when the wind blew away their camping trailer, while a 54-year-old Romanian woman and her 8-year-old son were killed on the beach after the roof of a nearby taverna collapsed in Nea Plagia, a small, seaside area in the western part of Halkidiki, according to fire brigade officials.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A Russian man and his 2-year-old son died after a tree collapsed near Potidea Palace, a four-star hotel in which they were staying, the officials said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a message of condolence on Twitter on Thursday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The fire service in Polygyros, the capital of Halkidiki, received more than 600 calls for help on Wednesday night and early Thursday morning, according to the Greek fire service website, while 140 firefighters, 44 firefighting vehicles, 21 ambulances and a doctor in a mobile unit were deployed. A state of emergency was also declared.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Melina Meletlidou said she was in Nea Potidea, a seaside town in the western part of the Halkidiki Peninsula, when the storm hit. At about 9:30 p.m., Ms. Meletlidou, her husband, their two children and her sister drove back from dinner at a taverna nearby to the house they had rented, she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was so hot that they had to turn on the air-conditioning during their short drive, Ms. Meletlidou remembered. “Nothing suggested what would follow,” she said by phone on Thursday, adding that, half an hour later, the weather had changed completely.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The wind was so strong that we were trying to close the windows but it kept throwing us back,” she said. Soon, power was out, and objects from inside and outside the house were flying around.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The wooden ceiling was creaking, the windows broke, water was running on the walls, tree branches and roof tiles were coming in through the windows,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The strong wind and downpour lasted about 15 minutes, according to Ms. Meletlidou. “But to us it felt like eternity,” she added. “We felt like we were going to die.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another vacationer, the Rev. Ioannis Zezios, who had traveled to Halkidiki from his home in Nymphaion, a village in northwestern Greece, said by phone on Thursday that huge trees had been “ripped in half,” while “electricity pylons fell to the ground.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It started raining, thundering and lightning, and then everything happened in 15 minutes,” he added. Some areas also received hail, according to Dimitris Karasavvidis, the fire brigade commander for Halkidiki.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Charalampos Stergiadis, the head of civil protection in Central Macedonia, said by phone on Thursday that the streets were being cleared of fallen trees and debris, and efforts were underway to reinstate power in all houses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re trying to preserve life as it was,” he said. “It was an unprecedented phenomenon.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Zanis Prodromos, a professor of meteorology and climatology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, said the storms had been “definitely an extreme phenomenon.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said that Halkidiki had been struck by a “mesoscale convective system” — a collection of thunderstorms — that operated in high wind speeds. It was not unusual for whirlwinds to develop as part of a mesoscale convective system, he added.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Though climate change cannot be directly blamed for extreme weather, warming temperatures do increase the likelihood of such phenomena, Professor Prodromos said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Almost a year ago, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/world/europe/greece-fire-deaths.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">deadly wildfires swept another seaside area</a>, Mati, a settlement in southern Greece outside Athens, killing more than 100.</p>',\n",

       " 'hawaii-telescope-tmt-mauna-kea': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Gov. David Ige of Hawaii announced on Wednesday that construction will begin next week on a giant telescope on the summit of Mauna Kea, the volcano that looms over the Big Island of Hawaii.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The announcement was widely expected after a series of court rulings in recent years had gone the embattled telescope’s way. “We have followed a 10-year process to get to this point,” Mr. Ige said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He was flanked at a news conference by Henry Yang, the chancellor of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and chair of the Thirty Meter Telescope International Observatory. “We have learned much about the unique importance of Mauna Kea to all,” Dr. Yang said. “Hawaii is a very special place that has long honored the arts of astronomy and navigation.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added, “We would like to acknowledge those who disagree with this project and their right to voice their disagreement.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Thirty Meter Telescope<!-- --> will be the largest telescope in the Northern Hemisphere, with a primary mirror bigger than a basketball court, and one of the most expensive: According to knowledgeable, unaffiliated astronomers, its costs could reach $2 billion. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/science/hawaii-thirty-meter-telescope-mauna-kea.html?searchResultPosition=6&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">the project has been plagued with controversy</a> and a series of legal and illegal obstacles. Activists have opposed it, saying that decades of telescope-building on Mauna Kea have polluted the mountain. In 2014, protesters disrupted a groundbreaking ceremony and<!-- --> blocked construction vehicles from mountain<!-- --> roads.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mauna Kea is considered “ceded land” that once belonged to the Hawaiian kingdom and is now held in trust for native Hawaiians. Some of them have contended that the construction of telescopes on the mountain’s summit — 13 so far — has interfered with cultural and religious practices. For others, the telescope project has become a symbol of Western colonization. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2018/03/26/hawaii-news/poll-shows-strong-public-support-for-thirty-meter-telescope/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">poll last year</a> by The Honolulu Star-Advertiser found that 72 percent of native Hawaiians supported the telescope, and that 15 percent opposed it. The general support, they say, is befitting the heritage of a people who traditionally navigated the Pacific by the winds, tides and stars. Many say they hope the telescope will bring technological and economic development to the island.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The telescope would be built by an international collaboration called the TMT International Observatory, led by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, but also including Japan, China, India and Canada.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This week a coalition of activists led by Kealoha Pisciotta filed a legal challenge in the Third Circuit Court of Hawaii, seeking an injunction against the telescope construction. The TMT International Observatory, the activists said, had failed to post a security bond that is required under a 1977 plan that governs the management of the mountain. The bond, in the amount of the full cost of the project, would cover the cost of restoring the site to its natural state once the telescope has finished its mission.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“By failing to post the bond, they have laid all financial liability on the People of Hawai’i, in the event the TMT doesn’t get full funding,” Ms. Pisciotta said in an email. “And this is especially important because they don’t have full funding now.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an email, Douglas Ing, a lawyer for the observatory, said: “We had a brief opportunity to review an unfiled copy of a lawsuit. We believe this is a weak lawsuit and we expect to defeat it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is only the latest chapter in a long series of protests and legal skirmishes. In December 2015, the state’s Supreme Court invalidated a previous construction permit on the grounds that the project’s opponents had been deprived of due process. A state board had granted the permit before the opponents could be heard in a so-called contested case hearing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The TMT astronomers said they would build their telescope in the Canary Islands if denied in Hawaii. Last October, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/science/hawaii-telescope-mauna-kea.html?searchResultPosition=5&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">the Hawaiian Supreme Court restored the telescope’s building permit</a>. Earlier this summer, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/science/telescope-mauna-kea-hawaii.html?searchResultPosition=2&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">Governor Ige announced</a> that a “notice to proceed” had been issued, allowing construction. As part of the deal, five telescopes currently operating on Mauna Kea will be shut down and their sites restored to original condition.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Ige said the environmental reviews required for the decommissioning of two of those telescopes had already begun.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Yang said that it would take 10 years to actually build the telescope but that he did not know an estimate of the total cost. He stressed that the partners in the international collaboration were committed to finishing the project. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Mauna Kea access road that goes up to the summit, which was the scene of protests and blockades last time around, will be severely restricted starting on Monday, Mr. Ige said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are asking people to be safe,” he said. “We ask they be respectful of those who work on this project.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added, “We are being respectful of those who choose to voice their disagreement with this project.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said he was working with the mayor of Hawaii County, Harry Kim, “to achieve a broader vision of Mauna Kea as symbol of peace and international collaboration.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I believe we can find a new way forward,” Mr. Ige said.</p>',\n",

By returning <!-- -->to Earth next year with these specimens, the mission will help scientists seek clues about the solar system’s origins.<!-- --> <!-- --> </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Earlier in the year, the spacecraft used explosives and a projectile to liberate rock from beneath the asteroid’s outer layers. In the latest operation,<!-- --> it descended to the surface of the asteroid before 9:30 p.m. Eastern time, attempting to swiftly grab a sample of material<!-- --> from the crater it made. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pictures posted by the mission’s managers after the landing showed a scattering of rocks as the spacecraft lifted from the asteroid’s surface.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Following the brief landing, the spacecraft returned to a safe position above Ryugu. It is <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/news/schedule/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">scheduled to begin its return to Earth</a> with the samples it collected at the end of the year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Asteroids are bits and pieces leftover from the disc of gas and dust that formed around the young sun and never quite coalesced into a planet. They contain some almost pristine compounds that help tell what the early solar system was like 4.5 billion years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ryugu, as dark as coal, is a C-type, or carbonaceous, asteroid, meaning it is full of carbon molecules known as organics including possibly amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Such molecules are not always associated with biology and can form from chemical reactions in deep space, but asteroids could have seeded Earth with the organic matter that led to life.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About three-quarters of asteroids in the solar system fall into the C-type.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This space rock was discovered in 1999 and not given a name until 2015. Ryugu is named after Ryugu-jo, or dragon’s palace — a magical undersea palace in a Japanese folk tale.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hayabusa2 already has landed briefly on Ryugu’s surface, in February, and collected samples. But these surface materials have been exposed to the solar system’s weather. Studying them offers scientists a potential picture of Ryugu’s surface. But that debris won’t reveal much about the asteroid’s geological history, just as the topsoil in your yard won’t tell you much about what your neighborhood was like during the last ice age.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Making a crater will offer clues to how asteroids similar to Ryugu respond to being struck by objects.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To create the dent in Ryugu, Hayabusa2 carried an impactor made of copper. According to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/what-to-expect-hayabusa2-sci.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the Planetary Society</a>, a funnel containing plastic explosives hurled the copper projectile into the asteroid’s surface. The blast scattered material above the asteroid, altering an area with <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/enjoy/material/press/Hayabusa2_Press20190509_ver6_en4.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a diameter of just over 30 feet and creating a crater with depth of about 6 to 10 feet</a>. The impact also darkened the region and caused some boulders to move.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In short, very quickly.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To collect material from the surface of the asteroid, Hayabusa2 <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20190708e_PPTD_approach3/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">targeted a small patch about 65 feet from the crater</a> it created, not within the crater itself. The mission’s scientists think this spot is covered in material ejected from beneath the crater when the blast occurred.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The spacecraft tried to pull samples in through a device called a sampler horn, after firing a small projectile made of the metal tantalum — basically a bullet — at the asteroid’s surface. The landing, bullet firing and attempted collection took about one second, according to the Planetary Society. Hayabusa2 then rose from the surface and returned to a safe distance near Ryugu.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hayabusa2 already did this once in February. Because of that successful operation, the mission’s managers in Japan had to assess whether it was worth risking the spacecraft again. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After the spacecraft made low-altitude observations of the landing area in the first half of June, the team concluded that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/enjoy/material/press/Hayabusa2_Press20190625_ver5_en2.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">conditions were safe enough for a second landing</a>, and that the scientific value of collecting subsurface materials from the asteroid merited the try.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yes. The Osiris-Rex spacecraft is currently surveying another carbon-rich asteroid known as Bennu, and it too will collect samples and return them to Earth <!-- -->(although it will not be making any craters on Bennu’s surface)<!-- -->. Bennu is even smaller than Ryugu, about 500 yards wide. Osiris-rex will not return with its samples until 2023. Early research results announced in March also revealed that Bennu is more rugged than expected, and that it is <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/science/bennu-ryugu-asteroids.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">shooting rocks from its surface into space</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">NASA and Japanese scientists plan to exchange samples of the two asteroids to compare the similarities and differences.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the 2 in Hayabusa2 indicates, this is the second time that JAXA, the Japanese space agency, has sent a spacecraft to an asteroid.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hayabusa2 is an improved version of Hayabusa, which visited a stony asteroid, Itokawa, in 2005. Despite several technical problems at Itokawa, Hayabusa returned a capsule to Earth in 2010 containing 1,500 particles from the asteroid.</p>',\n",

Its grid of 18th-century streets contains scores of houses built before the American Revolution, and dozens more that are almost as old.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s incredible to walk around a neighborhood like this that is so intact,” Mark Thompson said one morning this spring as he strolled along Washington Street, past the Jahleel Brenton Counting House, the 200-year-old home of a prosperous merchant. “There is a very organic feel to the neighborhood.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Thompson heads the Newport Restoration Foundation, one of the organizations that in recent decades have purchased and restored many of Newport’s historic properties, saving them from the tourism development that has overtaken much of the city’s waterfront.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today, the neighborhood faces a new threat. The Point sits only a few feet above sea level, and because of climate change, the ocean is rising. So people have been thinking again about how to preserve the neighborhood.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Similar efforts are underway in many communities on the East Coast, where European colonists settled centuries ago. The task is complicated, and success is far from assured.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[Read about </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/science/farnsworth-house-flooding.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">efforts to protect the Farnsworth House</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">, a midcentury marvel in Plano, Ill., from rising floodwaters.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">According to a 2014 report by the Union of Concerned Scientists, sea level rise threatens sites ranging from Faneuil Hall, where the Sons of Liberty planned the Boston Tea Party, to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/science/nasa-is-facing-a-climate-change-countdown.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the launchpads of Cape Canaveral</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The National Park Service says a quarter of its properties are on or near the coast, and most of them contain historic structures — many of them Civil War forts vulnerable to sea level rise.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2016, the N.R.F. organized a conference, “Keeping History Above Water,” to address the problem of historic properties being threatened by sea level rise. The Point was its case study. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since then, experts in preservation have gathered in Annapolis, Md., whose Colonial Annapolis Historic District is threatened; in St. Augustine, Fla., where the Castillo de San Marcos, a 17th-century fort built of light and porous coquina limestone, is highly vulnerable; and last month in Nantucket. That entire island is designated a National Historic District, and much of it is subject to flooding and erosion.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wherever the threat occurs, the underlying problem is much the same: Tactics used in ordinary contexts — building sea walls, raising buildings on stilts, or even moving them to higher ground — are of limited utility in historic neighborhoods. They can destroy the very characteristics that make the properties worth saving.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So architects, planners and engineers are devising novel approaches, such as allowing water to flow through threatened structures; turning basements into cisterns; installing building-size flotation systems; or re-plumbing entire neighborhoods to direct storm water and high tides out of the way.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">FLOOR </p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">LEVEL</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">FLOOD WATER</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">BASEMENT FILL</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">FLOOD VENTS</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">FLOOD VENTS</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">FLOOD WATER</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">FLOOR </p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">LEVEL</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">FLOOD VENTS</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">BASEMENT FILL</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">FLOOD VENTS</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">FLOOD </p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">WATER</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">FLOOD VENTS</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By Mika Gröndahl</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There is a definite urgency,” said Mr. Thompson. “We certainly don’t feel we have a luxury of time.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The tobacco heiress Doris Duke, who inherited a Gilded Age estate as a young woman in 1925 and kept it until her death in 1993, created the N.R.F. in 1968. Since then, the foundation has acquired and restored scores of Colonial-era properties, which it rents to “stewards” who agree to care for them according to foundation standards.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The aim is to preserve the buildings not as silent relics or museum exhibits, but as vital parts of vibrant communities. More than two dozen foundation properties, including the Jahleel Brenton Counting House, are in The Point.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Point was settled in the 17th century by Quaker refugees from Massachusetts. Then, it was little more than a spit of land sticking out into what became Newport Harbor. Soon, as its edges were filled in, a marsh became Marsh Street, and a wet area became Water Street; the path of a span that once linked The Point to the rest of Newport turned into Bridge Street.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Newport grew prosperous through trading, including a substantial slave trade. The city — and The Point — supported a vibrant class of artisans, one of whom was Christopher Townsend, a member of a prominent family of furniture makers. In 1725, he built a two-story house at 74 Bridge Street; the restoration foundation acquired it in 2013.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To prepare for the 2016 conference, Union Studio, an architecture and community planning concern in Providence, R.I., conducted an “adaptation workshop” that considered an array of possible approaches to the preservation of historic structures in general — and 74 Bridge Street in particular.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The ideas included so-called “dry flood-proofing,” more complicated “wet flood-proofing,” altering the grade of the surrounding landscape, and making structures buoyant.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So far, 74 Bridge Street, which is unoccupied, relies on dry flood-proofing, a combination of relatively simple steps. Sandbags and door barriers are deployed when floods threaten, and its water heater, furnace and other mechanical equipment have been moved from the cellar to the first floor. (There is a space heater in the cellar, but it is bolted to the ceiling.)</p><p class=\"css-1vs7yia interactive-leadin\" data-testid=\"leadin\" id=\"interactive-leadin\">Basements can be turned into cisterns to collect floodwater and slowly release it into the stormwater system once the flood has passed. Entire neighborhoods can be equipped with larger capacity storm water pipes, or houses can be made to float on the rising floodwater.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Replumbing</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Flotation</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Cistern</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">GUIDE POSTS</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">FLOODWATER TANK</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">LARGER STORM- </p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">WATER PIPE</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">FLOTATION DEVICE</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Replumbing</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Flotation</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Cistern</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">GUIDE </p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">POSTS</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">LARGER </p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">STORM- </p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">WATER PIPE</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">FLOODWATER TANK</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">FLOTATION DEVICE</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Cistern</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">FLOODWATER TANK</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Replumbing</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">LARGER STORM- </p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">WATER PIPE</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Flotation</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">GUIDE POSTS</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">FLOTATION DEVICE</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-source\" data-testid=\"source\" id=\"interactive-source\">Source: Historyabovewater.org</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By Mika Gröndahl</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It helps that 74 Bridge Street was built in a fashion common in Colonial-era New England, with heavy, vertical planks attached to the building’s wooden frame. This plank-on-frame construction is relatively resilient to minor flooding, preservationists say. Plus, its interior walls were finished with lime plaster, a sand-lime-aggregate material in use since ancient times that is durable and mold-resistant.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, a sump pump runs in the basement 24/7. The water table is now so high that without it, there would probably be a foot of standing water there at all times.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dry flood-proofing is “low-hanging fruit,” said Stephanie Zurek, an architect at Union Studio who studied the home. Other remedies, like wet flood-proofing, are more complex.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wet flood-proofing does not involve making basement walls watertight because, the theory goes, foundation walls would be vulnerable to collapse if water pressure built up in the soil around them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Instead, basement walls are left permeable, like the stone foundation walls of 74 Bridge Street. If walls are already watertight, architects may propose flood vents, windowlike devices fitted into cellar walls that open automatically to let the building flood in a storm. Water can be pumped out later.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Or homeowners may install rain barrels or even cisterns in their cellars to store storm water till the threat has passed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Thompson said the foundation is considering whether steps like these might be advisable at 74 Bridge Street, but he added that deliberations may take a while because the foundation hopes to develop techniques that may have wider use. “Whatever we do should inform the community at large,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sometimes, the site of a historic structure can be regraded so that water runs away from it. Unfortunately, this step is generally considered impractical on a neighborhood scale. Though visitors to The Point probably do not notice it, the neighborhood as a whole is “a little bit of a bowl,” as Mr. Thompson put it, and its low point is almost exactly at 74 Bridge Street.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In many coastal districts, including The Point, there is an additional problem: storm sewers that run into nearby rivers or, in the case of Newport, the harbor. In a storm, these outlets can actually send seawater flooding into a historic community like The Point.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Union Studio project put forward a few suggestions for dealing with the problem: setting up a tax district to raise money to redesign the storm sewers, installing tide gates in the outfall pipes, and installing permeable pavement to encourage better draining.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Architects at the Rhode Island School of Design took the idea further, suggesting that streets be designed so that storms can turn them into “a water feature,” said professor Liliane Wong, an architect whose specialty is the adaptive reuse of buildings. “The students called them ‘blue streets.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Elevating buildings has become a more common response to the threat of coastal flooding; often, building codes require it. But in historic neighborhoods, elevating individual structures is controversial. The process can turn a harmonious streetscape into an unsightly hodgepodge of rooflines, some far higher than others.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We call it ‘lollipopping,’” said Ms. Wong. Post-Katrina New Orleans experienced “lollipopping at its extreme,” she added, with some buildings raised as much as 20 feet in the air.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That’s exactly anti-historic-neighborhood,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In places like The Point, elevation raises another issue: access. Many structures there were built right up to their lot lines, with front doors opening onto the sidewalk. If a house is elevated, it can be hard to find space for the now-needed front stoop.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The owners of some elevated properties in The Point have solved the problem by building stairs running along the building’s facade to a landing at the new level of the front door. That’s what happened with the house at 70 Bridge Street, built in the 18th century by Christopher Townsend’s son, John.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A number of other houses in The Point have been elevated. “It is concerning to me,” said state Rep. Lauren Carson, who until recently lived in The Point. “I think we are going to lose the streetscape integrity.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By far the most dramatic approach to preserving historic structures involves equipping them with devices to make them buoyant. They would sit on dry land — as long as the land is dry. Only when it is dangerously wet would the buildings be set afloat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A leading advocate for the approach is Elizabeth C. English, an architectural theorist and engineer at the University of Waterloo in Canada and the founder of the Buoyant Foundation Project.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. English believes making houses amphibious can maintain their important architectural features while keeping them dry. To “amphibiate” a structure, she said, it must be hoisted so that engineers can install buoyancy elements and supportive framing under the first floor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Around the world, Dr. English said, empty barrels or even empty plastic water bottles have been used for buoyancy. In Louisiana, where she has tested the approach, she favors polystyrene foam blocks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“And then you have a vertical guidance system,” she said, such as steel pipes driven into the ground near the building’s corners. The building’s frame is attached to these poles with sliding rings or sleeves so that the building remains positioned over its foundation, rising when a flood comes and sinking back into place as waters recede.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We can do telescopic vertical guidance posts,” she said. “It works like the handle on a roll-aboard suitcase.” She added: “Anything that can be elevated can be amphibiated.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. English said the biggest barrier to the use of this technology is the lack of engineering standards, which she is working to develop, as well as a lack of building codes and other regulations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Amphibiating historic structures has yet to find wide use (though it was used in a shotgun house in New Orleans rehabilitated through the efforts of the actor Brad Pitt). But experts like Dr. Wong say the notion must be considered: “We need to think about ideas that seem like they would be unfeasible in order to prepare for the future.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If all else fails, endangered buildings can be moved. The practice has a long history on the coast, common on Cape Cod, the Outer Banks of North Carolina — and in Newport. Some of the houses in Queen Anne Square, in the city’s touristic heart, were moved there, at least one from a neighboring town.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In fact, the Jahleel Brenton Counting House is in The Point because the restoration foundation moved it there decades ago, literally hours ahead of its planned demolition. Few worried then that the neighborhood would ever be threatened by rising seas.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But moving a house or two is one thing. Relocating an entire neighborhood, especially a neighborhood whose significance derives in large part from its coastal position, is another matter. As Ms. Zurek, the Union Studio architect, put it: “Whatever the solutions they choose to make or not make, there are going to be huge financial repercussions.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Increasingly, experts and residents alike realize that it may not be possible to prevent rising seas from drowning treasured buildings, neighborhoods and landscapes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The architects at the R.I.S.D. project developed a poignant response: a plan to cast the facades of threatened buildings in concrete. The casts would be used to create a kind of water garden “memory park,” Ms. Wong said. Once the buildings washed away, the casts would remain, reminders of what had been lost.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We cannot save everything,” she said. “But we can have a memory of it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a memorandum issued in 2014, Jonathan B. Jarvis, then director of the National Park Service, wrote about the preservation of the nation’s cultural heritage in an era of climate change. Done sensitively, adaptations of historic structures can preserve their integrity, said Mr. Jarvis, who retired in 2017.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But, he added, managers must recognize the possibility that some historically or culturally important properties may be doomed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Funding temporary repairs for resources that cannot, because of their location or fragility, be saved for the long term demands careful thought,” he wrote.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It may be better to document the properties — with photographs or charts, for example — and allow “them to fall into ruin rather than rebuilding after major storms.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Thompson of the restoration foundation said he could not agree.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Doris Duke did a wonderful thing fifty-some years ago when she preserved these Colonial houses,” he said. “Here we are 50 years later, and it is our responsibility to ensure that the work she did is not lost. To do for Newport a second time what she did for Newport the first time — to save these Colonial properties.”</p>',\n",

The study also found, though, that other types of distractions, such as podcasts, may not have the same effect.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">High-intensity interval workouts are quite popular at the moment, touted by trainers, coaches, scientists and this column as a way to exercise effectively without investing much time. Consisting of brief bursts of taxing effort interspersed with rest, high-intensity interval training, or H.I.I.T., can often improve people’s health and fitness to about the same extent as sustained jogging or similar training, studies show, but in a fraction of the time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These workouts are intense, however, by definition, and some people find them intimidating or physically unpleasant. A few past studies suggest that people who are new to exercise are especially prone to dislike or avoid high-intensity training.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Understanding this hesitancy, some H.I.I.T. researchers have begun to wonder how intense workouts might be made more tolerable and appealing. Music is one obvious possibility. A wealth of past science suggests that listening to music changes how we experience exercise of all types, nudging us to feel less bored or tired and more motivated.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These studies have not focused on novice and perhaps reluctant exercisers trying their first H.I.I.T. sessions, though. So, for the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1469029219302031\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">new study, which was published last month in Psychology of Sport &amp; Exercise</a>, researchers from the University of British Columbia at Okanagan decided to focus on precisely that group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They first recruited 24 adult men and women who rarely exercised, invited them to a university exercise lab, fitted them with heart rate monitors, and introduced them to the one-minute workout. This approach to H.I.I.T. is among the briefest, involving three, 20-second spurts of all-out exertion — on stationary bicycles, in this experiment — with two minutes of recovery between each interval.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The volunteers were told the study would track their emotional and physiological responses to H.I.I.T. They were told nothing about music. But before one of their workouts, a researcher casually asked if the volunteers would mind if he turned on the lab’s speakers. They could choose pop music, rock or hip-hop, the researcher told the volunteers; their pick.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The cyclists decided, the music began and so did the H.I.I.T. session. The up-tempo songs, including “Let’s Go,” by Calvin Harris, and “Can’t Hold Us,” by Macklemore, had been winnowed earlier by other listeners from a set of popular tunes based on which songs the listeners thought were likeliest to get people through workouts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After the session, the volunteers rated how hard the exercise had felt and how much — or little — they had enjoyed it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The volunteers repeated these workouts two additional times, once without music and once while a podcast about the scintillating topic of consumerism played in the background. The researchers aired the podcast to test whether aural distractions besides music affected workouts. During and after each session, the scientists tracked heart rates, power outputs and people’s feelings about the exercise, and then they compared numbers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As a group, the volunteers almost all reported feeling relieved and happy after all three workouts, primarily because they were done. This response is likely to be familiar to anyone who does intervals. It’s a pleasure to be finished.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the volunteers also reported having enjoyed the exercise most when the music was playing, compared to when they heard the podcast or nothing. Surprisingly, they also turned out to have exerted themselves most then. Their heart rates and power outputs were significantly higher during the session with songs than without, even though their subjective rating of the difficulty of the exercise remained constant. In other words, they pedaled harder when music played, but did not feel as if they were doing so.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These findings suggest that up-tempo music may change not just our psychological but also our physical responses to H.I.I.T., says Matthew Stork, a postdoctoral researcher at UBC Okanagan who led the new study.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That the podcast did not affect exercisers in the same way is also interesting, he says, because it indicates that the music did not so much distract exercisers as engulf them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There’s this idea called entrainment,” he says, meaning that our bodies tend to sync with rhythms from the world around us, especially the rhythms of music.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Entraining to the songs, the volunteers would have upped their pedaling to pair it with the musical tempo, he says. They felt no such compulsion when hearing about consumerism.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Of course, this was a small, brief study. It does not show if music can keep people exercising intensely over the long term or if all types of music elicit the same response. “Let’s Go,” for instance, would not be on my playlist. (I currently love “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq2jJLswL8I\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">She’s Kerosene” by the Interrupters</a> and “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPXIgEAGe4U\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">High Hopes” by Panic at the Disco</a> during intervals. Add your favorites in the comments section.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The point is that high-intensity intervals can be a good option for people who do not think they have a lot of time for exercise,” Dr. Stork says, and entraining to Macklemore or your preferred musicians might just make these workouts more palatable.</p>',\n",

The <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.weather.gov/srh/tropical?office=LIX\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">model</a> from the National Hurricane Center also shows the potential for major flooding as far inland as Baton Rouge and southwestern portions of Mississippi. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the video below, the center’s specialists explain what the forecast “cone” is and its limitations. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The cone represents the probable track of just the center of the storm,” one of the specialists, John Cangialosi, says. “The center of the storm stays within the cone for roughly two out of every three forecasts.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The specialists added that hazards associated with a storm usually extend beyond the edge of the cone, and the cone should not be relied on as an indicator of whether to evacuate or not.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About 10 to 15 inches of rain is predicted to fall starting late Thursday night through Sunday. “The rain is going to be there because it’s a very slow-moving storm,” said Freddie Zeigler, a lead forecaster in the New Orleans/Baton Rouge office of the National Weather Service. “Some of the areas that do not usually flood can flood.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/climate/slow-hurricane-florence.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Here’s a look at the dangers of a storm that slows down.</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Mississippi River, already swollen by spring rains, is expected to crest at New Orleans this weekend at close to 20 feet. The city’s levees along the river are between 20 and 25 feet high, according to Ricky Boyett, the spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers in the New Orleans District.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’ll be getting to the top of some of our lower levees if the forecast holds,” he said, cautioning that it was still too early to lock in a prediction.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Boyett said the Corps was trying to identify any low areas and reinforce them. “We’re not concerned with integrity” of the levees, he said, only with how high the water rises.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The wind picked up to tropical storm speeds of at least 39 miles per hour on Thursday morning. The storm could become a hurricane by late Friday, meaning its winds would have reached at least 74 m.p.h. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">National Hurricane Center forecasters also predicted storm surges of three to six feet along the coastal areas.

       " 'ice-families-deport': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nationwide raids to arrest thousands of members of undocumented families have been scheduled to begin Sunday, according to two current and one former homeland security officials, moving forward with a rapidly changing operation, the final details of which remain in flux. The operation, backed by President Trump, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/us/politics/trump-ice-raids.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">had been postponed</a>, partly because of resistance among officials at his own immigration agency.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The raids, which will be conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement over multiple days, will include “collateral” deportations, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the preliminary stage of the operation. In those deportations, the authorities might detain immigrants who happened to be on the scene, even though they were not targets of the raids.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When possible, family members who are arrested together will be held in family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania. But because of space limitations, some might end up staying in hotel rooms until their travel documents can be prepared. ICE’s goal is to deport the families as quickly as possible.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The officials said ICE agents were targeting at least 2,000 immigrants who have been ordered deported — some as a result of their failure to appear in court — but who remain in the country illegally. The operation is expected to take place in at least 10 major cities.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The families being targeted crossed the border recently: The Trump administration expedited their immigration proceedings last fall. In February, many of those immigrants were given notice to report to an ICE office and leave the United States, the homeland security officials said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Matthew Bourke, an ICE spokesman, said in a statement on Wednesday that the agency would not comment on specific details related to enforcement operations, to ensure the safety and security of agency personnel.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The threat of deportation has rattled immigrant communities across the country, prompted backlash from local politicians and police officials and stoked division inside the Department of Homeland Security — the agency that is charged with carrying out the deportations. The Trump administration’s goal is to use the operation as a show of force to deter families from approaching the southwestern border, the officials said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While rare, such coordinated raids have occurred under previous administrations. Agents have expressed apprehensions about arresting babies and young children, officials have said. The agents have also noted that the operation might have limited success because word has already spread among immigrant communities about how to avoid arrest — namely, by refusing to open the door when an agent approaches one’s home. ICE agents are not legally allowed to forcibly enter a home.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Immigration defense lawyers are likely to file motions to reopen the families’ immigration cases, which would significantly delay, if not stop altogether, their removal from the United States.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For weeks last month, the ICE director at the time, Mark Morgan, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/trump-immigration-deportation-family-separation.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">signaled that agents</a> would escalate efforts to round up families. Days before the operation was to begin, Mr. Trump <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/trump-immigration-deportations.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">forecast the plan</a> on Twitter, blindsiding ICE agents whose safety officials feared would be compromised as a result.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In early June, the Department of Homeland Security’s acting secretary, Kevin K. McAleenan, told Mr. Morgan to call off the operation. Mr. McAleenan did not support the raids, officials said at the time, in part out of concern that undocumented parents could be separated from any of their children who are American citizens.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Morgan then directly lobbied Mr. Trump to move forward with the raids. He is <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/politics/mark-morgan-ice-cbp.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">now the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection</a>, another arm of the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a tense meeting with White House officials on June 21, two days before the raids were scheduled to begin, Mr. McAleenan again outlined the challenges of the operation, including the separation of families and the logistics of housing them until they can be removed. If undocumented parents are found to have children who are United States citizens, for example, ICE agents will need to wait with the children in a hotel room until a relative in the United States can claim them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Homeland security officials also worried that many of the families that the administration had hoped to detain might have left the addresses known to ICE after Mr. Trump <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1140791400658870274\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">tweeted the agency’s plans</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Mr. Trump after his tweet and urged him to halt the operation, which in a statement hours later she described as “heartless.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump then tweeted that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/us/politics/trump-ice-raids.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">he would delay the effort</a> at the Democrats’ request. But he <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1142506687020130306\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">also threatened</a> to resume the deportations if Democrats refused to join with Republican lawmakers to “work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Days later, the Senate <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/border-funding-immigration.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">passed a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid package</a> for the border.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Migrant crossings have declined since May, when 144,200 migrants were taken into custody at the southwestern border — a 13-year high.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last Friday, Mr. Trump said the raids would begin “fairly soon.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I say they came in illegally, and we’re bringing them out legally,” the president told reporters.</p>',\n",

They emptied their pockets, stepped through four metal detectors and lined up, single file, to enter a path enclosed by a narrow cage.<br/></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the end of the walkway was a tent with a golden idol at its entrance. Inside is the spot Hindus consider the birthplace of the god Ram.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Visitors bottlenecked to catch a glimpse. Women placed soggy bills into a donations box. And the pilgrims chanted, “Hail Lord Ram!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For decades, Hindus and Muslims have sparred over this speck of land in Ayodhya, India’s most disputed religious site, a few barren acres near the country’s northern farmlands.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Pak.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">China</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">NEpal</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">New Delhi</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">uttar</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">pradesh</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">Ayodhya</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">India</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">200 MILES</p><p class=\"g-pstyle7\">Ghaghara R.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle8\">9</p><p class=\"g-pstyle9\">Disputed temple</p><p class=\"g-pstyle10\">CHOWK AYODHYA RD.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle10\">AYODHYA-FAIZABAD RD.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle11\">Ayodhya</p><p class=\"g-pstyle12\">27</p><p class=\"g-pstyle12\">27</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">1 MILE</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, many Hindus are confident the land will remain in their hands.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A 16th-century mosque, the Babri Masjid, once stood here, a reminder of India’s history under Mughal rule. In 1992, Hindu activists <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/07/world/hindu-militants-destroy-mosque-setting-off-a-new-crisis-in-india.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">demolished the stone structure</a>, spurred by the belief that Ram, a widely revered deity, was born thousands of years ago on the same spot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Monthslong religious riots followed, killing around 2,000 people. The question of what to do dragged in India’s courts. Hindu litigants pushed to erect a temple. Muslims vowed to rebuild the mosque. India’s identity as an inclusive and secular nation hung in the balance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Judges feared more bloodshed if they hinted at partiality, though a de facto solution has persisted: Men who destroyed the mosque erected a makeshift tent that approximated a Hindu temple. It still stands, drawing thousands of visitors every day.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With the recent commanding <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/world/asia/narendra-modi-election-win.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">election victory</a> for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., many expect that the arrangement will be made permanent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ashok Baba Saheb Bhosle, 55, a sweat-slicked farmer plopped near the site’s exit, said a ruling from India’s Supreme Court, which could come this year, seemed a mere formality.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is 100 percent going to be a temple,” Mr. Bhosle said as a cheer went up among his friends, who had traveled hundreds of miles from central India to pray in Ayodhya. “Modi is in the temple!” he cried out. “It’s Modi’s house!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He may be right.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Modi’s party, with its ties to far-right groups that believe in Hindu supremacy, has doggedly supported building the temple. During a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/hope-ram-janmabhoomi-case-is-fast-tracked-says-amit-shah/articleshow/66743750.cms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">recent speech</a>, Amit Shah, India’s new home minister and a close adviser to Mr. Modi, promised pilgrims that his party would not budge “even by an inch” from its position. Some of the men who destroyed the mosque were members of the party.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Preparations to build the temple have already started. At a yard run by the Ram Birthplace Trust, an organization overseeing construction, men pounded chisels into slabs of stone, carving swirls of flowers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For years, the trust has readied pillars for the temple. Tour guides speaking half a dozen languages lead pilgrims with shaved heads, a mark of piety, around finished pillars inscribed with “Hail Lord Ram.” They claim that the pieces can be assembled in just 24 hours if the court gives permission.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Swami Ram Vilas Vedanti, a white-bearded leader of the trust and a former B.J.P. parliamentarian, said erecting the temple was about correcting a historical injustice. His group believes Mughal rulers tried to humiliate Hindus by taking over such a sacred spot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2010, a lower court <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/01/world/asia/01india.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">divided the disputed land</a> between Hindu and Muslim groups. Mr. Vedanti said a ruling like this one — which the Supreme Court stayed — was not acceptable to either side.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Eighty percent of Muslims believe we should construct a temple,” he said. “Only a few are resisting.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some Muslims in Ayodhya seemed fatalistic.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since Mr. Modi rose to power in 2014, the far right has never been more enfranchised to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/asia/modi-india-elections.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fkai-schultz&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">spread an us-versus-them mentality.</a> Such thinking has tried to make villains of India’s roughly 200 million Muslims and shrunk space for dissent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the last few years, governmental bodies have started rewriting textbooks, cutting sections on Muslim rulers and changing Muslim place names to Hindu ones.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Vigilante mobs have killed dozens of Muslims and lower-caste Indians suspected of slaughtering cows, a sacred animal in Hinduism. Activists found that most of the time <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/world/asia/india-cow-religious-attacks.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fkai-schultz&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=36&amp;pgtype=collection\" title=\"\">the attackers got away with their crimes</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Increasingly, hate crimes have also involved yelling Hindu slogans. In June, a Muslim man was tied to a poll in eastern India, beaten by a mob for hours and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/world/asia/india-hindu-muslim-beating.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Frod-nordland&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;pgtype=collection\" title=\"\">forced to shout “Hail Lord Ram.”</a> He later died of his injuries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In his tiny living room, Iqbal Ansari, a Muslim litigant whose family has publicly supported the mosque for decades, offered none of the cheery enthusiasm or grand predictions expressed by the temple’s supporters. He spoke numbly about the dispute, playing down reports of persecution and saying that whatever the court decides, “we will have to accept it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Zafaryab Jilani, a lawyer advising Mr. Ansari and other Muslim litigants, tried to stay upbeat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For now, he said, the court has kept a healthy and impartial distance from the political theater. Judges recently <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/india-supreme-court-orders-mediation-disputed-ayodhya-site-190308060623087.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">appointed mediators</a> to meet with lawyers, who have completed several rounds of talks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Jilani said that Muslims he met with privately were more incensed than they let on, and that the fight for a mosque was not one they could give up in good faith.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“A mosque does not belong to Muslims or any other human being,” he said. “It belongs to God almighty. No Muslim has the right to surrender it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But among the temple’s most vehement defenders, it was hard to find anybody willing to concede that a mosque had even existed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At a storeroom managed by the Ram Birthplace Trust, where a replica of the planned temple sits on a stage, Hazari Lal, a squat, jovial caretaker, said activists had simply torn down a “disputed structure.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was not a mosque,” he said. “Politicians gave it that name.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He brightened at this line of thought, and recounted his own role in the demolition.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In December 1992, Mr. Lal and other men wearing saffron headbands broke through a security cordon, screaming, “Atom bomb! Atom bomb!” and then climbing the building’s domed top. They slammed shovels, hammers and spears into the stone facade and toppled walls using ropes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rubble crushed Mr. Lal’s arm. Thousands more gathered, setting Muslim shops ablaze. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/07/world/hindu-militants-destroy-mosque-setting-off-a-new-crisis-in-india.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Foreign journalists were beaten.</a> Terrified families fled Ayodhya, where blood seeped into the city’s main river. Violence spread from India into neighboring countries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For his involvement, Mr. Lal spent several weeks in prison. Looking back, he said he had no regrets: A “long unfinished job” was finally coming to an end.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We people had no fear then, and no fear now,” he said, smiling and holding up his mangled arm. “Very soon you will see a temple here. Everything is ready.”</p>',\n",

       " 'india-water-crisis': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">CHENNAI, India — When the water’s gone, you bathe in what drips out of the air-conditioner. You no longer allow yourself the luxury of an evening shower at the end of a steamy summer’s day. You sprint down two flights of stairs with plastic pots as soon as a neighbor tells you the water tanker is coming.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Every day, 15,000 tankers ferry water from the countryside into the city. Everywhere you look, rows of bright neon plastic water pots are lined up along the lanes, waiting.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This is life in Chennai, a city of nearly five million on India’s southeastern coast. </p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">400 miles</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">CHINA</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">PAKISTAN</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">NEPAL</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">New Delhi</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">INDIA</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">Mumbai</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">Bay of Bengal</p><p class=\"g-pstyle7\">Chennai</p><p class=\"g-pstyle8\">Indian</p><p class=\"g-pstyle8\">Ocean</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">SRI LANKA</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rains from <!-- -->last year’s monsoon season were exceptionally weak<!-- -->. By the time summer came with its muggy, draining heat, the city’s four major water reservoirs had virtually run dry. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chennai has struggled with water for years. Either there’s not enough rain or there’s way too much rain, which floods in the streets before trickling out into the Bay of Bengal. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the problem is not just the caprice of nature. Gone are the many lakes and fields that once swallowed the rains. They have since been filled in and built over. Land is too expensive to be left fallow.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even groundwater is spent in many neighborhoods, over-extracted for years as a regular source of water, rather than replenished and stored as a backup. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And so now, little comes out of Bhanu Baskar’s taps at home, which is why she skips a shower on the days she doesn’t need to go out. She saves the water for her grown children, who both have office jobs and who both need a daily shower.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s very uncomfortable,” said Ms. Baskar, 48, trying to hide her shame. “It’s very tough.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s not hygienic, also,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chennai was primed for this crisis. The city gets most of its water each year from the short, heavy monsoon that begins in October and a few pre-monsoon showers. The trick is to capture what comes and save it for the lean times. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chennai requires every building to catch the rainwater from its rooftops and pour it back into the earth, but that has not been enough to stop either drought or flood. So the city spends huge amounts of money scooping water from the sea, churning it through expensive desalination plants and converting it into water that residents can use.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sekhar Raghavan, 72, a lifelong Chennai resident and the city’s most outspoken supporter of better rainwater harvesting, finds this absurd.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Some of us knew this crisis would come,” he said. “For us, in Chennai, harvesting means putting every drop of water back into the ground.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And then there’s climate change. It doesn’t bear direct blame for Chennai’s water crisis, but it makes it worse. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The city is hotter than before. Maximum temperatures have on average gone up by 1.3 degrees Celsius (or over 2 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1950, according to <!-- -->Roxy Mathew Koll<!-- -->, a climate scientist with the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. In an already hot tropical city — often above 90 degrees Fahrenheit and very humid in the summer — that means water evaporates faster and the demand for it rises.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The seeds of the crisis can be found in Velachery, a neighborhood named after one of Chennai’s many lakes. The lake was once deep and wide, but as the city grew, portions of it were filled in 20 years ago to make room for private homes. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">P. Jeevantham was one of the first residents in Velachery when it was developed. He built a slender, three-story apartment building, and manages a tiny shop selling everyday provisions on the ground floor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What remained of the lake was deep and clean back then. That didn’t last for long. Because the city’s water supply was erratic, Mr. Jeevantham drilled <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.indiawaterportal.org/topics/borewells-and-tubewells\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a bore well</a> to draw up water from the aquifer beneath Chennai. So did all his neighbors, up and down the block. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today, Mr. Jeevantham, 60, runs his motor seven hours a day to satisfy the needs of his own family of four and their tenants. It slurps water from 80 feet under the ground, slowly draining from the lake. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The lake is God’s gift,” he marveled. But for how much longer? This, he didn\\'t know. “Maybe five years,” he said, laughing uncomfortably. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Today the lake is a shallow, gray-green oasis, bordered on the edges by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/sep/27/hyacinth-invades-velachery-lake-again-1663270.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">invasive weeds</a> and trash, including, in one corner, a black and yellow, broken-down rickshaw.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Near the city center, the groundwater is nearly gone. <!-- -->Dev Anand, 30, <!-- -->still lives in his childhood home in the Anna Nagar area. For much of his life, his family relied on what city water came through the pipes. When that wasn’t enough, they drew water from under the ground. This summer, that dried up. For a few weeks, his neighbor shared his water. Then his groundwater dried up too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Anand, who is active with a civil society group that raises awareness about water, now relies on city tankers. He calls, complains, waits, worries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The entire <!-- -->neighborhood<!-- --> is on tenterhooks. No one knows when their bore wells will be exhausted. People are still drilling more wells all over the city, draining the aquifer further and faster. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Every now and then comes a sprinkling of pre-monsoon showers. Those, too, seem to leave the city no sooner than they enter it. The water reservoirs have been cleared of silt and trash. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The city says it dispatches more than 9,000 water tankers on any given day, more than ever before; private companies supply another 5,000 tankers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A steady stream of people line up at a public tap outside the city waterworks near Mr. Anand’s house. An auto-rickshaw driver said he came every afternoon with his wife and two children to fill up six big jugs. Men on scooters dangled their water pots on either side. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Everyone has their water-saving hacks. Rinse the rice, then use the water to wash the fish. Empty the dirty dishwater into the potted plants. Never, ever leave the tap running.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Forsake the washing machine, and hand wash everything with two carefully rationed buckets of water. To avoid a fight, fill only four pots when the water tanker arrives. Only once everyone has had their share should you consider going back for more.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And then there’s the air-conditioner. Everyone collects its drip. <!-- --> One day, when Rushyant Baskar woke up after working the night shift and turned on his water pump, a dry wheezing sound was all he heard. The buckets were empty, except the one under the air-conditioner. It was the only water he had.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“At that point, we thought we must get out of Chennai,” said Mr. Baskar, 28, who talks to clients in the United States at an outsourcing center. “It was devastating.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These days, his family increasingly relies on the generosity of neighbors. Someone orders a private water tank and shares. As soon as a city water tanker shows, neighbors text — and the Baskars rush out with their jugs. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is exhausting, all this waiting, worrying and keeping vigil for water. Mr. Baskar said he was sleeping less than usual. His mother said she hadn’t had time to check in with relatives on the other side of town. It used to be that you came to the big city to chase money, Mr. Baskar said. “Now we run after water.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Aruna Chandrasekhar contributed reporting from Chennai.</em></p>',\n",

       " 'iran-british-tanker': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">LONDON — A British warship forced three Iranian boats to back off after they sought to block a British tanker from passing through the Strait of Hormuz, the Defense Ministry said on Thursday, in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/world/europe/iran-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the latest escalation of tensions between Tehran and the West</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the Strait of Hormuz,” the British government said. “We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Iran denied any attempt to stop the tanker, according to Iranian news agencies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The dispute on Thursday is the latest complication in a three-way drama involving Iran, the United States and Europe that has played out since last year, when President Trump <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal</a> with Iran <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/06/us/politics/iran-sanctions-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">and restored sanctions</a> that had been suspended under the deal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many analysts and diplomats have warned that each small collision like the encounter with the tanker on Thursday may now increase the risk of a larger conflagration.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last week, British forces seized an <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/04/world/middleeast/oil-tanker-gibraltar-syria-iran.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar</a> bound for Syria, on suspicion that it was violating European Union sanctions, which Iran called an act of piracy. Some Iranian officials spoke of retribution, and an officer in Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Mohsen Rezaei, wrote on Twitter that if the tanker were not released, Iran “will be duty-bound to take reciprocal action and seize a British oil tanker.”</p><p class=\"css-1uuihdo\">Twenty percent of the global oil supply flows past Iran through the Strait of Hormuz.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Iranian President Hassan Rouhani derided Britain as recently as Wednesday for its decision to send its warships to escort commercial vessels through the Gulf. Calling Britain “scared” and “hopeless,” Mr. Rouhani warned that, “You, Britain, are the initiator of insecurity and you will realize the consequences later.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Britain and other European powers have sought to tamp down rising tensions between the United States and Iran, and salvage the nuclear pact. But Britain’s clashes with Iran could increase its own willingness to join the Trump administration in confronting Tehran, adding momentum to the conflict.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/world/middleeast/iran-rouhani-us-sanctions.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">The most recent escalation</a> began in May, after the Trump administration implemented comprehensive new sanctions intended to cut off all Iranian oil exports, as part of an effort to pressure Tehran into accepting sweeping new restrictions on its military activities and its nuclear program.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In May and June, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/21/world/middleeast/map-us-iran-drone-attack.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">six tankers were attacked</a> near the Strait of Hormuz, and Washington said Iranian forces planted naval mines to target some of the ships. The British government has said publicly Iran was “almost certainly” responsible for an attack last month on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Iran has denied responsibility.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/world/middleeast/iran-us-drone.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">The United States was on the verge of launching a missile strike</a> against Iran last month in retaliation for the shooting down of an American surveillance drone, but President Trump said he called off the military action at the last minute.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the tanker seizure near Gibraltar, Britain has said the ship was stopped because of European Union sanctions against Syria, not because of American sanctions against Iran. But Spanish and Iranian officials have said the British acted at Washington’s request.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In its statement on Thursday, the British government said three Iranian boats had attempted to stop the British Heritage in the early morning as it headed toward the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage out of the Persian Gulf that is a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/07/business/economy/iran-strait-of-hormuz-tankers.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">vital channel for international oil supplies</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A British warship, the Montrose, had been escorting the tanker in an effort to guard against any Iranian interference. After a short standoff, the British warned the three Iranian boats to back away and they did, the British government said in its statement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“H.M.S. Montrose was forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away,” the Defense Ministry said in a statement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Obviously very concerning developments,” Jeremy Hunt, Britain’s foreign secretary, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/SkyNews/status/1149315783027245057\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">told Sky News</a>, “but also I’m very proud of the Royal Navy and the role they played in keeping British assets, British shipping safe. We are continuing to monitor the situation very, very carefully.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Iran has long maintained that it does not seek a nuclear weapon. But the United States and some of its allies have been skeptical, citing evidence that Tehran was leaving that option open, and had hidden secret nuclear research that could move it closer to building a weapon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before the 2015 nuclear deal, the international powers had imposed economic sanctions intended to pressure Iran to accept restrictions on its nuclear program. Those sanctions were lifted when Iran agreed to dismantle much of its nuclear program under the deal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Trump administration later declared those restrictions inadequate and vowed to force Iran to submit to more severe limits on a much broader range of activities, including its support for allied militias around the region.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Britain and the European Union, which also signed the 2015 accord, still support the agreement and have urged Iran to comply with it, while pleading with the Trump administration to return to it. The European governments have also sought to set up an alternative trading system that would allow Iran to sidestep the latest American sanctions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the Trump administration has embarked on a campaign of “maximum pressure” that culminated in May with new sanctions seeking to cut off Iranian oil sales anywhere in the world, devastating the Iranian economy. Iranian officials called the penalties “economic warfare.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After adhering to its obligations under the 2015 deal for more than a year after the United States withdrew, Tehran responded to the American actions with carefully calibrated steps to revive its nuclear program beyond the limits imposed by the accord.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over the last two weeks, Iran has <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/us/politics/iran-nuclear-limit-compliance.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">exceeded the cap on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium</a> and also begun <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-limits-breach.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">enriching uranium to slightly higher levels</a> than had been allowed under the deal. Both moves could be easily reversed if Iran decides to return to full compliance with the agreement, but could be small steps toward building a nuclear weapon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Iran argues that its steps are authorized under the agreement because European governments have failed to deliver the promised sanctions relief. It says it will take additional steps in sixty-day intervals unless the Western governments provide economic relief.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Under the terms of the accord, Britain or the other European nations could seek to trigger so-called “snapback sanctions,” restoring the former economic penalties against Iran to punish it for exceeding the limits of the agreement. That would effectively extinguish hopes of reviving the deal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The United States and some of its allies have also accused Iran of retaliating against the sanctions by threatening the flow of oil through the vital Persian Gulf shipping lanes — a vulnerable passage with Iran on one side and its American-backed Arab rivals on the other.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The episode on Thursday will increase alarms in the West that Iran might seek to cut off the flow of oil through the Gulf.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The United States military has said it will begin working with partners to escort more tankers through the Gulf.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is hard to see an end game right now because it appears that the Trump administration is doubling down” but “the cost of that is going to be an increase in Iran’s escalatory reaction,” said Sanam Vakil, a researcher at Chatham House, in London. “It looks like we are going to be in simmering conflict for the near term.”</p>',\n",

       " 'italy-vatican-emanuela-orlandi': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">ROME — Thirty-six years ago, the teenage daughter of a Vatican City employee vanished off a Rome street on her way home, beginning one of Italy’s most enduring mysteries: Over the years, reports have variously linked her fate to the Sicilian Mafia, the K.G.B. and the plot to assassinate Pope John Paul II.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Thursday, the latest trail led her family and a Vatican-appointed forensic scientist to two tombs inside the Vatican walls, the burial places of princesses well over a century dead.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The team only found another mystery: The tombs were empty. Even the bodies of the dead princesses were missing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was yet another strange turn for a family that has suffered false leads, red herrings and intense media attention since the girl, Emanuela Orlandi, disappeared at age 15 on June 22, 1983. Their quest to discover her fate has taken them down many tortuous paths, following up on tips, anonymous letters and reports of sightings.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Like other well-scrutinized cold cases around the world, Emanuela’s disappearance has inspired many conspiracy theories. She has been linked to the C.I.A., as well as the K.G.B.; to Bulgarian agents and the 1981 <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/05/world/agca-says-he-altered-story-over-girl-s-abduction.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FOrlandi%2C%20Emanuela&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=4&amp;pgtype=collection\" title=\"\">plot to assassinate</a> Pope John Paul II; to the Mafia and a Roman crime gang; and to an American archbishop <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/world/europe/25italy.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FOrlandi%2C%20Emanuela&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;pgtype=collection\" title=\"\">involved in a major Italian banking scandal</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But clues in the case have been scanty, despite investigators’ efforts. This was not <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/world/europe/opening-of-crypt-revives-a-mystery.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FOrlandi%2C%20Emanuela&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=2&amp;pgtype=collection\" title=\"\">the first</a> exhumation in search of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/world/europe/emanuela-orlandi-bones-vatican-rome.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FOrlandi%2C%20Emanuela&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\" title=\"\">her remains</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The path to the tombs began in late 2017, when Emanuela’s brother, Pietro Orlandi, was approached by the first of several people working inside the Vatican who suggested that Emanuela might be buried in the Teutonic Cemetery, which for centuries was a final resting place for people of Germanic origin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His sources told him to seek the place where an angel was pointing in the cemetery, which is between St. Peter’s Basilica and the Paul VI Audience Hall.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That led Mr. Orlandi to the tomb of Princess Sophie of Hohenlohe, who died in 1836. Giovanni Arcudi, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, began the exhumation of the tomb on Thursday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Arcudi was authorized by the Vatican’s chief prosecutor to analyze the contents of the tomb — as well as the adjacent tomb of Princess Carlotta Frederica of Mecklenburg, who died in 1840 — and take samples for DNA testing. The theory was that Emanuela’s body was inside one of the tombs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Through the family’s lawyer, Laura Sgro, in February, Mr. Orlandi formally asked the Vatican to open the tomb of Princess Sophie. The family received approval last month to have open both tombs opened.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But any hope that the tombs would provide answers to the family were quickly dashed when the Vatican issued a statement hours after the operation began.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There were no human remains nor funerary urns,” the Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said in the statement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Princess Sophie von Hohenlohe’s tomb led to a large underground space that was “completely empty,” the statement said, while the tomb of Princess Carlotta Frederica of Mecklenburg “had no human remains.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Vatican added that the cemetery had undergone work during the first part of the 19th century, and again in the 1960s and 1970s, and that it would examine the documentation regarding these interventions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Thursday, Ms. Sgro said the family was trying to understand why they had been sent on yet another fruitless search.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We expected everything today, but not to find two empty tombs,” she said on the Italian affiliate of Sky News. “We want to know why we were sent there, and why there was nothing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After the tombs were found empty, Mr. Orlandi, Emanuela’s brother and the leader of the family’s decades-long efforts, told the Italian affiliate of Sky News, “Part of me was relieved that Emanuela was not there.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added in a separate interview on Thursday that his family had become used to “illusions and disillusions,” and that they had known that the exhumation could have been a further waste of time. “Still,” he said, “I was surprised that there was nothing at all.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Orlandi said he had called on the Vatican to investigate after receiving several tips from people working in the Vatican, though none of them were there at the time of his sister’s disappearance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said that he had been “positively surprised” by the Vatican’s assistance. “For the first time in 36 years, the Vatican has concretely done something important” in the case, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Opening the tomb “signals a change of position,” he said, noting that when he met Pope Francis in 2013, the pope told him that his sister was “in heaven” and left it at that.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Orlandi said the Vatican’s overture had been important, because after decades of denying any links with the case, there was “an admission that there is a possibility of internal responsibility.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But he said the missing princesses — even the sarcophagus in Princess Charlotte’s tomb was empty — posed a new dilemma for the Vatican. “Now, even the heirs don’t know where they’ve gone,” he said. “I think this is a problem for the Vatican that will have to be justified.”</p>',\n",

       " 'jeffrey-epstein-net-worth': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When federal prosecutors announced sex-trafficking charges against Jeffrey Epstein this week, they described him as “a man of nearly infinite means.” They argued that his vast wealth — and his two private jets — made him a flight risk.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein is routinely described as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-who-is-he.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a billionaire and brilliant financier</a>, and he rubbed elbows with the powerful, including former and future presidents. Even after <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/us/politics/acosta-epstein.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">his 2008 guilty plea in a prostitution case in Florida,</a> he promoted himself as a financial wizard who used arcane mathematical models, and he often dropped the names of Nobel Prize-winning friends. He told potential clients that they had to invest a minimum of $1 billion. At his peak in the early 2000s, a magazine profile said he employed 150 people, some working out of the historic Villard Houses on Madison Avenue.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Much of that appears to be an illusion, and there is little evidence that Mr. Epstein is a billionaire.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein’s wealth may have depended less on his math acumen than his connections to two men — Steven J. Hoffenberg, a onetime owner of The New York Post and a notorious fraudster later convicted of running <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/21/business/hoffenberg-confesses-to-ponzi-scheme.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a $460 million Ponzi scheme</a>, and Leslie H. Wexner, the billionaire founder of retail chains including The Limited and the chief executive of the company that owns Victoria’s Secret.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Hoffenberg was Mr. Epstein’s partner in two ill-fated takeover bids in the 1980s, including one of Pan American World Airways, and would later claim that Mr. Epstein had been part of the scheme that landed him in jail — although Mr. Epstein was never charged. With Mr. Wexner, Mr. Epstein formed a financial and personal bond that baffled longtime associates of the wealthy retail magnate, who was his only publicly disclosed investor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[President Trump was once a friend of Jeffrey Epstein. </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/trump-epstein.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Now he’s “not a fan.”</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein’s firm, Financial Trust Company, has released no audited financial statements or performance reports to back up his claims of investment prowess. In a 2002 court filing, Mr. Epstein said he had 20 employees, far fewer than reported figures around that time. Six years later, he lost large sums of money in the financial crisis. And friends and patrons — including Mr. Wexner — deserted him after he pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in 2008.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein, 66, is doubtless very rich: His real estate alone — <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-nyc-mansion.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">one of Manhattan’s largest private mansions,</a> a Palm Beach estate, a Paris apartment, his own Caribbean island and a huge New Mexico ranch — is worth more than $200 million. His investment firm reported having $88 million in capital from its shareholders in 2002.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He appears to have been doing business and trading currencies through Deutsche Bank until just a few months ago, according to two people familiar with his business activities. But as the possibility of federal charges loomed, the bank ended its client relationship with Mr. Epstein. It is not clear what the value of those accounts was at the time they were closed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A lawyer for Mr. Epstein, Reid Weingarten, did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein’s big break came when he was teaching math at the Dalton School, a prestigious Manhattan private school, in the mid-1970s. He had tutored the son of Alan Greenberg, the chairman of the mighty investment bank Bear Stearns, and ended up joining the firm.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He left after a few years. Mr. Epstein told Securities and Exchange Commission lawyers in an insider-trading investigation that there were three reasons, according to a 2003 Vanity Fair article. He had been disciplined over lending money to a friend to buy stock, and there were irregularities with his expense account and rumors he was having an affair with a secretary. (Mr. Epstein testified that he had known nothing about any insider trading, and neither he nor anyone else at the firm was charged.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 1981, he struck out on his own. He founded his own advisory firm, Intercontinental Assets Group, which he ran out of his apartment on East 66th Street. In 1987, he met Mr. Hoffenberg, then the chief executive of Towers Financial Corporation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Hoffenberg said in an interview that he had met Mr. Epstein in New York at the height of the 1980s takeover boom, when Ivan Boesky’s “Merger Mania” was a national best seller. Towers Financial was buying unpaid debt from hospitals, nursing homes and phone companies and trying to collect it — a distinctly unglamorous niche. Mr. Hoffenberg hired Mr. Epstein as a consultant for $25,000 a month, and the two men refashioned themselves as corporate raiders.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Two takeover efforts were spectacular failures. They made a run at Pan Am, and a news release issued by Towers in November 1987 listed their advisers as John Lehman, a former secretary of the Navy; John N. Mitchell, the attorney general during the Nixon administration; and Edward Nixon, former President Richard M. Nixon’s brother. But the bid collapsed after a jetliner exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, which sent Pan Am into bankruptcy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein and Mr. Hoffenberg also made a run at Emery Air Freight — an “epic failure,” according to an affidavit filed by Mr. Hoffenberg in a 2018 lawsuit against Mr. Epstein, which was brought by investors defrauded in Mr. Hoffenberg’s Ponzi scheme. The suit was dismissed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One takeover bid involving Mr. Epstein met with success: He told Vanity Fair in 2003 that he had invested $1 million, including $300,000 of his own money, in a raid on Pennwalt, a chemical processing firm in Philadelphia. Pennwalt eventually accepted an offer from a French company that was nearly double the price at which the investor group began acquiring shares, giving Mr. Epstein a profit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 1988, when Mr. Epstein was still working for Mr. Hoffenberg, he formed the investment firm that would be the nexus for his connections to powerful people: J. Epstein &amp; Company. One of those people, Mr. Wexner, would become the apparent foundation of Mr. Epstein’s riches.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein met — and evidently charmed — Robert Meister, the vice chairman of the insurance giant Aon, on a flight from New York to Palm Beach, Fla., according to an account by the novelist James Patterson in his nonfiction book “Filthy Rich.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Meister, who could not be reached for comment, introduced Mr. Epstein to Mr. Wexner. There appears to have been a near instant rapport.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Robert Morosky, who had been the vice chairman of The Limited, was surprised Mr. Wexner took to Mr. Epstein so readily. “Everyone was mystified as to what his appeal was,” Mr. Morosky said. “I checked around and found out he was a private high school math teacher, and that was all I could find out. There was just nothing there.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the time, Forbes estimated Mr. Wexner’s net worth at $1.8 billion, placing him 52nd on its billionaires list. Managing his money would be a lucrative business, but Mr. Epstein did more than that: A corporation controlled jointly by the two men bought a mansion on East 71st Street in Manhattan in 1989 for $13.2 million, at the time the highest price ever paid for a Manhattan townhouse, according to property records.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein was also closely involved with Mr. Wexner in a corporation that oversaw the transformation of New Albany, an Ohio suburb near The Limited’s Columbus headquarters, into a manicured, neo-Georgian utopia. In 1998, they appeared as co-presidents on the New Albany Corporation’s Ohio registration. Both men owned mansions in the community.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns,” Mr. Wexner told Vanity Fair in 2003. “But Jeffrey sees patterns in politics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By 1998 — the year he bought <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/business/01epstein.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Little St. James, a 70-acre island off St. Thomas</a> — Mr. Epstein had renamed his firm Financial Trust Company and moved it to the Virgin Islands. Mr. Epstein said he had told clients that he accepted only investments greater than $1 billion.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A corporate disclosure form from 2002 portrays a less impressive picture. Thomas Volscho, a sociology professor at the College of Staten Island who has been researching for a book on Mr. Epstein, recently obtained the form, which shows Financial Trust had $88 million in contributions from shareholders. In a court filing that year, Mr. Epstein said his firm had about 20 employees, far fewer than the 150 reported at the time by New York magazine.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There were clients other than Mr. Wexner. Mr. Epstein performed some services for the Johnson &amp; Johnson heiress Elizabeth Johnson, showing up as a co-trustee on 14 parcels of land owned in Dutchess County, N.Y. Most of the deeds were recorded in 1998, but Mr. Epstein resigned as a trustee for Ms. Johnson’s revocable trust at the end of that year, according to a document reviewed by The New York Times.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was also in 1998 that Mr. Epstein took sole possession of the 71st Street mansion. Mr. Wexner conveyed his interest in the corporation that owned it to one controlled by Mr. Epstein for $20 million, according to a person familiar with the transaction.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By 2003, Mr. Epstein had the means to pledge $30 million to Harvard University to fund a program in evolutionary dynamics, seeded with a $6.5 million gift.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the financial crisis cost Mr. Epstein some of his fortune, and allegations of sexual abuse with teenage girls cost him some of his friends.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bear Stearns — the bank that had given Mr. Epstein his start — was still among his investments when the crisis hit. According to a lawsuit he later filed against the bank, Mr. Epstein controlled about 176,000 shares of Bear Stearns, worth nearly $18 million, in August 2007.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein sold 56,000 shares at $101 each that month. He sold the remaining 120,000 shares in March 2008 as the firm was collapsing — 20,000 at $35 and the rest at $3.04, losing big. He also lost about $50 million in one of Bear’s hedge funds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the time Bear Stearns came apart, Mr. Epstein was at the center of his first abuse case. He pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in 2008, receiving a jail sentence that allowed him to work at home during the day but also required him to register as a sex offender.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A spokeswoman for Mr. Wexner said he “severed ties” with Mr. Epstein 12 years ago. But not everyone immediately abandoned Mr. Epstein after he was charged in 2006.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein was an investor in Environmental Solutions Worldwide, a maker of emission-control products, in 2011 with several people close to Leon Black, the billionaire founder of the private equity firm Apollo Management, including Mr. Black’s four children. It was for that company that Mr. Epstein’s company filed its lone S.E.C. disclosure form.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The company’s current shareholders are not publicly available; it no longer trades on a registered exchange, and does not have to make public filings.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Epstein was also listed as a director of the Debra and Leon Black Family Foundation until 2012, although the foundation said he had resigned in 2007. “The inaccuracy was discovered and corrected,” the foundation said in a statement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In recent years, Mr. Epstein was a client of Deutsche Bank’s private-banking division, which caters to ultrawealthy individuals and families. The bank provided Mr. Epstein with loans and wealth-management accounts, as well as trading services through its investment banking arm, according to two people familiar with the relationship. At one point, compliance officers at Deutsche Bank raised concerns about transactions by Mr. Epstein’s company, because he posed reputational risk to the bank, the people said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Deutsche Bank managers overruled their concerns, the people said. They noted that there was nothing illegal about the transactions and that Mr. Epstein was a lucrative client.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Earlier this year, the bank ended its relationship with Mr. Epstein.</p>',\n",

       " 'jim-bouton-dead-ball-four': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jim Bouton, a pitcher of modest achievement but a celebrated iconoclast who left a lasting mark on baseball as the author of “Ball Four,” a raunchy, shrewd, irreverent — and best-selling — player’s diary that tainted the game’s wholesome image, died on Wednesday at his home in the Berkshires in Massachusetts. He was 80.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His wife, Paula Kurman (who declined to identify his town of residence), said he died after a long <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/sports/baseball/jim-bouton-brain-disease.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">struggle with vascular dementia</a>. Bouton had a stroke in 2012, and in 2017 revealed that he had cerebral amyloid angiopathy, a brain disease.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Ball Four,” published in 1970, reported on the selfishness, dopiness, childishness and meanspiritedness of young men often lionized for playing a boy’s game very well, and many readers saw it, approvingly or not, as a scandalous betrayal of the baseball clubhouse.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the book, which was Bouton’s account of the 1969 baseball season, seven years after his big-league debut with the Yankees, had a larger narrative — namely, his attempt at age 30 to salvage a once-promising career by developing the game’s most peculiar and least predictable pitch: the knuckleball.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The pitch, which is optimally delivered with no spin, requires finesse, fingertip strength and a good deal of luck; without spin, the ball is subject to the air currents on the way to the plate, causing it to move erratically, making it difficult for the hitter —not to mention the catcher and the umpire — to track, and just as difficult for the pitcher to control.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the book, the pitch is a metaphor for Bouton’s view of himself as an eccentric member of a baseball society of conservative go-alongs, stubbornly following his own path and yet dependent on the whimsy of outside forces.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the 1969 season, Bouton played for an American League expansion team, the Seattle Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers), who demoted him for a time to the minor-league affiliate in Vancouver, British Columbia, and eventually traded him to the Houston Astros in the National League.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The book, originally published with the subtitle “My Life and Hard Times Throwing the Knuckleball in the Major Leagues,” chronicled the insecurities of an athlete, a one-time star, approaching the end of the line.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Not only did I have some tenderness in my elbow today, but Sal told me I’ll be pitching in the exhibition game Sunday,” Bouton wrote early in spring training, referring to the Seattle pitching coach Sal Maglie. “The tenderness will go away, but how am I going to pitch on Sunday? I’m not ready. I haven’t pitched to spots yet. I haven’t thrown any curveballs at all. My fingers aren’t strong enough to throw the knuckleball right. I’ve gone back to taking two baseballs and squeezing them in my hand to try to strengthen my fingers and increase the grip.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some reviewers recognized the poignant tension in Bouton’s tale; in The New Yorker, for instance, Roger Angell described “Ball Four” as “a rare view of a highly complex public profession seen from the innermost inside, along with an even more rewarding inside view of an ironic and courageous mind.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added, “And, very likely, the funniest book of the year.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But for most readers, Bouton’s personal predicament was overwhelmed by what he revealed about life in the major leagues.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In his telling, players routinely cheated on their wives on road trips, devised intricate plans to peek under women’s skirts or spy on them through hotel windows, spoke in casual vulgarities, drank to excess and swallowed amphetamines as if they were M&amp;Ms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mickey Mantle played hung over and was cruel to children seeking his autograph, he wrote. Carl Yastrzemski was a loafer. Whitey Ford illicitly scuffed or muddied the baseball, and his catcher, Elston Howard, helped him do it. Most coaches were knotheads who dispensed the obvious as wisdom when they weren’t contradicting themselves, and general managers were astonishingly penurious and dishonest in dealing with players over their contracts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the time, the reserve clause, a part of every contract that bound players nearly irrevocably to their teams, was still in effect; free agency, which multiplied the earning power of players by many orders of magnitude, was still in the future. Bouton signed a contract with Seattle for $22,000, and his account of the annual petty wrangling over three- and four-figure sums, discomforting at the time, seems incredible today, when the major league minimum salary is $555,000 and players are earning an average of more than $4 million a year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over all, Bouton portrayed the game — its players, coaches, executives and most of the reporters who covered them — as a world of amusing, foible-ridden, puerile conformity. Not surprising, the baseball establishment frowned on Bouton, his collaborating editor, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/20/archives/leonard-shecter-sportswriter-ball-four-co-author-is-dead-like-a.html?module=inline\" title=\"Times obituary \">Leonard Shecter</a>, and the book.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The commissioner at the time, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/sports/baseball/16kuhn.html?module=inline\" title=\"Times obituary \">Bowie Kuhn</a>, called Bouton in for a reprimand; some players shunned him for spilling the beans to players’ wives about what players did on road trips. (Bouton himself was no exception; his first wife, Bobbie Bouton, teamed up with another baseball wife, Nancy Marshall, to wrote their own tell-all, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/07/sports/painful-memories.html?module=inline\" title=\"Times review\">“Home Games</a>,” after she and Bouton divorced.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A few players, including Elston Howard, said Bouton was a liar. And many of an older sportswriting generation felt Bouton had done irreparable damage to the game out of his own desperation and sense of self-importance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I feel sorry for Jim Bouton,” Dick Young wrote in The Daily News. “He is a social leper. His collaborator on the book, Leonard Shecter, is a social leper. People like this, embittered people, sit down in their time of deepest rejection and write. They write, oh hell, everybody stinks, everybody but me, and it makes them feel much better.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a follow-up book, “I’m Glad You Didn’t Take It Personally,” which was largely about the reaction to “Ball Four,” Bouton thanked Young and Kuhn for their part in stirring the controversy that made the book a success.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And a success it was, even though Bouton wasn’t the first athlete to publish an insider’s account of the professional sporting life; “Instant Replay,” a personal chronicle of the 1967 National Football League season by the Green Bay Packers guard Jerry Kramer, had preceded it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bouton wasn’t even the first baseball player to keep and publish a diary; Jim Brosnan, who pitched for four major league teams, published “The Long Season” in 1960.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, not only was “Ball Four” an instant and enduring best seller;, it also earned widespread recognition as a seminal text of sports literature. In 2002, Sports Illustrated placed it at No. 3 on its list of the top 100 sports books of all time. Perhaps more notable, in 1995, as the New York Public Library celebrated its centennial, it included “Ball Four” as the only sports book among 159 titles in its exhibit “Books of the Century.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">James Alan Bouton was born in Newark on March 8, 1939, to George and Trudy (Vischer) Bouton. His father was a business executive who was selling pressure cookers at the time. The family lived in New Jersey suburbs, Rochelle Park and Ridgewood, until Jim was in his teens and his father took a job in Chicago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jim played American Legion ball — he threw a knuckleball from time to time even then — and graduated from Bloom High School in Chicago Heights, Ill. He spent a year at Western Michigan University before he was signed by the Yankees in December 1958. He made it to the big leagues in 1962.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was “Ball Four” that established Bouton’s public reputation as a flouter of baseball decorum, but he was an odd duck within the game from the beginning. His career had a strange arc. As a Yankee in the early 1960s, he enjoyed brief stardom as a hard-throwing right-hander, with a fastball and curveball that he delivered straight overhand, a violent motion that caused him frequently to lose his hat, an idiosyncrasy that became a trademark.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Even as a young player, he had a pugnacious wit and a willingness to speak his liberal mind, most notably to reporters, whom other Yankees made a habit of disdaining. His talking freely on subjects like the war in Vietnam, student protests on campus and the civil rights movement raised that hackles of teammates and team executives alike.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“After two or three years of playing with guys like Mantle and Maris,” Bouton recalled in “I’m Glad You Didn’t Take It Personally,” “I was no longer awed. I started to look at those guys as people and I didn’t like what I saw. They were fine as baseball heroes. As men they were not quite so successful. At the same time I guess I started to rub a lot of people the wrong way. Instead of being a funny rookie, I was a veteran wiseguy. I reached the point where I would argue to support my opinion and that didn’t go down too well either.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, the first three seasons he pitched for the Yankees were pennant winners, completing a streak of five American League titles in a row.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 1963 he went 21-7, pitched a scoreless inning in the All-Star Game and in the World Series lost a 1-0 decision to Don Drysdale and the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 3 of the Dodgers’ sweep. In 1964, he was 18-13 and won two games against the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, though the Yankees lost that Series, too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those were the glory days. Arm trouble bit him after that; he was 4-15 in 1965 as the Yankees slipped to sixth place, and by 1968 he was expendable: The Yankees sold him to the Seattle Angels, then a minor league team, which became a major league expansion team, the Pilots, the next year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In addition to his wife, Bouton is survived by two sons, Michael and David (who was adopted from Korea as a boy and was called Kyong Jo at the start of “Ball Four”); two stepchildren; and six grandchildren. A daughter, Laurie, was killed in a car crash in 1997.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The notoriety earned by “Ball Four” propelled Bouton to several other episodes in the public eye. For a time he was a sportscaster for network affiliates in New York. He was a delegate from New Jersey for Senator George S. McGovern at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. He appeared as a crafty killer who gets his comeuppance in Robert Altman’s 1973 sardonic crime drama, “The Long Goodbye,” an updating of the Raymond Chandler novel. And he appeared in a short-lived television series based on “Ball Four” — it lasted just five episodes in 1976.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With Eliot Asinof, best known as the author of “Eight Men Out,” an account of the Black Sox scandal of 1919, Bouton wrote “Strike Zone” (1994), a plot-heavy and melodramatic novel about an umpire on the horns of a moral dilemma: He must decide whether to affect the outcome of a game in order to help a man who once saved his life and is now in trouble with gangsters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bouton also wrote a book, “Foul Ball” (2005), about his quixotic effort to save an old ballpark in Pittsfield, Mass. That inspired him to help form and promote the Vintage Base Ball Federation, which organizes games played according to 19th-century rules by baseball-fan versions of Civil War re-enactors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Ball Four” was published during the 1970 season while Bouton was with the Astros, but he was having a poor year, and after being demoted to the minors, he retired.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Bouton wasn’t kidding in “Ball Four” when he wrote that it had been miserable being unable to scratch the competitive itch. So he played semipro ball for several years, and, attempting an unlikely comeback, persevered though stints with minor league teams in Durango, Mexico; Knoxville, Tenn.; Savannah, Ga.; and Portland, Ore., where he became the first investor in Big League Chew, shredded bubble gum in a pouch, invented by a bullpen-mate, Rob Nelson, in emulation of chewing tobacco.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Finally, in September 1978, Ted Turner, then the owner of a then-hapless team, the Atlanta Braves, brought Bouton to his big-league roster, where, at the age of 39, eight years after his first retirement, he started five games and actually won one (he lost three others), pitching six innings and giving up no earned runs against the San Francisco Giants.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He finished his career with a record of 62-63 and a creditable cumulative earned run average of 3.57. By then he had also proved the validity of the final line of “Ball Four,” perhaps the best-known and most resonant sentence in the book, an explanation of why he would put up with the frustration and lunacy he had written about, and a pithy encapsulation of the tug of sport on an athlete.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You see,” he wrote, “you spend a good deal of your life gripping a baseball, and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.”</p>',\n",

       " 'kosciusko-belarus-memorial': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">KOSAVA, Belarus — Thomas Jefferson hailed him as the “purest son of liberty I have ever known.” New York named a bridge, a street and swimming pool after him to celebrate his role in the American War of Independence. Poland reveres him as the leader of a late-18th-century revolt against the Russian empire.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So what is Andrej Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a lifelong foe of autocracy, doing at the center of a state-run memorial complex in Belarus — a close ally of Russia that has been ruled for 25 years by the same autocratic leader?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The simple answer is that Kosciuszko — known in Belarus as Kastiushka — was born and raised in the bucolic countryside around Kosava, a small Belarusian town 125 miles southwest of the capital, Minsk.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Tired of being dismissed as an appendage of Russia, denounced as “Europe’s last dictatorship” or, worse still, simply ignored, Belarus is now exalting its most famous local hero.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He is an American national hero and a Polish national hero, but he is our hero, too,” said Irina Semenyuk, the deputy director of the memorial complex. “Thanks to him, people know about us.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That may be overstating things a bit, particularly his status in contemporary America. But Kosciuszko (pronounced “kosh-CHUSH-ko,” not as New Yorkers would have it) was far ahead of most of his European contemporaries in fighting for democracy and human rights.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After architecture and art studies in Poland and France, he traveled to America in 1776, fleeing a doomed love. In Philadelphia, he helped design fortifications to protect the Continental Congress and joined forces fighting the British along the Hudson River.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He then spent two years fortifying West Point, where he was made chief of engineering in 1780. He ended the War of Independence as a brigadier general in the United States Army and a citizen of the new republic.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Back in Europe in the 1780s, he supported liberal reforms in what was then the western fringe of an expanding Russian empire. In 1794, he led an uprising against Russian rule and achieved his greatest military success by defending Warsaw against besieging Russian and Prussian forces for months.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His opposition to serfdom, however, made some, especially nobles, wary of supporting him and the revolt was finally defeated.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jailed for a time in St. Petersburg at Peter Paul Fortress, Kosciuszko was released after the death of Catherine the Great in 1796, and allowed to leave Russia.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">200 miles</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">Estonia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">Russia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">Latvia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">Lithuania</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">Minsk</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">Kosava</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">Belarus</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">Poland</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">ukraine</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The original wooden house where Kosciuszko was born in 1746 burned down in 1944 when Soviet guerrilla fighters, in pursuit of retreating Nazi soldiers, set fire to a nearby palace that had been used by the Germans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the time of Kosciuszko’s birth, this land belonged not to Belarus — which first came into existence in 1918 — but to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which at its height controlled territory from the Baltics to the Black Sea.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many other towns in what is now Belarus have their own claims to fame, like Mir, the birthplace of Louis B. Mayer, the film producer and co-founder of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer or Novahrudak, the ancestral home of President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But none can beat Kosava for the global celebrity of its own native son, after whom Australia named one of its highest peaks and who stands atop a pedestal at the United States Military Academy at West Point.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Poland, nearly every town has a street or square commemorating his struggle against tyranny, particularly the Russian variety. France named him an honorary citizen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ruled from Moscow as part of the Soviet Union until 1991, Belarus for decades showed no interest in celebrating Kosciuszko.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Soviet rulers never liked him much and removed an early statue put up in his honor by Poles in western Belarus. For years, the only statue in his honor was a bust on the grounds of the American Embassy in Minsk.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The post-Soviet Belarus state, too, initially kept him at arm’s length, said Leonid Nesterchuk, a Belarus historian who heads the Kosciuszko Foundation, which has been lobbying since the 1990s for official recognition of Kosciuszko as a Belarus hero.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In recent years, however, the authorities, prodded by Kosciuszko fans, have started viewing him as a useful source of national pride. He entered school textbooks as a local-born giant on the world stage and got a new street named in his honor in Brest, near the border with Poland.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Nesterchuk said that when he first appealed to the government for money to reconstruct Kosciuszko’s house in the 1990s, he was rebuffed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But, despite testy relations between Minsk and Washington, it did not object when the State Department in 2004 gave his foundation $28,000 to build a wooden house on the original stone foundations. The United States last year gave an additional $12,000 for repairs to the thatched roof.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Also last year, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://belsat.eu/en/news/monument-of-tadeusz-kosciuszko-opened-in-belarus-photo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a statue of Kosciuszko,</a> the country’s first such public tribute, was put up outside the replica of the house. The cost of the statue, around $12,000, was raised through a crowdfunding campaign.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A plaque on its base declares the world-renowned champion of freedom “a great son of Belarus land.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The authorities in Minsk pay for the upkeep of Kosciuszko’s birthplace and the salaries of guides. They are also funding the lavish renovation of the nearby palace, a jewel of neo-Gothic architecture, and plan to turn the whole area into a national historical site.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The mayor of Kosava, Leonid Yuditz, a loyal acolyte of Belarus’s authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, said he saw no problem in celebrating an 18th-century champion of democracy, so long as this helps puts his town and country on the map.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Because of him people now come here and leave their money,” he said, noting that foreign tourists, particularly Kosciuszko enthusiasts from neighboring Poland, have been pouring into town and seen what Belarus has to offer — pristine nature, clean air and unusually tidy streets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The mayor, like all officials in Belarus, is particularly proud of his country’s cleanliness, a stark contrast with the filth and disarray that blights many towns and villages in neighboring Russia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More than 35,000 people last year visited the Belarus shrine to the memory of the man who helped George Washington beat the British and then returned home to rally a potent, but ultimately unsuccessful, uprising against the Russian czarina.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Belarus’s belated enthusiasm for Kosciuszko has irked some people in neighboring Poland, which views him as a Polish national treasure.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Belarus did not even exist when he was born,” said Veslav Wychodzki, a retiree from Poland who traveled to Kosava recently to pay tribute to Kosciuszko. “This was Polish land. They only put up a statue to him last year and never really talked about him before.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Nesterchuk, the Belarus historian, said: “The Poles say he belongs to them. The Lithuanians, the Ukrainians say the same thing. The Americans, too.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“But I always say that Kosciuszko does not belong to anyone,” Mr. Nesterchuk added. “He belongs to the whole world as a true democrat and a fighter for freedom.”</p>',\n",

       " 'liz-cambage-aces-las-vegas': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Liz Cambage had gathered her friends for a going-away party in Australia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There was only one problem: The W.N.B.A. superstar didn’t know if she was actually leaving. At the time, in early May, Cambage’s rights still belonged to the Dallas Wings, a team she’d said she would no longer play for. But with training camp underway, the Wings hadn’t completed a deal to send Cambage elsewhere.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I literally went into my going-away dinner like, I could still be here next week,” Cambage said. “If I am, cool, but let’s just act like I’m leaving.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The day after the dinner, the Wings completed a trade with the Las Vegas Aces that changed the balance of power in the league. Cambage, 27, arrived in Las Vegas 48 hours later as a member of the W.N.B.A.’s newest championship contender. But she was wary: She had clashed with Aces Coach Bill Laimbeer last season. (She said she cursed at him as she shot a free throw.) And after working hard to give up alcohol and live a healthier, less party-centric life, she worried about moving to so-called Sin City.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I still think the reason I did hurt my Achilles’ before the world championships,” Cambage said, referring to her ruptured Achilles’ tendon before the 2014 tournament, “is because I was drinking so much, and partying so much, and I wasn’t sleeping enough. I had a whole lot of life dramas going on. I was just using alcohol as an escape. But I’ve learned from it, and I know that it won’t suck me in.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Her professional life dates to the 2011 W.N.B.A. draft, which sent her to the Tulsa Shock as a 19-year-old trying to navigate a new country and career. But, she said, it has been a career of improper fits, even as a 6-foot-8 center who has presented impossible matchup problems for any opponent. She noted that flying from Melbourne, where she is from, to Tulsa, required a connecting flight in Oklahoma City. A trip to Dallas, where the Shock moved while retaining her rights, also required multiple plane changes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rumors swirled in the off-season that she wanted to be traded to the Los Angeles Sparks for a simple reason: There’s a direct flight there from Melbourne, easing the burden for family and friends to visit her.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I don’t want my family traveling 30 hours to come see me,” Cambage said, adding that her grandmother, who is ill, would not be up to the task.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s all a lot for someone who never planned to become a basketball player. Cambage’s mother, Julia Cambage, is a dancer-turned-architect and now chief executive of the Australian Institute of Architects. Cambage grew up playing piano and violin, and planned to study design and architecture, only to turn to basketball when she reached 6 feet tall at age 10, and 6-foot-5 by age 14.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Watching Cambage effortlessly grab rebounds or sink shots from anywhere on the court now, it’s hard to imagine her anywhere else — but she has never seen herself foremost as a basketball player.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Unlike many of her peers, whose lives revolve around basketball, Cambage has walked away from the game before, and plans to do so again, this time after the 2020 W.N.B.A. season. She spoke of taking a trip to the Amazon, indulging her interest in design and giving herself over to her time as a D.J. (She is scheduled to be the D.J. at a party featuring Snoop Dogg during All-Star weekend in Las Vegas later this month.) That time, she said, drains all the stress from her body that comes with fighting on-court opponents who try to stop her using any physical means necessary.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Right now I’m just paving the way to the Tokyo Olympics” in 2020, Cambage said. “And I’m giving this career everything I can for the next two years, and then I will be stepping away and re-evaluating everything.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Everything she has may be enough to lift the Aces to a championship in just their second year after moving from San Antonio. Cambage had Skylar Diggins-Smith and mostly role players alongside her on the Dallas Wings, but now she’s playing on a starting five that is the envy of the league. Cambage is the center; A’ja Wilson, the 2018 rookie of the year, plays power forward; Kayla McBride, a two-time All-Star, is at small forward; Kelsey Plum, the 2017 No. 1 overall draft pick 2017, is the shooting guard; and this year’s No. 1 draft pick, Jackie Young, is handling point guard duties.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Our starting five is ridiculous,” Cambage said. “Our bench is great as well. And it’s just a hardworking team and just a bunch of women that just want to work hard and win, and do whatever it takes. We’re young, and I find myself growing into the leadership role here a bit. Especially on court.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That takes its form in several ways. There’s the statistical side, where Cambage, always a gifted passer, is finding her teammates at an elevated clip — <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/players/c/cambael01w.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a 17.9 assist percentage</a>. Opposing teams quickly discovered that double-teaming Cambage was not a recipe for success with so many other scorers alongside her on the court.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Accordingly, the Aces are <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://stats.wnba.com/team/1611661319/onoffcourt-summary/?sort=DIFF_NET_RATING&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2019&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">19.1 points per 100 possessions better</a> with Cambage on the floor than with her off it. Not that this level of play is anything new. Cambage made the All-Star team in 2011 at 19 years old; and through her first 98 games in the W.N.B.A., <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/wnba_psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;type=totals&amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;qual=mp_per_g_req&amp;c1stat_r=g&amp;c1comp_r=gt&amp;c1val_r=50&amp;order_by_r=per&amp;order_by_p=pts\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">her player efficiency rating of 27.4 ranks fourth</a> in league history, behind only Cynthia Cooper, Elena Delle Donne and Lauren Jackson.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Aces were 9-5 entering Wednesday’s game against the Indiana Fever, first in the Western Conference and third in the W.N.B.A., behind Cambage and Wilson, who are neck-and-neck for top ranking on the team in rebounds, assists and blocks per game. This level of performance has the Aces trending for what Cambage told her friends in Australia would have her busy through September: the W.N.B.A. finals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Cambage told friends that she planned to see them again in October. It’s part of her new plan to speak things into existence, something she said she picked up from religiously listening to Oprah’s SuperSoul Sessions podcasts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Julia Cambage is also planning to fly to Las Vegas for the finals. Business took her to town to speak at a conference earlier this season, something Liz Cambage wryly added didn’t happen in her Tulsa days. Cambage’s contract runs through 2019, but she said she planned to re-sign for 2020. She has begun looking at real estate in the city.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was so scared of living in Vegas, but it’s so chill. It’s so dope,” Cambage said, adding: “I go out and have delicious meals, and I’ve been to a couple of shows already. Took my mom to Celine Dion. I’m having a very wholesome and humble time living in Vegas so far, and it’s going to stay that way.”</p>',\n",

       " 'matt-zurbo-cielo': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">EAGLEHAWK NECK, Tasmania — By the time Matt Zurbo plopped on the couch to write his 282nd children’s book, he’d worked all day at an oyster farm, laughed with his daughter on the beach, gone for a swim in the frigid waves and cooked a vegetarian feast.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was just after 10 p.m., and his eyes were drooping. But not for long. Assisted by <!-- -->whiskey<!-- --> and a Venezuelan ballad, he finished <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://cielo365stories.com/2019/05/22/day-282-dance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the tale of a girl who loved to dance</a> and published it online at 1 a.m., leaving just 83 stories to go before completing his 365-day challenge.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The more kids love stories and love books, the better the world will be for my daughter,” Zurbo said. “Imagination trumps violence and ignorance, and always will.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many of us who are parents experience a similar flush of love for stories with the arrival of our firstborn. Some people (<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.today.com/parents/hoda-kotb-celebrates-release-new-children-s-book-you-are-t149778\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Hoda Kotb</a>, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.parents.com/baby/all-about-babies/kelly-clarkson-wrote-a-picture-book-about-her-daughter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Kelly Clarkson</a>) even produce books inspired by their offspring. But Zurbo’s challenge, named after his 20-month-old daughter, Cielo, is a case study in creativity. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He’s not just a writer with four published novels, an oral history of Australian-rules football and eight children’s books. He’s also a hard-living adventurer with hands he can’t close into fists after 30 years clearing trails and replanting forests in the Australian bush.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Oystering at sunrise is his form of settling down. As for marriage and fatherhood? “Never expected it,” Zurbo told me. “I was waiting around to die.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His book project, then, is best read as a burst of daily celebration — what might happen if an Australian Jack Kerouac had the child he’d always wanted, at age 50, with a Venezuelan architect who showed up at a logger’s pub one night. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Zurbo’s stories range from the joyous (<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://cielo365stories.com/2019/01/29/day-167-bare-feet/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Day 168: “Bare Feet”</a>) to the absurd (<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://cielo365stories.com/2019/01/05/backwards-billy-with-hanging/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Day 144: “Backwards With Billy Hanging”</a>) to the lyrical (<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://cielo365stories.com/2018/08/21/day-7-the-worlds-smallest-sound/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Day 7: “The World’s Smallest Sound”</a>) and the personal (<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://cielo365stories.com/2018/12/25/day-133-for-cielo/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Day 133: “For Cielo”</a>). None of them have been published, nor is there any marketing behind the project. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That’s what’s so beautiful about it,” said Matt Ottley, who has illustrated award-winning children’s books such as “Luke’s Way of Looking.” “It’s generally just floating there in the net. It’s like coming across a really rich secret garden that nobody knew existed.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[Want Australia stories in your inbox?

He is 52 but looks younger, with the slightly hunched walk of an athlete perpetually leaning forward. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When we arrived at his wood-slat home, a neighbor’s chickens running free in the yard, he carried his Macbook in one hand and oyster-stained pants in the other. Inside, he eyed the shiny sea-blue linoleum, the orderly kid\\'s room, and apologized for the lack of a lived-in vibe. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s not normally like this,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Leaning against the kitchen table was a black-and-white photo of a crowded pub. His sister, a music photographer who goes by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://zodamage.com/galleries\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Zo Damage</a>, shot it at the Tote, a Melbourne venue for raucous bands ignored by pop charts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a beautiful mess,” Zurbo said. “A place where people who believe in things go.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His first novel, “Idiot Pride,” published by Penguin in 1997, was born in grotty places like that. Written for young adults but full of sex, marijuana and alienation, it was shortlisted as book of the year by the Children’s Book Council of Australia. “It was about trying to find pride in going nowhere — idiot pride,” Zurbo said as he chopped a sweet potato for dinner.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The front door creaked open. Cielo burst in with a squeal and Zurbo spun her around while singing “Cecilia.” Over vegetables and rice, while Cielo played with a book, Zurbo and his wife, Elena, explained their unexpected domesticity. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They met three years ago, when he was on a break from the forest and she was on vacation after splitting with her husband. Having fled Caracas and an architecture job where she was pressured to support the government, Elena, 38, was trying out interior design and working on a novel. He was frustrated with his last book and had given up on love.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was in the mountains just living a hard life,” he said. “Everyone said this is going to change everything, and I said, ‘Thank Christ.’”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Their daughter arrived after a scary trip down Tasmania’s country roads, Elena having gone into labor three weeks early with <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://parenting.nytimes.com/pregnancy/preeclampsia-symptoms\" title=\"\">pre-eclampsia</a>. They got engaged that night. A golden-haired extrovert, Cielo (“heaven” in Spanish) is their surprise beginning.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[ </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://parenting.nytimes.com/join\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">The topics new parents are talking about.

Ultimately, he said, he’s trying to be a good parent, building on what his father, an illustrator, and mother, a doyenne of Melbourne’s avant-garde theater <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/how-the-pram-factory-shaped-australian-theatre/8714140\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the Pram Factory</a>, did for him: inspire a love of creativity. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My mum and dad split up when I was 2. So what?” he said. “Mostly, they cut me loose, which was great for my imagination. I was free to roam.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His own urges, Zurbo admitted, still push in the same direction. With everything, he seems to work fast, as if wasted time and energy are evil. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Four hours after publishing the story about the dancing girl, he was in the kitchen mixing dinner’s leftovers with eggs to carry to work for lunch. By sunrise, we were out on Boomers Bay and he was in the muddy shallows, guiding a boat alongside a Pacific gull he’d named Sphincter.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Oystering is mostly lugging baskets from one place to another. Zurbo admitted he didn’t love it as much as the forest, and he worried that the wages of around 23 Australian dollars an hour ($16) were not enough for a family, but he attacked every task.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“As a worker, he’s great,” said Phil Glover, his manager at Blue Lagoon Oysters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Stories, even at work, seemed to rise like tides. At one point, Zurbo told me he had an idea for one inspired by the previous day’s tale of the dancing girl.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“She’s dancing with a monster no one can see,” he said. “And her brother, he doesn’t know it, but he’s making the monster laugh.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some of the stories in “Cielo” come from these kinds of iterations. But a lot of them start with people he’s met and what they tell him about their children.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://cielo365stories.com/2018/11/24/day-102-the-best-skier-in-the-world/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Day 102: “The Best Skier in the World”</a> is drawn from a friend whose son broke his leg skiing and needed cheering up. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://cielo365stories.com/2019/03/10/day-209-austins-first-game/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Day 209: “Austin’s First Game”</a> is for Dave “Wally” Cusic, the club captain of his Aussie-rules football club, the Dodges Ferry Sharks. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He had his first child recently, loves his footy, obviously,” Zurbo told me. “I did this the day Austin was born, as a present.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And that dancing girl? She’s my daughter. The first night I met Zurbo, he asked me what my two kids were into.

You can </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/opiniontoday?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">sign up here</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> to receive it each weekday.</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Among the many things that the American women’s soccer team got right over the last month was its approach to patriotism.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The players have strongly held views about injustices in the United States, and they didn’t hesitate to express those views. Team members spoke up about sexism, L.G.B.T. issues and President Trump. They never made the mistake of equating patriotism with nationalist jingoism. They understood that free speech is itself patriotic.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the team — and especially its biggest star, Megan Rapinoe — also did something else. They didn’t make the mistake of conspicuously rejecting American symbols during the World Cup. Rapinoe, who had previously knelt during the national anthem, stood for it during the World Cup. (In part, she was responding to pressure from team management, but I still think it was the right move for her own sake.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When progressive protesters reject American symbols, I think they’re making <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/opinion/columnists/kaepernick-nfl-protests-democrats-midterms.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a tactical mistake</a>. For one thing, they take attention away from their specific causes and turn attention toward the question of their patriotism. For another thing, protesting the anthem or the flag needlessly alienates people who otherwise who could be won over by substantive arguments.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many civil rights leaders of the 1960s <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/opinion/football-kneeling-winning-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">understood this dynamic</a>. They knew that their critics were going to call them all sorts of insults no matter what — “un-American” and “communist,” as well as racist slurs. But they also recognized that they could help their chances of winning over persuadable Americans by aligning their cause with the country’s stated values, like justice and freedom. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They said, in effect: We are the true patriots, because we want to help America live up to its ideals and create a more perfect union.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In its own<!-- --> <!-- -->way, the women’s soccer team accomplished this same balancing act. “I’m particularly and uniquely and very deeply American,” Rapinoe said during the tournament. “If we want to talk about the ideals we stand for, the song and the anthem and what we are founded on, I think I am extremely American. For the detractors, I would have them look hard into what I am actually saying, the actions I am doing. Maybe you don’t agree with every single way I do it, and that can be discussed. I know I am not perfect.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And at yesterday’s parade in New York to celebrate the team’s championship, the crowd offered a tweak to the usual “U.S.A, U.S.A.!” chant: “U.S.A! <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/opinion/uswnt-world-cup-soccer-pay.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Equal pay!</a>” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">For more …</strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/opinion/the-argument-nancy-pelosi.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">On this week’s episode of “The Argument” podcast</a>, I argued that Nike got this balance wrong by deciding not to sell a sneaker that featured an 18th-century American flag. Ross Douthat agreed with me and Michelle Goldberg disagreed, saying the cancellation of the shoe<span class=\"css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0\"> </span>— led by Colin Kaepernick — was the right move.

       " 'merkel-shaking': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany insisted on Wednesday that she was “well” and capable of fulfilling her job after she was seen shaking uncontrollably in public for the third time in less than a month, reviving concern about her health.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In videos of the event, she was seen struggling to remain still as her arms and legs began trembling while she stood beside Antti Rinne, the prime minister of Finland, watching a military honor guard.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As she had in the previous incidents, Ms. Merkel clasped her hands in front of her in an apparently futile attempt to contain the tremors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Speaking to reporters less than an hour later during a news briefing, Ms. Merkel said, “I am well.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pressed by a reporter for more of an explanation, Ms. Merkel said that the shaking on Wednesday was part of the psychological trauma she suffered after <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=HHfvJfVzw50\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">experiencing uncontrolled trembling under similar circumstances on June 18</a>, while appearing with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the full afternoon sun.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was clear in saying that I am doing well and I think that can be accepted,” the chancellor said on Wednesday. “I said that I’m trying to come to grips with standing out there shaking while Mr. Zelensky visited and I think it’s going to blow over sometime soon.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She added: “I’m not yet there yet, but I’m convinced that I am quite capable of doing my work.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A government spokesman deferred to Ms. Merkel’s comments and provided no additional information.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Her aides attributed the initial shaking to dehydration, a problem that has plagued the chancellor in the past. After that episode, she also appeared at a news conference a short time later and told reporters that she had drunk several glasses of water and was doing fine.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/world/europe/angela-merkel-shaking.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the trembling returned nine days later</a>, when she stood alongside the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, during a ceremony in the presidential palace. Although her aides again said that she was well, it became more of a concern. She later explained that episode as linked to what had happened during Mr. Zelensky’s visit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/world/europe/angela-merkel-trembling-germany.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Germans prize privacy</a> and the chancellor’s health is not usually a matter of public interest. But the trembling on Wednesday quickly shot to the top of online news sites and was discussed on 24-hour news channels.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I must live with this for a little while,” Ms. Merkel said. “But I think that just as it has come, it will go away again.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Barbara L. Milrod, a psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine, a medical school in New York, watched a video of Mrs. Merkel’s shaking and said that it did not look like an emotional or psychologically based symptom. A panic attack was unlikely, Dr. Milrod said, because those tend to be virtually invisible.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“But of course she would have to be examined” to make any valid determination, Dr. Milrod said.</p>',\n",

       " 'metal-straws-death': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A British woman was impaled by a metal straw after falling at her home, a coroner said in an <!-- -->inquest<!-- --> this week that highlighted the potential dangers of metal straws. Such straws have surged in popularity as cities, states and even countries have banned single-use plastic straws.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The woman, Elena Struthers-Gardner, 60, who had a disability, fell and sustained a traumatic brain injury in November when the 10-inch straw pierced her eye, according to the coroner’s report, which was released on Monday. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> “As a consequence of the fall, a stainless steel straw that was in a glass Kilner-style cup Mrs. Struthers-Gardner was carrying penetrated her left eye,” the report said, referring to a glass jar similar to a Mason jar that often has a lid. It called her death an accident.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The report, released in Bournemouth, about two hours southwest of London, said that she fell at her home on Nov. 22, and was taken to Southampton General Hospital, where she died the next day.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Struthers-Gardner’s wife, Mandy, said in a statement read at the inquest that her partner had been a former jockey and was prone to falls after a horseback riding injury when she was 21. She had scoliosis — a curvature of the spine — and had dealt with substance abuse issues, her wife said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Struthers-Gardner’s wife did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A British straw ban will go into effect in April, but the worldwide environmental push against single-use straws has encountered opposition from some caregivers and advocates for people with disabilities. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/07/11/627773979/why-people-with-disabilities-want-bans-on-plastic-straws-to-be-more-flexible\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">They have voiced worries</a> about the safety of rigid straws and the overall availability of straws for people who are unable to drink without them. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Clearly great care should be taken when using these metal straws,” said Brendan Allen, an assistant coroner, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/17756360.retired-jockey-died-fell-metal-drinking-straw/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">according to The Bournemouth Daily Echo</a>. “There is no give in them at all.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It seems to me these metal straws should not be used with any form of lid that holds them in place,” he added. “It seems the main problem here is if the lid hadn’t been in place, the straw would have moved away.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Kim Sauder, a Toronto-based blogger and Ph.D. student in disability studies, said that Ms. Struthers-Gardner’s death was a cautionary tale. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I don’t know if the ‘reusable straw,’ as the environmentally minded person conceives of them, are actually common enough yet to really know what dangers they pose,” Ms. Sauder said Wednesday. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“A straw ban is nothing but environmental theater,” <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/crippledscholar/status/1021809110289932289\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Ms. Sauder tweeted last year</a>. “The greatest accomplishment of the straw ban is genuinely the bigotry it has emboldened against disabled people.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many people with disabilities rely on straws to drink, Ms. Sauder said, but could have difficulties finding them in states and <!-- -->cities<!-- -->, such as California and Seattle, that have <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/03/climate/plastic-straw-bans.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">banned or restricted single-use straws</a>. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Starbucks <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/business/starbucks-plastic-straws.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">plans to eliminate</a> its ubiquitous green plastic straws at 28,000 of its locations around the world in 2020. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s not easy being green for Starbucks, however. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2016, the coffee chain <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/starbucks-recalls-2-5-million-metal-straws-after-reports-mouth-n622161\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">recalled stainless steel straws</a> sold at its shops because they posed an injury risk. At the time, Starbucks said it had received reports of three children in the United States and one in Canada who had been lacerated by the straws, which were sold with reusable beverage containers. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dentists say that improper use of metal or glass straws can also be bad for teeth. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Clearly, chewing on a metal or glass straw can be hazardous to your teeth and your health,” said Dr. Timothy Chase of SmilesNY Cosmetic and Implant Dentistry in New York. “Just like we tell people not to chew on pens.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Chase added that it’s important to keep reusable straws clean to avoid infection-causing bacteria. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Christina Trapani, the owner of Eco Maniac Company, which sells reusable straws, called Ms. Struthers-Gardner’s accident “horrible.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s an unfortunate example,” Ms. Trapani said. “Hopefully it won’t impact the movement.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Her company, which is based in Virginia Beach, sells steel, paper, glass, bamboo and silicone reusable straws. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Metal straws are, hands down, the most popular,” said Ms. Trapani, who started her company in 2008. “I’m sure that there will be some concern, especially with children and people with disabilities.” She said that flexible silicone straws were a practical alternative.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Americans use 170 million to 390 million straws a day, according to estimates from market research firms. (A widely cited statistic places the number higher, at 500 million, but that estimate <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/business/plastic-straws-ban-fact-check-nyt.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">is based on the research of a 9-year-old boy</a>.) </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those numbers, along with a viral video of a marine biologist <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://time.com/5339037/turtle-video-plastic-straw-ban/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">removing a plastic straw</a> from a sea turtle’s nose in 2015, have influenced policymakers.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Christine Hauser contributed reporting. </em></p>',\n",

That means <!-- -->we have to get up close <!-- -->to engineer new materials. Really close.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Different microscopy techniques allow scientists to see the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/science/microscopes-cell-biology-dna.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">nucleotide-by-nucleotide genetic sequences</a> in cells down to the resolution of a couple atoms as seen in an atomic force microscopy image. But <!-- -->scientists at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., and the Institute for Basic Sciences in Seoul, have taken imaging a step further, developing a new magnetic resonance imaging technique that provides unprecedented detail, right down to the individual atoms of a sample.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The technique relies on the same basic physics behind the M.R.I. scans that are done in hospitals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When doctors want to detect tumors, measure brain function or visualize the structure of joints, they employ huge M.R.I. machines, which apply a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/well/live/do-mri-scans-cause-any-harm.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">magnetic field across the human body</a>. This temporarily disrupts the protons spinning in the nucleus of every atom in every cell. A subsequent, brief pulse of radio-frequency energy causes the protons to spin perpendicular to the pulse. Afterward, the protons return to their normal state, releasing energy that can be measured by sensors and made into an image.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But to gather enough diagnostic data, traditional hospital M.R.I.s must scan billions and billions of protons in a person’s body, said Christopher Lutz, a physicist at IBM. So he and his colleagues <!-- -->decided to pack the power of an M.R.I. machine<!-- --> into the tip of another specialized instrument known as a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE2yE8SvHmA\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">scanning tunneling microscope</a> to see if they could image individual atoms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The tip of a scanning tunneling microscope is just a few atoms wide. And it moves along the surface of a sample, it picks up details about the size and conformation of molecules.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The researchers attached magnetized iron atoms to the tip, effectively combining scanning-tunneling microscope and M.R.I. technologies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the magnetized tip swept over a metal wafer of iron and titanium, it applied a magnetic field to the sample, disrupting the electrons (rather than the protons, as a typical M.R.I. would) within each atom. Then the researchers quickly turned a radio-frequency pulse on and off, so that the electrons would emit energy that could be visualized. The results were described Monday in the journal <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0573-x\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Nature Physics</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a really magnificent combination of imaging technologies,” said A.

But that site, called <!-- -->Tranquillity Base<!-- -->, may not be as enduring as the legacy those prints represent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Is there anything stopping you from just driving over Neil Armstrong’s footprints?” said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/steven-a-mirmina/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Steve Mirmina</a>, a specialist in space law at Georgetown University. “No. There’s nothing.

With a few crucial exceptions, what happens off-world stays off-world, and activities on the lunar surface are largely unregulated. Various private space actors have already demonstrated a proclivity for celestial shenanigans: Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/science/falcon-heavy-spacex-launch.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">launched his car into space</a>. Rocket Lab, the builder of small rockets, shot <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/science/rocket-lab-humanity-star.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a disco ball-like object into orbit </a>from New Zealand. And <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/cellphones-moon-4g-network.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Vodafone</a> has hinted at building a cell tower on the moon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More seriously, a modern-day space race between governments and private companies is fast-tracking plans to return both humans and robotic landers to the lunar surface. One of those companies, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://ptscientists.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">PTScientists</a> of Berlin, announced a plan to land near — and examine — the site of <!-- -->Apollo 17<!-- -->, <!-- -->where humans last traipsed across the lunar surface<!-- -->. Now, some are saying, it is time to get serious about preserving humanity’s heritage on the moon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Earth, multiple layers of legislation, both international and domestic, protect many sites of humanity’s heritage, an array including<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/373\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> the megaliths at Stonehenge</a>, Yosemite National Park and the recently listed Smith-Carter House in Madison, Tenn.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In space, it is different. As decreed by the United Nations’ Outer Space Treaty in 1967 — signed by a multitude of nations while the United States and Soviet Union battled for primacy in orbit — space “shall be free for exploration and use by all,” with open access to all areas of celestial bodies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Put simply, space is the province of humankind. No nation can “own” it or claim it, by means of use or occupation or otherwise.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That complicates setting up protected areas or restricting activities in or under the six Apollo landing sites. Or the spot where the Soviet Luna 2 spacecraft landed in 1959 and became the first human-made piece of hardware to touch another world. Or the site where, in January, China’s Chang’e-4 spacecraft achieved the first landing on the far side of the moon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Arguably, by saying, ‘Oh, this bootprint is an artifact, don’t step on it’ — the U.S. would be making a territorial claim to the area where that bootprint is,” Ms. Hanlon said. “And as you can imagine, that would not be a very diplomatic thing to do.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To be clear, she added, individual objects on the moon remain the property of the nations that put them there; that is laid out in Article VIII of the Outer Space Treaty. (So, fair warning, retrieving and selling the golf balls Apollo 14’s Alan Shepard lobbed into oblivion or painting a smiley face on China’s Yutu rover will most likely land you in a world of trouble.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But so far, there has not been an easy way <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://spacegrant.nmsu.edu/lunarlegacies/archeologicalsitemap.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">to preserve the landing sites as they are</a>, with moon buggy treads and footprints intact, in the way an archaeologist of the future might want to study them. Amending the Outer Space Treaty could take decades, and there is no other obvious route to an international agreement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We lose so much on Earth inadvertently,” said<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://anthropology.nmsu.edu/anthropology-faculty/oleary/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> Beth O’Leary</a> of New Mexico State University, an archaeologist who has proposed preserving humanity’s off-world history. “Here, we have the opportunity to plan for what to preserve for the future — it’s always bad to do things kind of in hindsight.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That does not mean people have not tried to protect humanity’s lunar heritage.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Attempts to classify the Apollo landing sites as American national parks failed precisely because that would violate the Outer Space Treaty. And the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which designates world heritage sites, usually considers nominations only by countries exercising sovereignty over their proposed site — which can therefore only be on Earth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In July 2011, NASA <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/617743main_NASA-USG_LUNAR_HISTORIC_SITES_RevA-508.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">issued a nonbinding set of recommendations</a> aimed at preserving the six Apollo “heritage” sites and their associated artifacts. At the time, private teams were racing to be first on the lunar surface to claim <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://lunar.xprize.org/prizes/google-lunar\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the Google Lunar X Prize</a>, and one of the contest’s bonus prizes would go to a spacecraft that visited an Apollo site.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Experts fear future visitors to the moon could be similarly motivated, and with perhaps less oversight.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you’re a couple of college students and you have a rover and iPhone, of course you’re going to want to drive around and go to the Apollo landing sites,” Mr. Mirmina said. “You’d want to take a photo of the first footprints, maybe see if the flag is still standing, or take a photo of all the bags of poop that NASA left behind on the moon.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Thus NASA laid out guidelines for preserving those locations, including restrictions on overflights, boundaries for touchdown and a prohibition on close visits to the Apollo 11 and 17 sites because they “carry special historical and cultural significance.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then, the space agency reached an agreement with companies vying for the moon: They would need to abide by NASA’s guidelines if they wanted NASA support.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s carefully written, and NASA actually found some fairly clever ways of trying to enforce that,” said<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://elliott.gwu.edu/henry-hertzfeld\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> Henry Hertzfeld</a>, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last year, the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the White House issued <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Protecting-and-Preserving-Apollo-Program-Lunar-Landing-Sites-and-Artifacts.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">its own document</a> outlining the necessity of securing those sites. But Dr. Hertzfeld says it is a long road to building a functional and enforceable international legal framework for preservation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet in May, Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, introduced a bill, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s1694\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space Act</a>, which directs any federal agency that issues licenses for lunar activities to require that companies comply with the 2011 NASA guidelines. The bill, co-sponsored by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, is headed for a vote in the full Senate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These are the first archaeological sites outside of planet Earth and as we move toward being a spacefaring society and civilization, it is only right that we protect those giant leaps,” Mr. Peters said. He added that “once they’re degraded, they’re lost forever to humanity.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While many key moon sites are American, proponents say the endeavor to preserve lunar sites will not — and cannot — be America-centric.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is a very human story and we want people all over the world to embrace it as a human story,” Ms. Hanlon said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the fact that so many sites are the result of American achievements might portend trouble.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Restricting access to historical sites on the moon might “limit the freedom of exploration,” Mari Eldholm, government relations manager for <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://ptscientists.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">PTScientists</a>, said in an email, and could also be seen as one country appropriating something that belongs to all of humanity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">PTScientists is designing a mission to the Apollo 17 site. As envisioned, that mission would employ a lander and two lunar rovers. One goal would be investigating how Apollo artifacts have been affected by nearly 50 years in the lunar environment, which necessarily involves altering the site’s present state.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And right now, PTScientists could modify the Apollo 17 terrain in any way it wants — although Ms. Eldholm said the company would do its best to follow and respect NASA’s guidelines. But she emphasizes that an international conversation about balancing lunar preservation, exploration and freedom is essential.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We believe there is a need for a discussion on who decides, and what, to preserve,” she said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But there is no simple way to address preservation in today’s international arena.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You get into the world political situation today and it’s not one of making treaties,” Dr. Hertzfeld said. “You’ve got more nations that are technically capable of accessing space, and doing a lot up there.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Hanlon — whose group, For All Moonkind, continues raising the issue at United Nations assemblies — says that trying to protect those sites is worth the effort. Losing these records of humanity’s first accomplishments in space would be devastating for future generations, she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’ve done it wrong so many times on Earth, but we have a lot of examples and experiences to work from,” she said. “I think we can do it right on the moon and other celestial bodies.”</p>',\n",

But our ability to really know our moon was not always this easy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The beginning of the moon race in 1959 offered our first real glimpses of the surface, with Soviet probes sending the first close-up pictures back to Earth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We inched closer with <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/science/earthrise-moon-apollo-nasa.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the Apollo 8 flyby in 1968</a>. No humans had ever been so near. For the first time, our view was swapped — it was the pockmarked lunar surface in the foreground, and our blue speckled Earth in the distance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But it really took landing on the moon with Apollo 11 to turn this alien world into a familiar one. And there is still much to see. The Chinese space program recently landed on <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/03/science/china-change-4-moon-landing.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the moon’s far side for our first close-up view there</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For millenniums the moon was a thing of legend. People believed that it controlled our moods, our behaviors and even our destinies. This divine assignment found its way into myths, literature and, of course, art.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Both before and after the invention of the telescope, artists and amateur astronomers were looking at the moon, interpreting what they saw, and trying to reconcile this with religious and philosophical beliefs at the time,” says David Bardeen, an art historian at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Art helped negotiate all of the questions that were being raised.”</p><p>Universal History Archive/UIG, via Getty images</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the oldest portrayals of the moon was made at the height of the Bronze Age. The two-dimensional sculpture, forged from metal and gold, is called the Nebra Sky Disk because of where it was discovered in Germany. It dates to 1600 B.C. and is one of the oldest known depictions of the cosmos. Art historians believe it was probably an astronomical tool, hinting at how some Bronze Age cultures kept watch on the sky.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To the East and many centuries later, the crescent moon appeared in a sculpture called the Stele of Nabonidus. In ancient Babylon, King Nabonidus worshiped the moon god, called Sin, represented as the crescent moon. The king even gestures upward as a mark of his devotion. This piece dates to the sixth century B.C., during the last neo-Babylonian era, when religious worship of the moon was common.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many older pieces, like this stele, connect the moon to a deity. But as technology developed, our relationship to the moon began to change.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In fall 1609, Galileo Galilei used his new telescope to look at the moon from the hills of Tuscany. The object he had before seen only with his eyes suddenly became more complex.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Originally trained as an artist, he grabbed watercolors and his notebook and painted the surface of the moon over a few months, documenting how the shadows changed and the light collected in craters of different sizes. Soon after, he published these drawings in a journal called “Sidereus Nuncius<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">”</em> with support of the Medici family in Florence. This astronomical treatise was then widely distributed, making visual access to the moon’s surface available to some for the first time in history.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Suddenly, in Galileo’s watercolors, the austere lunar facade was filled with valleys and craters, making Earth and the moon more similar than previously imagined.</p><p>Stbalbach, via Wikimedia</p><p>Commons</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although Galileo revealed that the moon was not merely a smooth, featureless orb, artists continued finding symbolic meanings in our lunar neighbor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Artists use the moon symbolically, but the ways in which they paint it often bear little relationship to scientific discoveries,” Caroline Campbell, director of research at the National Gallery in London, said. “The moon is a very powerful way of showing the ‘other.’ Something alien and different.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nearly three centuries after Galileo, a Japanese woodblock artist, Taiso Yoshitoshi, created a series of prints called “One Hundred Aspects of the Moon.” At a time when Western influence was high, Yoshitoshi made a concerted effort to bring Japanese and Chinese lunar myths back into popular art.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of his most famous pieces, “Cassia Tree Moon (Tsuki no Katsura),” depicts Wu Gang of the Han dynasty, who abused his power after becoming fluent in Taoist magic. As punishment he is sentenced for eternity to chop down the cassia trees that grow on the moon. Once removed with his giant ax, they would immediately grow back.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The full transition of the moon in the Western imagination — from light source, to a symbol, into simply an object of nature to be documented — may have been completed in the 19th century with what is perhaps the most famous depiction of the night sky.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 1889, Vincent van Gogh admired the moon through his bedroom window at the asylum at St.-Rémy-de-Provence. “Starry Night” is almost an overwhelming dance of brush strokes, like starlight that has been smeared and animated. But as if it were the only static object in the night sky, the crescent moon rests in the upper right of the painting. While wholly unrealistic, van Gogh’s impression of the natural world manages to not only invoke a real sense of what the night sky looked like, but also how it felt to see it. This is one of the first major works of art that provides us with a sense of the night without relying on myth or religious symbols.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Earlier in the same century, the moon started to be an object for the imagination to explore.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The cover of “From the Earth to the Moon,” an 1865 novel by Jules Verne and illustrated by a French artist, Henri de Montaut, showed a giant rocket ship en route to a moon so large it is almost swelling from the page.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This heavily read novel and its cover transformed the moon from something more than merely symbolic or scientific. The moon became a destination.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">About a century after Verne’s and Montaut’s vision, an actual spaceship landed on the moon. On July 21, 1969, the world slowed down to watch one of the most important and connective moments in human history. Dinners went cold as families stayed up late, staring at their television sets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nearly 4,000 years after the Nebra Sky Disk was forged in bronze and gold, Neil Armstrong walked a few steps down a ladder and placed his boot in the fine light-gray moon dust. Across the world, antennas picked up the video. Here was a man in a puffy white spacesuit — after millenniums of observing, of wondering, of seeing the moon as only a symbol. We were all standing there with him.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And just like that, the moon — much more than a featureless symbolic orb — was a real part of our collective memory and history.</p>',\n",

Geologists wanted the two men, Apollo 15 astronauts, to collect samples that would shed light on the moon’s mysterious formation and early years. On their second day there, Aug. 1, 1971, Mr. Scott and Mr. Irwin hit the jackpot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They were taking samples inside the moon’s Mare Imbrium, or Sea of Rains, when Mr. Scott saw an unusual rock. He walked up to it, lifted it and dusted it off. Mr. Irwin saw right away that the rock was special.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Oh, man!” Mr. Irwin shouted. “Look at the glint!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Both astronauts shouted with glee.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think we found what we came for,” Mr. Scott radioed Houston. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rock was an anorthosite, made when a mineral called feldspar crystallized inside molten rock. Its existence hinted that the moon was once coated in an ocean of magma, where the feldspar crystals would have floated like icebergs. It was thought to represent part of the moon’s primordial crust, and reporters covering the mission soon nicknamed it “genesis rock.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That tells you about the source material that went into the moon, and narrows down what formed the moon,” said Ryan Zeigler, the curator for NASA’s Apollo rocks at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before the Apollo missions, astronomers debated several explanations for how the moon was made. Some argued that the moon was forged alongside Earth, while others thought that it formed elsewhere in the solar system and that Earth’s gravity captured it. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.lindahall.org/george-howard-darwin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">George Howard Darwin</a>, an English astronomer and the son of Charles Darwin, proposed that it was flung from the infant Earth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Scientists studying the genesis rock developed a new story. Soon after Earth coalesced, about 4.5 billion years ago, a Mars-size object called Theia, named for the mother of the moon goddess in Greek mythology, crashed into our young planet. Earth might have liquefied, while Theia shattered and its remnants formed the moon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But in recent years, many details of this “giant impact hypothesis” have come into question.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2001, Swiss researchers remeasured 30 Apollo samples with modern instruments and found that their variants of oxygen were indistinguishable from those on Earth. In the years since, geochemists have studied titanium, tungsten and many other metals from Earth and the moon, and nobody can tell them apart.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This is strange. If the moon was made from Theia, it should look like Theia, not Earth. And Theia should be chemically distinct from Earth, just as the other planets are all different from one another.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To solve this problem, theorists are making tweaks to their computer simulations. In a report published in April, Japanese scientists, led by Natsuki Hosono of the Yokohama Institute for Earth Sciences, described how <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/science/moon-earth-collision.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the still-molten Earth might have sloughed off the moon</a>, so long as Theia thwacked the planet while it was still covered in a magma ocean.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another theory, first proposed in 2017, calls for Theia and Earth to vaporize, forming a bagel-shaped cloud of fire that is neither a planet nor a disc. The short-lived structure, called a synestia, is a scorching gas blob with outer edges rotating so fast that they essentially launch into orbit. Once it begins to cool and solidify, rock droplets condense and fall onto the embryonic planet at the center. Leftover debris in the outer edges of the bagel would also condense, but at a greater distance, forming the moon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We can’t use current lunar accretion models to study this,” Simon J. Lock, a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology who developed the theory with Sarah Stewart at the University of California, Davis, said in March at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston. “We need to include differential equations, and we need to include the physics. It’s going to be hard — I’m sorry. But if we want to understand how our moon formed, and link its chemical properties to its origin, we need to overcome these challenges.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The moon’s younger days are also the subject of intense debate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mare Imbrium, where Mr. Scott and Mr. Irwin touched down, is a vast lava plain and impact crater that formed about 3.8 billion years ago, when a titanic asteroid or protoplanet collided with the moon. When scientists started measuring Apollo samples, they found most of them had experienced some kind of horrific heating around that time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 1974, researchers argued that the inner solar system was pounded by asteroids that suddenly migrated inward, an event called the lunar cataclysm, or the Late Heavy Bombardment. Earth has erased the craters that would have formed back then, a result of plate tectonics. But the moon still bears a record of this pummeling.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The onslaught looms large in how we understand the history of the solar system. But in recent years, many scientists have come to believe it never happened.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">NASA chose the landing site in Mare Imbrium in part because geologists wanted a sample just like the genesis rock, which is one reason Mr. Scott and Mr. Irwin were so happy that day. But today, some geologists think the ejecta from the singular Imbrium impact may have traveled across great portions of the moon’s near side, including the regions sampled by the six Apollo missions. That could mean <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/06/science/neil-armstrong-moon-rocks.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the Apollo rocks</a> are systematically biased.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In my opinion, the cataclysm does not exist, but is an artifact of the Apollo samples,” Harald Hiesinger, a geologist at the University of Münster in Germany, said at the Houston meeting.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sometime in the next year, NASA will open three new samples that have been in storage since they were brought to Earth in the 1970s. Managers at the agency want to train a new generation of scientists who will study moon rocks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s not that we don’t care anymore because we’re getting new ones, but because we need to learn more about curation and how to handle the samples,” said Sarah Noble, program scientist for NASA’s Apollo Next Generation Sample Analysis group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Zeigler said a fresh look at Apollo samples, including new analysis of pristine rocks that have been sealed since being brought down to Earth in 1972, would help tell a more complete story of the moon’s birth and early years. But many scientists are hoping for entirely new rocks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There’s still a lot to learn about the moon from the Apollo samples,” Dr. Zeigler said. “But the next big leap is new samples from somewhere else.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That may happen soon, and it could help overcome the sample-bias problem.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In May, the Trump administration declared plans to return humans to the moon by 2024, under a program called Artemis. And a Chinese mission, Chang’e 5, is also planned to bring home a sample from the moon.</p>',\n",

A ballroom packed with scientists erupted in exuberant applause.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Neil turned out to be the best field geologist on the moon,” he added. “Until Apollo 17, of course. In 20 minutes or so, he collected a fantastic suite of samples.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before Apollo 11, even simple questions about the moon confounded scientists. For instance, how old was it, <!-- -->anyway?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Once they started examining the 50 pounds of rocks and soil brought back by Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the answer quickly became clear: very, very old.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Schmitt said that had the Apollo program stopped then, with no additional landings, including his own, those first lunar samples would have been enough to forever reshape knowledge of the solar system.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Armstrong collected two types of rocks: basalts, which are hardened pieces of lava, and breccias, which are fragments of older rocks fused together. The landing site was within a flat lava plain, which was chosen because it appeared to be a safe place to touch down, not because it looked scientifically intriguing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nonetheless, the basalts rewrote solar system history. The relative amounts of certain long-lived radioactive elements within the rocks gave a range of ancient ages, unchanged since they cooled and solidified out of lava between 3.6 billion and 3.9 billion years ago. That is far older than <!-- -->almost all of the rocks on Earth, which have been churned, compressed, melted and resolidified over the eons. In fact, the moon rocks were nearly as old as <!-- -->the<!-- --> Earth a<!-- -->nd <!-- -->the solar system, which formed 4.5 billion years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“<!-- -->Right there, we knew the moon was going to be, at least in part, the record for the early history of the Earth<!-- -->,” <!-- -->Dr. Schmitt said. <!-- -->“That was not clearly understood before Apollo 11. But it is clearly understood afterwards and now.<!-- -->”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another major discovery lay within soil that Armstrong had picked up and dropped into the collection box, <!-- -->because it was not yet packed full<!-- -->. The soil contained bits of a rock known as anorthosite. Just as ice floats on water, anorthosite, made of the mineral plagioclase, floats on magma.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Within half a year after Apollo 11, two teams of scientists, one at the University of Chicago, the other at Harvard, independently used the presence of anorthosite to come up with what was then a radical notion: The moon, the scientists proposed, had at one point melted into a global ocean of magma.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Buoyant anorthosite would then have risen to the surface while heavier materials, like iron, would have sunk to the core. Speculation of a lunar magma ocean, in turn, led to the hypothesis that the moon formed out of the debris from a collision between Earth and a Mars-size body. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The concept, the phrase magma ocean, didn’t exist until Apollo 11,” Dr. Schmitt said in an interview. “That’s the way science moves.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/science/moon-facts.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Rocks from later Apollo missions</a> added evidence to the theory</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Armstrong’s soil <!-- -->also contained hydrogen, helium, nitrogen and carbon, much of which had been <!-- -->deposited<!-- --> by the solar wind, the stream of high-speed particles continually flying outward from the sun. A light version of helium, helium-3, is of particular future interest as fuel for fusion reactors, which could generate bountiful, nearly clean energy by combining atoms.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It told us there were going to be tremendous amounts of potential resources for use in space, and possibly even on Earth,” Dr. Schmitt said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another far-reaching scientific legacy of the moon rocks<!-- --> gathered by the Apollo astronauts<!-- --> is how scientists used them to calibrate a technique of using craters to determine the ages of places in the solar system.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The concept is simple. Over time, impacts of asteroids, big and small, pocked the surface of the moon and elsewhere. But a layer of ice or lava can erase the craters and reset the clock. Thus, a heavily cratered surface is older than a smooth one. But while planetary scientists could see which places were older and which were younger, they did not know exactly how old any of them were.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With the dating of the rocks taken from Apollo 11’s landing site, scientists then knew the age of that patch of the lunar surface. Rocks from the other five Apollo landings set the ages of those corresponding regions, which then correlated with the different numbers of craters in each place.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The calibrated crater counts are now used to determine ages of bodies throughout the inner solar system.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The dating record still contains a huge two-billion-year gap, from one billion years ago to three billion years ago, because all of the Apollo missions touched down on older swaths of the moon. Scientists have tried to extrapolate the ages of younger regions, but different guesses provide a wide range of age estimates.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Which is the correct chronology?” David Draper, NASA’s deputy chief scientist, asked. “That part of the curve is unconstrained. We desperately need new samples.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Draper is part of a team that has<!-- --> proposed a robotic mission called <!-- -->the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2019/eposter/1110.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Inner Solar System Chronology</a>, or Isochron, which<!-- --> would grab five ounces of rock from a younger, smoother part of the moon and whisk it back to Earth, where scientists would determine the age of the sample.<!-- --> </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Future robotic explorers may one day accomplish much more on the lunar surface than Armstrong could in 1969 with his space-suited hands holding a sampling stick. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But it took the humanity in that test pilot who moonlighted as a field geologist to pause from his collecting and take in the lunar landscape.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It has a stark beauty all its own,” <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Armstrong said </a><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">not long after taking his first steps on the moon</a>. “It’s like much of the high desert of the United States.

       " 'obamacare-appeals-court': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">NEW ORLEANS — A panel of federal appeals court judges on Tuesday sounded likely to uphold a lower-court ruling that a central provision of the Affordable Care Act — the requirement that most people have health insurance — is unconstitutional. But it was harder to discern how the court might come down on a much bigger question: whether the rest of the sprawling health law must fall if the insurance mandate does.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 90 minutes of oral arguments on whether a federal district judge in Texas was correct in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/health/obamacare-unconstitutional-texas-judge.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">striking down the Affordable Care Act</a> in December, two appellate judges appointed by Republican presidents peppered lawyers with blunt questions while the third judge, appointed by President Jimmy Carter, remained silent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The two Republican appointees, Jennifer Walker Elrod, appointed by President George W. Bush in 2007, and Kurt Engelhardt, appointed by President Trump in 2018, seemed particularly skeptical of the Democratic defendants’ argument that Congress had fully intended to keep the rest of the law when it eliminated the penalty for going without insurance as part of its 2017 tax overhaul.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The arguments in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit were a stark reminder of the enormous stakes of the case, not only for millions of people who gained health insurance through the law but for the political futures of Mr. Trump and other candidates in the 2020 elections.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The case, which could make its way to the Supreme Court ahead of those elections, threatens insurance protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions and many other sweeping changes the 2010 law has made throughout the health care system.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was filed by a group of Republican governors and attorneys general against the federal government, which carries out the law. But the Trump administration refused to defend the full law in court, initially saying only its provisions protecting people with pre-existing conditions should be struck down. Then, this spring, it said it agreed with the ruling that the law’s requirement for people to buy insurance was unconstitutional now that Congress eliminated the penalty for going without it, and that as a result, the entire law must be dismantled.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That has left a group of 21 states with Democratic attorneys general to intervene to defend the law, along with the House of Representatives, which entered the case after Democrats won control of the chamber last fall.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A question at the heart of the case that was much discussed during Tuesday’s arguments is whether the Affordable Care Act’s mandate requiring most Americans to buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty remained constitutional after Congress eliminated the penalty. When the Supreme Court upheld the mandate in its <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">landmark 2012 ruling</a> that saved the law, its decision was based on Congress’s power to impose taxes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If the mandate is indeed unconstitutional, the next question is whether the rest of the Affordable Care Act can function without it. In December, Judge Reed O’Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth said it could not and declared that the entire law must fall. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Tuesday, Douglas N. Letter, a lawyer for the House of Representatives, was particularly insistent that Judge O’Connor had been wrong, telling the appeals panel that “the burden is on the other side to show Congress wanted this entire statute to be struck down.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The arguments did reveal some tensions between the Republican states that brought the case, led by Texas, and Mr. Trump’s Justice Department. For example, a lawyer for Texas took issue with a puzzling new Justice Department position — revealed in a May brief — that the ruling should apply only in the 18 plaintiff states, not nationwide. The Republican states would need to evaluate if they had “been the victim of a bait and switch,” said the Texas lawyer, Kyle D. Hawkins.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In another wrinkle, August E. Flentje, a lawyer for the Justice Department, appeared reluctant to answer questions from Judge Elrod about how applying the ruling only to the plaintiff states would work. He was also vague about another new and surprising position the administration mentioned almost in passing in its May brief: that some pieces of the health law, though not its insurance provisions, should be preserved.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“A lot needs to get sorted out and it’s complicated,” Mr. Flentje replied.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Judge Elrod also asked how the federal government would respond if a stay issued by the lower court after Judge O’Connor’s decision was lifted and its order striking down the law took effect.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We think it’s great the stay is in place,” Mr. Flentje said. “Those things don’t need to get sorted out until there’s a final ruling.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over all, though, the panel spent the most time on the question of whether the rest of the law should fall if Judge O’Connor was correct in scrapping the insurance mandate — and Judge Elrod and Judge Engelhardt, based on their questioning, seemed to firmly believe he was. Judge Engelhardt asked Mr. Letter, the House lawyer, why Congress could not remedy the situation by writing a new health law or set of laws.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They could do this tomorrow,” Judge Engelhardt said, leading Mr. Letter to dryly point out that Mr. Trump would need to sign off on new laws, too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“And obviously the president would sign this, right?” he asked sardonically. “No, obviously not.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You can fix this, and the Supreme Court has told you how to do it,” Mr. Letter told the panel, referring to legal precedent that directs courts to limit damage to major statutes when considering which provisions to throw out. “Maintain everything you can that can stand on its own.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Judge Engelhardt and Judge Elrod kept referring to past statements, including from Supreme Court justices in an earlier case questioning the constitutionality of the health law, King v. Burwell, suggesting that the law’s other insurance provisions cannot work without the mandate. Those provisions include one that requires insurance companies to sell health coverage to anyone who wants to buy it, including people with pre-existing medical conditions, and another that requires the companies to charge the same price to everyone who is the same age.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Judge Engelhardt twice asked Mr. Letter why, if Congress fully intended to keep the rest of the health law when it eliminated the penalty for going without insurance in 2017, the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans, had not also sent a lawyer to make that case.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Why would the Senate not also be here to say, ‘Oh, this is what we meant when we wrote this?’” he asked. “They’re sort of the 800-pound gorilla that’s not in the room.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The appeals panel also spent a good chunk of the allotted 90 minutes asking questions on a third topic: whether the Democratic states and House of Representatives even have standing to appeal Judge O’Connor’s ruling. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To establish standing, a party has to show it has suffered a concrete injury that a ruling in its favor would redress. Samuel P. Siegel, a lawyer for California, told the appeals panel that throwing out the law would clearly injure the defendant states because they would lose hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds they have received through the expansion of Medicaid and other provisions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The court had also asked the parties in a letter last month what the appropriate conclusion of the case should be if the Justice Department, by no longer defending any part of the law, has “mooted the controversy.” But it barely addressed that question on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If the appeals court ultimately decides that neither the House nor the intervening Democratic states have standing, it could either let Judge O’Connor’s ruling stand or vacate it. In any event, the losing party will almost certainly appeal to the Supreme Court.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“All of this is going to be playing out against the backdrop of the 2020 presidential election,” said Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan. He was among a bipartisan group of professors <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Texas-v.-US-Law-Profs-Amicus-Br.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">who argued in an amicus brief</a> last year that the rest of the law should survive even if its mandate to buy insurance was found unconstitutional, and who have criticized the plaintiffs’ case as weak.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Democrats are already running ads against Mr. Trump and other Republicans over the case, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/452034-dem-campaign-group-targets-republican-attorneys-general-trying-to-undo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">including five state attorneys general</a> who signed on as plaintiffs and will be up for re-election next fall. Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the law, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.protectourcare.org/new-ad-protect-our-care-sounds-alarm-on-disastrous-impact-of-trumps-texas-lawsuit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">will start running digital ads</a> this week against Republican senators considered vulnerable next year: Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The case, if successful, would result in a humanitarian catastrophe in this country,” Senator Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. “Because the plaintiffs in the case, backed by the Trump administration, are arguing that the court should throw out the entire Affordable Care Act with nothing to replace it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The appeals court could take months to decide, but the Trump administration has said it will continue to enforce the many provisions of the law until a final ruling is issued — a position about which Judge Elrod expressed curiosity. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a choice, right?” she said to Mr. Flentje, the Justice Department lawyer, asking why the administration would keep the law afloat even after it had changed its position and agreed it was fully unconstitutional.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If the appeals judges uphold Judge O’Connor’s decision, the number of uninsured people in America would increase by almost 20 million, or 65 percent, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/100000/repeal_of_the_aca_by_state.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">according to the Urban Institute</a>, a left-leaning research organization. That includes millions who gained coverage through the law’s expansion of Medicaid, and millions more who receive subsidized private insurance through the law’s online marketplaces.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Insurers would also no longer have to cover young adults under their parents’ plans up to age 26; annual and lifetime limits on coverage would again be permitted; and there would be no cap on out-of-pocket medical costs people have to pay.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Also gone would be the law’s popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions, which became a major talking point in last fall’s midterm elections, as Democratic candidates constantly reminded voters that congressional Republicans had tried to repeal the law in 2017.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Without those protections, insurers could return to denying coverage to such people or to charging them more. They could also return to charging people more based on their age, gender or profession.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/pre-existing-conditions-and-medical-underwriting-in-the-individual-insurance-market-prior-to-the-aca/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">has estimated that 52 million adults from 18 to 64</a>, or 27 percent of that population, would be rejected for individual market coverage under the practices that were in effect in most states before the Affordable Care Act.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">Jan Hoffman contributed reporting.</p>',\n",

I’ve recovered, and now I’m here.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since 2012, Sagan has failed to win the green jersey just once, when he was disqualified after a crash with Mark Cavendish two years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Wednesday, he surged ahead in the middle of the road to edge Wout van Aert and Matteo Trentin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I just have to ride with passion, and the victory comes,” Sagan said. “I have to say thanks to all my teammates. They have done a great job and finally we have the Tour de France victory that we were looking for. It’s very nice for us. We controlled all day, on the flat part and toward the finish. I did my best. Everyone needs good luck and a good day for winning.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The sprint was not contested by pure specialists, who got dropped over the four climbs on the day’s program.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Alaphilippe finished in the main pack alongside other main contenders, including the defending champion, Geraint Thomas, with no change at the top of the overall standings.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The stage got off to a lively start, and a group of four riders managed to break away from the pack after a series of unsuccessful attacks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mads Würtz, Tim Wellens, Toms Skujins and Simon Clarke collaborated well and built a two-minute lead over the peloton. The pace at the back of the race picked up in the second half of the stage, but the quartet went over the summit of the côte du Haut-Koenigsbourg with 1 minute 45 seconds on their pursuers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Skujins, a Latvian, attacked in the côte des Trois-Épis — a 4.9-kilometer climb at an average gradient of 6.8 percent — to drop his breakaway companions with a sustained effort. His lead over the main pack was reduced to one minute at the top and he was caught in the final difficulty on the program, the côte des Cinq Châteaux.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hostilities between the race favorites are expected to start during Thursday’s first key stage to the Planche des Belles Filles, a leg-breaking climb likely to shuffle the standings.</p>',\n",

       " 'philippines-duterte-killings-un': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">GENEVA — The United Nations’ top human rights body voted on Thursday to examine thousands of alleged extrajudicial police killings linked to President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs in the Philippines, a campaign that rights groups around the world have denounced as a lawless atrocity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The United Nations’ 47-member Human Rights Council supported a resolution led by Iceland that turned a spotlight on wide-ranging abuses, including killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, and persecution of rights activists, journalists, lawyers and members of the political opposition.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Despite fierce opposition from Philippine officials, 18 countries backed the resolution, while 14 opposed it, and 15 others abstained.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Philippine foreign minister, Teodoro Locsin, in a statement read by his ambassador in Geneva, denounced the resolution as a travesty of human rights that came “straight from the mouth of the queen in Alice in Wonderland.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Do not presume to threaten states with accountability for a tough approach to crushing crime” in which some countries were complicit and others tolerant, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The resolution stopped short of setting up a full-fledged commission of inquiry, but calls on the United Nations human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, to prepare a comprehensive report for delivery to the council in a year’s time. That would set the stage for tougher follow-up action if abuses continued unabated, diplomats said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a modest resolution, but it is a very critical step to putting the Philippines on the track to accountability, and to show that the killing of thousands of drug war victims has not gone unnoticed by the international community,” said Laila Matar, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s group monitoring the United Nations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the run-up to Thursday’s vote, Philippine diplomats lobbied fiercely to dissuade council members from supporting what they considered to be a hostile resolution. They fired off memorandums to diplomatic missions in Geneva challenging the initiative as an abuse of Human Rights Council procedures and a bad use of resources.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I have never seen a countercampaign of the level of this one by the Philippines,” Ms. Matar said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In light of that effort, supporters of the resolution considered it something of a victory that so many countries abstained rather than opposing the measure. The vote came just days after one of the drug war’s youngest victims, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/07/09/world/europe/09reuters-philippines-drugs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">3-year-old Myca Ulpina</a>, was killed in a police raid.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Philippine government has acknowledged at least 6,600 deaths in the antidrug campaign since 2016, but human rights groups believe the death toll is much higher.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">United Nations human rights experts called last month for an investigation into the “staggering number” of extrajudicial killings, which the Philippines’ human rights commission has estimated could run to more than 27,000.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Amnesty International, in a report last week, described Mr. Duterte’s war on drugs as “nothing but a large-scale murdering enterprise” mainly targeting the poor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is not safe to be poor in President Duterte’s Philippines. All it takes to be murdered is an unproven accusation that someone uses, buys or sells drugs,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s regional director for East and Southeast Asia. “It is time for the United Nations, starting with its Human Rights Council, to act decisively to hold President Duterte and his government accountable.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Duterte is scheduled to deliver his annual state of the nation address later this month, so the resolution “comes at a most pressing and opportune time,” said Cristina Palabay, secretary general of a Philippine human rights group, Karapatan. “This is not the end-all, be-all of our efforts to exact accountability, but we take it as a critical start.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Any inquiry looks set to infuriate Manila. Mr. Duterte has fired off insults at United Nations human rights experts, and the government sought to have the expert on the rights of indigenous people, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, declared a terrorist when she criticized the government’s actions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Human Rights Council resolution underscores the outsized influence small countries can wield — in particular, the surprising role of Iceland, with fewer than 400,000 people. Since taking the seat left vacant when the United States withdrew from the council last year, Iceland has actively supported several contentious resolutions that many other nations have avoided, for fear of retaliation by powerful states.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Iceland took the lead on a series of statements of concern on the Philippine drug war, supported an investigation into abuses in civil war in Yemen, backed calls for an international inquiry into the killing of Jamal Khashoggi by agents of Saudi Arabia, and this week joined a statement critical of China’s treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang province.</p>',\n",

The study, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-45400-y\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">published in June in Scientific Reports</a>, adds to a small clump of botanical eclipse research, all produced by people with the ability to wonder, even as a celestial event occurs: What are the plants getting up to?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Plants haven’t really been well-documented during the eclipse,” said Daniel Beverly, a Ph.D. student in botany and hydrology at the University of Wyoming and the paper’s lead author. When he heard an eclipse was coming, he saw the chance for “a once-in-a-lifetime data set.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Big sagebrush spends much of its life in the sun, and “it covers such a large portion of the country,” from Oregon down to New Mexico, Mr. Beverly said, making it a good subject for study. He and his colleagues chose a patch close to Yellowstone National Park. They set up instruments that could measure photosynthetic rate, as well as the speed of transpiration — how quickly its leaves lose water.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the light faded and the temperature dropped during the 80 or so minutes before totality, Mr. Beverly and his team saw a corresponding decrease in photosynthesis and transpiration. “The plant responded as if it was dusk,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During the two minutes and 18 seconds of complete darkness, both rates fell further. Although they did not quite reach the slowdown level of an average nighttime, it was a much more precipitous drop than would have occurred for a passing cloud.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But when the sun appeared again, the shrubs were blindsided.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That’s when we saw the most evident signals of stress,” said Mr. Beverly. “It caused a disruption in the photosynthetic pathways.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although they could not test this directly, he guesses that the shock of sudden sunlight messed with each plant’s circadian rhythm — the internal clock that determines an organism’s daily cycle of activity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over the course of the eclipse day, the team estimated, your average big sagebrush managed about 14 percent less photosynthesis than it would have if the sun hadn’t been blocked. If a plant is already drought-stressed, an eclipse might be bad news, like “losing 14 percent of a day’s income when you’re already broke,” Mr. Beverly said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Their findings follow a few other studies, including one done during an eclipse over Europe in 1999 that showed changes in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192302001260\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">sap flow</a> and transpiration in a beech tree near Ghent, Belgium. The tree <!-- -->“‘held its breath’ during the solar eclipse,”<!-- --> said Kathy Steppe, now a professor of plant ecology at Ghent University — meaning it stopped releasing water, even as its sap kept flowing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Beverly looks forward to the 2024 eclipse, which will sweep from Mexico through to the Eastern United States, when he plans to take a closer look at crop and tree responses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He’ll do one thing differently: “I would try to use as much automation as possible so I could actually enjoy the eclipse,” he said. “That’s a big thing I missed.”</p>',\n",

Coca-Cola and Pepsi, along with Dow, the plastics producer, support nonprofit groups like Keep America Beautiful, which organize events like litter cleanups. A recent <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3T4b6UKVMI\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">video</a> funded partly by Keep America Beautiful featured models dancing through a recycling facility in Brooklyn, which one advertising writer said makes “recycling sexy.” By 2030, Coca-Cola wants all of its packaging to be made from at least 50 percent recycled content.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But one approach to recycling that many of these companies do not support has proved to actually work: container deposit laws, more commonly known as bottle bills, which cost them lots of money.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/state-beverage-container-laws.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">10 states</a> where consumers can collect a few cents when they return an empty bottle or can, recycling rates for those containers are often significantly higher. In some cases, they are more than twice as high as in states without such deposits.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For decades, beverage companies, retailers and many of the nonprofit groups they control have fought to kill bottle bill proposals across the country — with great success. Since 1987, only one state, Hawaii, has passed a bottle bill. This year, such measures have been proposed in at least eight states. <!-- -->Nearly<!-- --> all have been rejected or failed to gain traction. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The result? Recycling in much of the country still depends almost entirely on the good will of consumers to place their used containers in a bin for pickup. The process is convenient, but means millions of bottles and cans head straight to a dump instead. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">[<em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">As costs skyrocket, </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/16/business/local-recycling-costs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">more cities in the United States are stopping recycling</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.</em>]</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The financial reason for such opposition is clear. If the other 40 states were to adopt expansive bottle bills, it could ultimately cost the industries billions more. The beverage industry says the bills function like a tax and allow governments to collect millions in unclaimed deposits. Beverage distributors, in many cases, also pay a handling fee for the processing of empty containers. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I am confident that the industry’s true rationale for opposing deposit laws is that they cost them money and they don’t want the expense,” said Susan Collins, president of the Container Recycling Institute, a research and advocacy group that supports bottle bills. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most recently, in Connecticut last month, the industry helped to soundly defeat a bill that would have expanded deposits to juice and energy drink bottles, along with soda and beer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s like Groundhog Day all over again,” Chris Phelps, state director of the advocacy group Environment Connecticut, told a<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.greenwichtime.com/middletown/article/Bottle-bill-drastically-scaled-back-13922712.php\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> local newspaper</a> shortly after the measure was defeated in the state legislature. “Every year when it comes to the bottle bill, every year, no progress is made, despite a lot of effort, a lot of work, a lot of recognition of the need to make progress.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Facing public pressure over its contribution to plastic pollution in the ocean and the problems with many municipal recycling systems, the beverage industry has released broad statements in recent weeks suggesting a new openness to bottle bills.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In response to questions from The New York Times about the industry’s lobbying efforts, the American Beverage Association said in an email that while it had opposed bottle bills “in the past,” it was “open to any ideas” that would create more recycled plastic. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This includes a deposit or fee on our containers,” the trade group said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The industry argues that bottle bills address only one source of plastic waste — soda and water bottles. Beverage companies and retailers say they want to increase recycling rates for all types of plastic, including yogurt containers and food pouches that would be excluded from deposit laws. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bottle bill supporters acknowledge that the systems have flaws, but blame retailers and bottlers for opposing attempts to modernize them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It gets to the larger question about recycling as a whole,” said Darryl Young, a former board member of the National Recycling Coalition. “Is it really just a way for manufacturers to avoid responsibility for their waste<!-- -->?<!-- -->”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Years ago, the National Recycling Coalition considered merging with Keep America Beautiful. Mr. Young said he voted down the deal partly because of concerns about the agenda of the group’s corporate donors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They want to help,” Mr. Young said, “but on their own terms.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Laura Turner Seydel, an environmental advocate and daughter of the media mogul Ted Turner, started a group called Atlanta Recycles in 2005 after learning about what seemed like an absurd conundrum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Recycling rates in Georgia were so low that local carpet manufacturers, a large user of recycled plastic, were forced to import the material from outside the state, even though Atlanta is home to the headquarters of Coca-Cola, one of the world’s largest producers of plastic bottles. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This winter, Ms. Seydel said, she witnessed why, 14 years after she founded Atlanta Recycles, little has changed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It exemplified why the wheels are coming off recycling,” she said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In January, some members of the group — made up of business leaders, government officials and environmentalists — were briefed on a $4 million investment that the Coca-Cola Foundation was making in the city. Coca-Cola, the group learned, had chosen Atlanta to showcase its “World Without Waste” campaign, which centered on increasing collection rates of bottles and cans.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The company, through a group called the Recycling Partnership, would pay for city workers to comb through residential recycling bins and leave behind “inspirational scorecards” marking which items could be recycled and which belonged in the trash. The program had been tested successfully on a smaller scale.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Someone in the meeting floated another idea: Why not explore the idea of a bottle bill in Georgia? </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The proposal was quickly shot down. Several members of the group expressed concern that pushing for a bottle bill could jeopardize the funding from Coca-Cola. The message, Ms. Seydel recalled, was “you better let that dog lie.” The discussion at the meeting grew heated. Ms. Seydel and others argued that bottle bills were proven methods to increase collection rates of used plastic. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Kanika Greenlee, the city’s environmental programs director, had come prepared with a statement from Coca-Cola, making clear its opposition to deposits. Bottle bills were inconvenient and costly, the company said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Greenlee, who through a spokeswoman declined to comment, holds several roles related to recycling in Atlanta. She works in the city’s public works department, but she also serves on the national board of directors of Keep America Beautiful alongside executives from Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, Pepsi and the American Chemistry Council, a trade group for chemical and plastics companies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A spokesman for Keep America Beautiful, which the packaging industry helped create in 1953 to combat litter, said the group had a “neutral” position on bottle bills and that “all options at this point need to be on the table” to improve recycling. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a statement, Coca-Cola said company policy positions were independent of its foundation’s donations, adding that the grant had already been awarded when the Atlanta Recycles meeting took place.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are open to exploring a variety of strategies to achieve our goal of recovering and recycling the equivalent of a bottle or can for every one we sell by 2030,” Coca-Cola said, adding that it found curbside recycling was “one of the most effective and convenient recycling solutions for consumers.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Empty bottles have vexed the beverage industry for more than a century. They are “the monstrous evil that saps the life from an otherwise prosperous trade,” The National Bottlers Gazette wrote in 1882.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Back then, beverage companies desperately wanted their bottles back because the glass containers were so expensive to make. The companies even conducted raids on homes to retrieve their used containers from housewives who used them to store ketchup and medicine. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the 1980s, however, mass-produced plastic made bottles inexpensive — and people rarely reused them. They often ended up being tossed on the side of the road, and the beverage companies simply made more of them. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bottle bills were passed partly in an effort to reduce this kind of litter. But states like Tennessee, New Jersey and Washington settled on an alternative. In Tennessee, beverage companies agreed to pay a small tax in order to fund litter pickup efforts, education programs and handouts promoting recycling.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There was another bonus. In many parts of the state, inmates would perform the daily litter cleanup, keeping costs low and rewarding good behavior in the county jails. The tax revenue pays for salaries and other expenses of county sheriffs overseeing the litter crews, like lunch from McDonald’s for the inmates.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It makes the time go easier,” one inmate, Miko Coleman, 29, said as he picked up trash along a quiet country road this spring.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the money — and the cleanup crews — would go away if Tennessee enacted a bottle bill, according to a provision in the law. That has made it difficult for bottle bills to gain traction politically.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I have to hand it to the industry, they have a superior strategy,” said Marge Davis, a writer and conservationist, who has been proposing a bottle bill in Tennessee nearly every year since 2004. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Davis says the litter pickup helps to beautify roads, but does not get at the core issue of recycling more bottles and cans. And even though her bottle bill proposal would find a new funding source for roadside cleanups, she has had a hard time convincing lawmakers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At times, Ms. Davis’ efforts faced another opponent — the group Keep Tennessee Beautiful. Like the work crews, Keep Tennessee Beautiful derives much of its funding from the tax money.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Keep Tennessee Beautiful’s organizational values, according to its website, include “personal responsibility” and “policy based on fact.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For several years, the group circulated research and spoke out against bottle bills. Their argument, presented in a two-page white paper in 2002, mirrored the beverage industry’s position closely. Stopping litter and encouraging recycling are best done through education, it said, not through 5-cent deposits.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Funds should go for prevention education,” the white paper states. “Teach the child and retrain the adult.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Missy Marshall, who has been executive director of Keep Tennessee Beautiful since 2013, said her group does not currently have an official position on deposits, but she worries about upending funding for a system that is successfully reducing litter.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What we don’t think is a positive step is to undo what we are doing,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the industry’s chief criticisms of bottle bills is that they deprive municipal recycling programs of valuable scrap material like aluminum cans. Selling this material helps offset the cost of processing items that are less valuable.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This argument has gained particular credence among environmental groups and municipalities after China put strict limits on the amount of plastic scraps that it imports from the United States. The policy shift in China led to a glut of used plastic and paper around the country, forcing some communities to burn or bury material they cannot offload. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Washington State, Sen. Christine Rolfes thought she had come up with a comprehensive solution. This winter, Ms. Rolfes introduced a bill that she said was intended to hold all plastic packaging manufacturers responsible for the recycling of not just plastic soda and water bottles, but also harder-to-process plastics like takeout containers and packaging wrap.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Representatives of roughly 20 companies and trade groups testified against the bill, including a group called the American Institute for Packaging and the Environment, whose members, according to its website, include ExxonMobil’s chemical division and Pepsico.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They pretty much represented the entire economy,” Ms. Rolfes said of the bill’s many opponents. “It was insidious.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After several revisions, the current version of the bill no longer holds plastic manufacturers responsible for recycling.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The bill, which has been signed into law, now directs a state agency to study different approaches to recycling plastic packaging. The report is due by October 2020. </p>',\n",

       " 'reimann-jab-nazi-keurig-krispy-kreme': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Emilie Landecker was 19 when she went to work for Benckiser, a German company that made industrial cleaning products and also took pride in cleansing its staff of non-Aryan elements.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was 1941. Ms. Landecker was half Jewish and terrified of deportation. Her new boss, Albert Reimann Jr., was an early disciple of Adolf Hitler and described himself as an “unconditional follower” of Nazi race theory.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Somehow, inexplicably, they fell in love.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The story of Ms. Landecker, whose Jewish father was murdered by the Nazis, and Mr. Reimann, whose fervent Nazism and abuse of forced laborers did not stop his family from attaining colossal wealth after the war, is a tale of death and devotion and human contradictions. It is also a tale of modern-day corporate atonement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Decades after World War II, Benckiser evolved into one of the largest consumer goods conglomerates on the planet. Known today as JAB Holding Company and still controlled by the Reimann family, it is worth more than $20 billion and owns Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Peet’s Coffee, Einstein Bros. Bagels, Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Pret A Manger, Keurig and other breakfast brands.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The relationship between Mr. Reimann and Ms. Landecker was for many years a secret. He was married, but had no children with his wife. He and Ms. Landecker had three, and he adopted them in the 1960s; today, two of them own a combined stake in JAB of about 45 percent. For decades, they say, they did not know about their father’s Nazism and the abuses that took place at the company they inherited: The female forced laborers who had to stand at attention outside their barracks naked. A prisoner of war who was kicked out of a bomb shelter and died.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Reimann and Ms. Landecker, who died in 1984 and 2017, respectively, never spoke about those years. Incriminating documents were destroyed or locked away in a safe. A two-volume company history glossed over the Nazi era in a handful of pages. But as Benckiser grew, morphing into the globe-spanning JAB, its past became impossible to ignore. Peter Harf, who joined the company in 1981 and became chairman this year, and whose own father was a Nazi, said he never really bought the idea that the organization had nothing to hide.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I knew the stories they told,” he said. “It didn’t smell right.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Around 2012, as JAB was acquiring high-profile coffee brands and drawing global attention, Mr. Harf pressed the family to open its archives to an independent scholar. By 2016, Paul Erker, an economic historian at the University of Munich, took on the task.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Only now, 74 years after World War II, are the family and the company grappling with their dark and complicated history. In March, the first findings about the abuse of forced laborers at the company leaked in a German tabloid. Discovering Nazi activity in corporate history is a somewhat regular occurrence in the country, and the crimes of the Reimanns were not as severe as, for example, those of the many larger companies with ties to death camps and the expropriation of Jewish businesses. But JAB’s portfolio of sunny coffee-and-doughnut brands in the United States made the revelations a global news story.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Its employees — there are 180,000 around the world — have reported that customers accuse them of “working for Nazis.” There have been boycott threats; this month, The Boston Globe published a scathing <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/food-dining/2019/06/04/peet-coffee-wake-call/XrJtIiY5MPYCycCGxglaSK/story.html?s_campaign=bostonglobe%3Asocialflow%3Afacebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR3DPrjcDynolmg7LB3gMZnD4yjMPdpfBT-YL4YVNjwElOT0J4ZMEK3S_kc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">article</a> with the headline: “I found out Nazi money is behind my favorite coffee. Should I keep drinking it?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The outrage has flared without the public knowing the full extent of Mr. Reimann’s Nazi convictions — and without knowing the final wrenching twist: that the history of the Reimann family is one of both victim and perpetrator. The heirs carry both sides within them. In a series of interviews with The New York Times, members of the Reimann family spoke publicly for the first time about the Nazi scandal. They disclosed the story of Emilie Landecker’s Jewish father, Alfred, and described how his murder has forced the clan to reckon not just with the past, but with the future.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Reimanns say they will spend some of their private fortune to honor Alfred Landecker’s memory. A one-time donation of 10 million euros (about $11.3 million) will go to institutions that help former forced laborers and their families. The Reimanns are also renaming their family foundation after him and doubling its budget to an annual €25 million, while ceding control of the board to an independent council. The foundation will fund projects that “honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and of Nazi terror,” and there are plans to fund at least one university chair in Germany in Mr. Landecker’s name.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.alfredlandecker.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">A new website for the Alfred Landecker Foundation</a> says its mission is to educate “about the Holocaust and the terrible price that is paid when intolerance and bigotry reign.” It continues, “The intention is to help strengthen our capacity to recognize the beginnings of such hatred and resist a repeat of such appalling events.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an interview, Mr. Harf noted that he lived in three places — New York, London and Milan — where nationalism and ethnic division were on the rise. For most of his long career, he said, he considered shareholder capitalism to be value neutral. No longer. In the age of Trump, Brexit and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/world/europe/italy-do-gooders-buonisti-matteo-salvini.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Matteo Salvini</a>, he said, businesses can no longer pretend that they are operating in a “value-free space.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is once again a time when everybody needs to take a stance,” Mr. Harf said. “I’m very scared of what’s happening.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In July 1937, Albert Reimann Jr. wrote a letter to Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS, who would later oversee the Holocaust.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are a purely Aryan family business that is over 100 years old,” wrote Mr. Reimann, then 39 and a senior executive in his father’s company. “The owners are unconditional followers of the race theory.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Reimanns had embraced National Socialism and anti-Semitism long before the Nazis came to power, according to an interim report by Mr. Erker, the historian. The younger Reimann heard Hitler speak in Munich in 1923 and became an early supporter. His father, Albert Reimann Sr., then the chief executive of Benckiser, heard him four years later in Mannheim, near the company’s southern German headquarters, and joined the Nazi party in 1931. His son followed a year later.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Around this time, the men gave the company a makeover in keeping with Nazi principles. By the time Hitler took over, Benckiser already housed a Nationalist Socialist Company Organization — a worker council that sought to uphold Nazi ideology. It later became a “model NS plant.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Reimann Sr. and Reimann Jr. were not just opportunistic followers of the regime,” Mr. Harf said. “They were fully signed up to the Nazi project.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Benckiser was then a medium-size industrial chemicals company, making products such as citric acids, a chemical to soften water, supplements for infant food and phosphates used in sausage making. In 1933, it employed 181 people. As an important supplier to the food industry, Benckiser benefited from the Nazi system, more than tripling sales over the next decade. Mr. Reimann Sr. served as president of the regional Chamber of Industry and Commerce, which helped orchestrate the Aryanization, expropriation and expulsion of Jewish businesses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Benckiser itself did not profit from businesses that had been taken from Jewish owners, and it never used concentration camp labor, as was common in bigger companies like Messerschmitt, a predecessor of Airbus, or IG Farben, which later split into companies including BASF and Bayer. But starting in late 1940, the Reimanns routinely took advantage of forced labor: men and women taken from their homes in Nazi-occupied territories, as well as prisoners of war, who were allocated by the Nazis to farms and industrial companies across Germany.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was around this time that Emilie Landecker started working in the accounting department as a clerk. Little is known about her time at the company during the war years, except that Mr. Reimann Jr. was now her boss. According to Mr. Harf, Benckiser’s use of forced laborers grew so fast that she would surely have been aware of the abuses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By 1943, 175 people, or a third of the total work force, were forced laborers, most of them from France and Eastern Europe. Benckiser operated two labor camps, one of them overseen by a brutal foreman, Paul Werneburg, who had been with the company since 1910. On his watch, female workers were forced to stand at attention naked outside their barracks, and those who refused risked sexual abuse. Workers were kicked and beaten, among them a Ukrainian woman who also cleaned in the Reimanns’ private villa.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">During a bomb raid on Jan. 7, 1945, Werneburg threw dozens of workers out of a camp bomb shelter. Thirty were injured, and one died. As word of Werneburg’s brutality spread, even the local Nazi office in charge of allocating forced laborers reprimanded the Reimanns for mistreating their workers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Landecker would have witnessed it all, said her son, Wolfgang Reimann, in an email. “She lived through the horror show happening in our own company,” he said. “She probably sat in the very bunker when Werneburg threw out the workers.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Reimanns’ enthusiasm for Nazi ideology never waned, Mr. Erker’s research shows. As late as February 1945, Mr. Reimann Jr. believed in the “Endsieg,” Hitler’s “final victory.” The war ended that May; a month later, he was arrested and interned by the Allied occupying powers as part of the de-Nazification process. Held in the A block in Camp 73 under prisoner number 2228, Mr. Reimann Jr. wrote a letter to the commanding officer on Sept. 22, dismissing allegations that he had been an “early and enthusiastic Nazi” as mere “denunciations” — and insisting that he was in fact a victim of the Nazis.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I may conclude that under the circumstances I am at a loss to understand the origin of the above mentioned allegation,” he wrote. “I am rather inclined to believe that I was myself closely surveyed by the Gestapo.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It worked. While the French initially barred Mr. Reimann Jr. from continuing his business activities, American officials overturned the judgment, classifying him as a “follower” of Nazism, rather than an active Nazi himself.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 1947, the wealth of the Reimann family totaled 686,000 Reichsmark, or approximately $2.4 million in today’s money. Over the decades, the fortune grew in step with Benckiser and its successor companies, and today the family’s worth is estimated at €33 billion. On one recent list of the wealthiest families in Germany, the Reimanns ranked second.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wolfgang Reimann said that the only thing his father ever told his children about the war was that the forced laborers had loved the company so much, they cried when the conflict ended and they had to leave.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He claimed that the French workers often got some red wine on Saturdays,” Wolfgang said, “and that transferees from other camps said that Benckiser was the best camp they had ever been in or heard of.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That’s nonsense, he said, cursing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Landecker was at work at Benckiser when the Gestapo came for her father.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was April 24, 1942. Around noon, two police officers arrived at the family apartment. Her younger brother, Wilhelm, who would later recollect the incident in an unpublished family memoir, opened the door.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Is the Jew Alfred Israel Landecker here?” one of the officers asked.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wilhelm led them to his father, who had been waiting. A letter had arrived that month, informing him of the date of his deportation. With Germanic precision, it had instructed him to pack one suit, some underwear and a coat with a yellow Star of David sewn to the front. No money or valuables were allowed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“So, you dirty Jew,” the officer said. “Are you ready to take a trip?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Alfred Landecker closed his suitcase and put on his coat. Then he hugged and kissed his son for the last time. “Willi, stay home so that no one associates my Star of David with you,” Mr. Landecker said, and then asked him to say goodbye to his sisters. “Give my love to Emmi and Gerdele. Behave, and obey God.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A few weeks later, one last letter arrived from Mr. Landecker, but only the envelope has survived. It shows that he was interned in block III 416/2 in Izbica, a ghetto serving as a transfer point for the deportation of Jews to the Belzec and Sobibor death camps in Nazi-occupied Poland.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Landecker, a World War I veteran and successful accountant, had been a loving father. After his wife, a Catholic, died in 1928, he looked after their three children by himself. Emilie, the eldest, was 6 at the time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Nazis took over in 1933. Two years later, the Nuremberg laws, which institutionalized the Nazis’ race theories, stripped Jews of their citizenship rights. Around that time, Mr. Landecker did two things that would prove prescient. He made sure his children were baptized Catholic, like his late wife. And he officially transferred to them his main possessions, including the family apartment, so that they could not be expropriated.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Mr. Landecker could not protect his family from an atmosphere that rapidly escalated from hostile to life-threatening — a shift he chronicled in a series of letters to his younger daughter, who was unwell and staying with his wife’s sister in the Bavarian countryside at the time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My dear child,” he wrote in December 1938, a month after Kristallnacht had seen synagogues and Jewish homes across Germany vandalized and burned. “The times have changed and with them the people.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We fought for five years only to have an age like this,” he wrote, referring to World War I. “I hope you, my dear children, remain well-behaved and good, and keep loving me, even if you suffer because of me.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Landecker was searching for a way to flee Germany — perhaps for the United States, where he had a brother and sister-in-law. “Aunt Pauline has written from America,” he wrote that December. “She is trying for us, maybe things will work out.” But there wasn’t enough money. Mr. Landecker was not allowed to work, which meant that Emilie, still a teenager, became the family’s only earner.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Mr. Landecker received his deportation notice in April 1942, the family made one last desperate attempt to stop it. They took a train to Berlin to the office in charge of Jewish affairs, where Mr. Landecker’s children showed officers their Catholic certificates. They were chased away.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Crying, we went back to the hotel, where our father was waiting,” Wilhelm Landecker wrote later. Despite the disappointment, their father got theater tickets for everyone that night in Berlin. A few days later, he wrote his last letter to Bavaria.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My dear Gerdele,” he wrote. “As you can see, I’m still here, but not for long. Today I learned that my departure is on the 24th of the month — in two days. So this is the last letter that you receive from me from here or perhaps ever. We don’t know what is waiting for us.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I wish you all the best for the future, stay healthy and become decent human beings,” he urged her. “If possible, I will write as soon as possible and hope that you won’t entirely forget me.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You won’t be able to marry here in Germany,” he continued. “Learn languages!! You have your future ahead of you — don’t waste it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“With this, my dear child, obey God, and please send my good wishes to everyone and be greeted by your Papa.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After her father was deported, Ms. Landecker continued working at Benckiser, becoming a trusted employee. When the war ended, Ms. Landecker would periodically bring Mr. Reimann Jr. papers to review in Heidelberg — making a perilous journey through bombed-out landscapes and an emergency bridge over the Rhine.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">No one knows when exactly their love affair started. But in 1951, their first child was born. Two more followed. Twice a week, every Sunday and Wednesday, Mr. Reimann Jr. would leave his wife and visit Ms. Landecker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She worked for Benckiser until 1965. That year, Mr. Reimann Jr. formally adopted their children. (His wife, Paula, had known of their relationship for some time.) The German authorities had long pressed Ms. Landecker for the name of her children’s father, and she had refused to give it away. But years later, she admitted in a letter to Mr. Reimann Jr. that she always missed not being his wife — and not having a regular family.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“And now I would like to also say something about our relationship,” Ms. Landecker wrote. “I think I need you much more than you need me, because I take up only a relatively small part of your life.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I am despite everything a woman,” she wrote. “You were and are the only person, to whom I can talk.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Today I know of course that it wasn’t a lack of willingness on your part, but I missed it nevertheless and I did not want to make demands that cannot be fulfilled under the given circumstances.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Landecker was a quiet woman. She did not speak much. But her children say that despite everything, she loved their father. “I never understood why,” said Wolfgang Reimann. “He was not very lovable from my perspective.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For decades, the children knew that their parents had met “at the company.” They knew that their maternal grandfather, Alfred, had been murdered by the Nazis. But until this year, they did not know that their father had been a fervent Nazi. When the children asked about the family’s Jewish roots, Wolfgang said, Ms. Landecker would speak evasively of growing up in a “Jewish milieu,” and then admonish her children to stop talking about “that old stuff.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My mother never said anything,” Wolfgang Reimann said. “For the longest time, I believed it was her personality.” But he has changed his mind. “If I had to live with the love of my life, as my mother did, and this person was also responsible for the terrible things that happened during the war, I would not have spoken much, either, I guess,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nearly every German company that has been around long enough has a story about the Nazi era. Many have been told. But many have not. Bahlsen, the cookie maker, commissioned a study on its war years only last month, after a young heiress flippantly played down the company’s use of forced labor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">International expansion has often been a trigger for German companies to reckon with their pasts. That was the case with the Reimanns’ properties. Over the years, Benckiser went through mergers and spinoffs; it combined with another firm to become the consumer-product giant Reckitt Benckiser, known for such brands as Lysol and Durex condoms, and eventually, the Reimanns channeled much of their wealth into <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.jabholco.com/#section-about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">JAB</a>. In recent years the holding company has spent billions to become a rival to the likes of Starbucks and Nestlé by buying chains including Panera Bread, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/10/business/krispy-kreme-bought-by-jab-holding-a-german-conglomerate.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Krispy Kreme</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/business/dealbook/pret-a-manger-jab-nestle.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Pret A Manger</a>. Last year, it also helped Keurig Green Mountain <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/business/dealbook/keurig-dr-pepper-snapple.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">buy Dr Pepper Snapple</a> for nearly $19 billion. JAB also controls the cosmetics giant Coty, the owner of Calvin Klein fragrances.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As scrutiny of the company grew, Mr. Harf urged the Reimann family to take the initiative and research its history — before someone else got there first.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Nazi revelations have stirred the youngest Reimanns. “When I heard and read of the atrocities committed at Benckiser, sanctioned by my grandfather, I felt like throwing up,” said Martin Reimann, 30, who is a grandchild to Ms. Landecker and Mr. Reimann Jr. “I cannot claim that I was very interested in politics before. I was just living my life. But after what happened, I changed my mind. I have to do something. In our family council, the younger generation created a little bit of a rebellion.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By renaming its foundation after Alfred Landecker, the Reimann family is bringing back one name from the millions killed by the Nazis. But it is also explicitly linking the memory of crimes past to today’s fight to preserve the values of liberal democracy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What we can learn from history and how we can learn from history is at the core of this foundation,” said Norbert Frei, the chairman of its academic advisory council. A respected German historian at Jena University, he has led investigations into the Nazi pasts of other companies, including Bertelsmann.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is not just about researching and remembering the past,” he added. “It’s about stabilizing and maintaining democracy today.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Harf, JAB’s chairman, agrees. He said he had recently read “The Order of the Day,” a historic novella by Éric Vuillard set in the years before World War II. One scene takes place in February 1933, when Hitler and the president of the Reichstag encourage 24 German industrialists to donate to the Nazi party. The businessmen — representing companies that are still prominent German corporate names, like Siemens, Bayer and Allianz — duly open their wallets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Harf said it made him think that not enough voices in business were speaking up against the re-emergence of nationalism and populism in Europe and the United States. Every time business leaders make decisions, he said, they should ask, “What does this mean for our children? What does it mean for the future?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In history, businesses have enabled populists,” he added. “We mustn’t make the same mistake today.” Then he quoted the Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal: “For evil to flourish, it only requires good men to do nothing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He added, “As the successors and descendants of people who committed horrendous acts, it is vital that our generation accepts what has happened, that we do whatever we can to bring tolerance and equality to the communities in which we live, and to ensure that the actions of Albert Reimann Sr. and Albert Reimann Jr. are a part of history which is never repeated.”</p>',\n",

She has interviewed Mr. Foster numerous times and broke the story of his candidacy. Mr. Robison would also have been present during the trip. But the campaign would not budge, she wrote. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After the article was published, Mr. Foster <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/RobertFoster4MS/status/1148791254513258496\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">responded on Twitter</a> that he and his wife had committed to following the Billy Graham rule before he announced his candidacy. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m sorry Ms. Campbell doesn’t share these views, but my decision was out of respect of my wife,” he wrote. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an email, Mr. Foster indicated he would grant Mississippi Today additional interviews, as long as they were conducted according to his rules. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We just want it to be in an appropriate and professional setting that wouldn’t provide opportunities for us to be alone,” he wrote.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The controversy has raised the freshman lawmaker’s profile, and his posts have garnered many supportive comments, along with criticism.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On social media and in interviews on Wednesday and Thursday, Mr. Foster criticized “the liberal press” and painted himself as an uncompromising man of principle. Mississippi Today <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://mississippitoday.org/2019/07/10/rep-foster-uses-ads-fundraising-call-to-stoke-firestorm-over-his-campaign-freezing-out-female-reporter/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">reported</a> that his campaign was boosting his social media posts and had sent out a fund-raising email asserting that he was being attacked for his Christian faith. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He and Ms. Campbell <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/11/politics/larrison-campbell-robert-foster-mississippi-cnntv/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twCNN&amp;amp;utm_content=2019-07-11T14:28:35\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">appeared on CNN’s morning show “New Day”</a> on Thursday.

Unless, at the end of day, what you’re saying here is, a woman is a sexual object first and a reporter second.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Foster is running to the right of his opponents and is considered a long shot to win the primary election on Aug. 6, <!-- -->Mississippi Today has written<!-- -->. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a phone interview on Wednesday, Ms. Campbell, who has <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/why-i-moved-to-jackson-mississippi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">written about</a> being married to a woman, said that Mississippi Today strives to do hard-hitting watchdog journalism and rebutted the notion that it is a liberal organization.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They’re trying to take something that is inherently sexist — not giving a female reporter the same access they would give a male reporter — and they’re trying to turn it into this liberal versus conservative thing,” she said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s just sexism, and that’s not a liberal or conservative issue.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She added that after posting her article on social media, she had heard from women around the country who were glad she had called attention to how politics is still seen as a largely male space. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here are answers to other questions you may have: </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Graham, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/obituaries/billy-graham-dead.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">who died last year</a> at 99, was the country’s best-known Christian evangelist. He sought to avoid any situation involving a woman other than his wife “that would have even the appearance of compromise or suspicion,” he wrote in his autobiography.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More recently, the practice has been referred to as “the Mike Pence rule.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/karen-pence-is-the-vice-presidents-prayer-warrior-gut-check-and-shield/2017/03/28/3d7a26ce-0a01-11e7-8884-96e6a6713f4b_story.html?utm_term=.52527d1d8ecf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">A 2017 Washington Post profile</a> drew attention to a statement he made in 2002 that he would not eat alone with any woman other than his wife, or attend an event where alcohol was served without her. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While many have criticized the practice as sexist, the attitude behind it is common among Americans: <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/01/upshot/members-of-the-opposite-sex-at-work-gender-study.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">A 2017 poll conducted by Morning Consult</a> for The New York Times found that many men and women are wary of a range of one-on-one situations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Around a quarter said that private work meetings with colleagues of the opposite sex are inappropriate, while nearly two-thirds believed that extra caution should be taken around members of the opposite sex at work, the poll found. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And a majority of women — and nearly half of men — said it was unacceptable to have dinner or drinks alone with someone of the opposite sex other than their spouse.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Republican primary has drawn high interest from Mississippi readers, and political observers believe Mr. Foster could force a runoff vote, said R.L. Nave, the editor of Mississippi Today, a three-year-old nonprofit site that seeks to provide information on government and politics in the state. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Foster’s primary opponents are Bill Waller, a former State Supreme Court chief justice, and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, both of whom agreed to let another reporter for the site, who happens to be male, shadow them. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Nave said his organization decided to publish Ms. Campbell’s account of her interaction with the campaign in order to be transparent with readers. He still hopes that the Foster campaign will allow greater access. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Our women reporters are exposed to a lot of very sexist behavior by the men that they cover,” Mr. Nave said. “But this is the first time in the three years we’ve been in existence, and the first time in my 15-year career in journalism, that we’ve had this experience with a political candidate. And so for that reason, we thought it was news.” </p>',\n",

Instead<!-- --> Bautista, seeded No. 23, will keep company with the Big Three of men’s tennis on Friday, meeting Novak Djokovic, the defending champion, in one semifinal, with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal facing off in the other.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It feels better to be in London,” Bautista said, noting that he expected his friends to be there, too, moving the party to the site of Friday’s match.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Federer, Djokovic and Nadal have a combined 53 Grand Slam singles titles; Bautista will be in his first Grand Slam semifinal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He beat Pella, the 26th seed and another dedicated baseliner, in a groundstroke battle that reflected how much the grass surface at Wimbledon has slowed since the days when the serve-and-volley ruled. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Their quarterfinal was <!-- --> largely devoid of aggressive forward thrust or stunning points, filled instead with steady, grinding rallies between competitors who mirrored each other in guts and played as if they had a phobia about the net.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bautista <!-- -->and Pella entered the quarterfinals with great confidence. Bautista<!-- --> had not lost a set in the tournament, and he said he was feeling the fruits of the many years he had toiled to improve his game.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> “My shots are really, really low,” he said of his playing style, how the low bouncing balls he typically hits are well suited to Wimbledon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pella, a 29-year-old from Argentina, reached his first Grand Slam quarterfinal by defeating the 2018 Wimbledon finalist Kevin Anderson in the third round and the 2016 finalist Milos Raonic in the next. Those two are among the most forceful players on tour, always looking to come to the net and clip off winning volleys. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In days gone by — the days of slick, quick Wimbledon grass — a middle-ranked groundstroker like Pella would have had little chance of posting back-to-back wins over such aggressive players.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the courts used in professional tennis have lost much of their variation over the last decade or so. These days Melbourne plays pretty much the same as Miami, which plays similarly to the courts in Doha and Stockholm. Even with its relatively distinctive surface, Wimbledon is not immune.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s much slower,” Pella said of the grass at Wimbledon. “I think the matches are more playable than in other years. You can play from the baseline without any problem. It was much easier for us to move, to play like a clay court.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Case in point: While Bautista dictated play Wednesday with his hard, flat, metronomic groundstrokes, only rarely did he move forward. In a match that featured 273 total points, he ended up at the net only 26 times, usually when forced by a mis-hit or drop shot. That’s an expected stat line on the red clay at the French Open, not here.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Baseline players have won Wimbledon, but each of them — from Bjorn Borg to Chris Evert to Nadal — has looked to press forward and end points faster than Bautista did. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nadal didn’t end up at the net very often either in his quarterfinal win over Sam Querrey on Wednesday, but he pressed the action forward, engaging in only seven rallies of nine or more shots. By contrast Bautista and Pella played 39 such rallies, many lasting far longer than nine shots.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Talk of playing style is one thing. At this point, all that really matters is winning, and Djokovic sounded extremely confident Wednesday after beating David Goffin, 6-4, 6-0, 6-2, on Centre Court.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’ve been playing my best tennis in this tournament in the last two rounds, fourth round and today,” said Djokovic, whose match lasted just under two hours. “I felt like I managed to dismantle his game.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Heading into Friday’s match, Bautista can lean on the fact that he has <!-- --> two wins over Djokovic in 2019.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">However the first, in Doha, Qatar, came in early January, just after the winter break. And the second, in Miami, came as Djokovic was dealing with burnout after winning the Australian Open.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Pella was asked what he would say if he were coaching Bautista for the semifinal. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Be more aggressive, he said, and keep Djokovic’s pounding service returns at bay.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And this: “He cannot miss a single ball.”</p>',\n",

Below are edited excerpts from our conversation. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before we even start looking, we spend a lot of time looking at articles and books. What are the types of features that you might find in this area? And then we start testing different algorithms, or different remote sensing processing techniques.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s kind of like a detective investigation, right? We’re looking at what techniques, what satellites, what processing methods work — 999 times out of 1,000, you fail miserably, because welcome to science. But you have those one or two things that may be a hint of something. And you just keep noodling at it until you figure out what works.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yeah, so I was actually known as “that satellite girl,” which is problematic on so many levels.<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong>But<strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"> </strong>there was a cohort of us in the early 2000s that really started applying the technology on a much larger scale. I think the work that I and many of my colleagues did helped to open a lot of people’s eyes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I gave a talk at a big archaeology conference about 10 years ago, and this creaky, elderly professor from Harvard, a very eminent scholar, came up to me. I thought, “Oh no, he’s going to say something.” He goes, “When I get home, I’m going to do a Google.” Like, he was going to check out Google Earth and look at his sites. I’m like, yes!</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So yeah, it’s been a battle. But I think we’re there.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When you look at what books are in the archaeology section of a bookstore, it’s mostly these pseudo-archaeological books by people who write that aliens built pyramids or other outlandish theories. And that’s not what archaeology is.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Archaeology is this incredibly rich field that helps to show the full trajectory of our humanity, all the good and all the bad, all our creativity, all of our foibles, the fact that our common humanity hasn’t evolved in 300,000 years — while our technology has. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That’s really why I wanted to write this book. I wanted to show how archaeology really works, and what we actually do with the evidence we have, and how all these amazing new technologies are helping us to ask new, bigger and better questions about the past.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There are two different strands. On the one hand, you have something like a PBS “Nova” special, which is beautifully shot and carefully researched. Keep doing those. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And then you have “Ancient Aliens,” on the History Channel. If you look at<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2018/10/16/paranormal-america-2018/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> a survey that was done by Chapman University</a>, we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of people in the U.S. who believe that ancient aliens built or had an influence on ancient cultures.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I watch these shows because I want to be educated, and you have engage with these people to try to change minds. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This is about 4,200 years ago. Egypt relied on the flooding of the Nile every year. If you have a consistent pattern of years and years and years of poor floods, that’s going to cause a drought. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">You also have this king, Pepi II, who ruled for about 90 years. And you had a weakening economy. So you had political instability, economic insecurity — and obviously the drought as well — causing social instability. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As a result of this, you had no foreign expeditions, you had no more pyramid building. You have this massive drop in the quality of the art. It’s like no one was going to college to learn how to draw anymore. It was definitely at least a generation, if not two, before things started to get better.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s real familiar. Yeah.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If somehow we can figure out how to make economic opportunity more equitable, we’ve got a chance of getting through this. And that’s certainly the lesson that the end of the Old Kingdom teaches us. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">You obviously had massive power, massive wealth focused in the hands of the king and his court. There was a very clearly defined lower class that wouldn’t have had, say, opportunities to get money to have nice burials — that’s really how we look at economic differences in the archaeological record.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But as the money toward the end of the Old Kingdom flowed to the provinces, there was more economic and artistic social independence. More people had more access to more opportunities. And that’s when you really see the developing of more regional art styles in Egypt, as well. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So yeah, I think there’s a big lesson for us. More economic opportunities in more regional areas could lead to flourishing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We’re not far away from satellite imagery that has a resolution of three inches. Imagine being able to zoom in from space and see a shard of pottery — we’re really close to that.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The other thing is that the field is shifting from satellite to drones. We’re not quite there yet, but within a couple years, we’re going to be able to capture very high resolution hyperspectral data, and laser mapping from autonomous vehicles, and that is going to transform the field as much as satellite imagery has.</p>',\n",

       " 'serena-williams-andy-murray-mixed-doubles': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">WIMBLEDON, England — After two wins together, the mixed dream team doubles pairing of Serena Williams and Andy Murray was knocked out in the third round of Wimbledon on Wednesday, falling to the top-seeded team of Nicole Melichar and Bruno Soares, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The addition of the singles stars brought exponentially more attention to the normally overlooked mixed doubles competition — so much more that Soares said he had to remind himself to keep the stakes in mind as they played before a packed crowd on No. 2 Court.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s such a different atmosphere for a third-round mixed match that it’s actually strange, everything that’s going on,” Soares said. “At the end of the day, it’s a third-round mixed doubles match, so if you overthink the situation, it might get too complicated.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Soares was able to dominate the match at the net, ensuring an end to a partnership that had captured the hearts and imaginations of fans at Wimbledon during their brief run.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For Williams, who has won seven singles titles at Wimbledon and another six in women’s doubles, the relatively brief run with Murray, a Scot with two Wimbledon championships of his own, was something to savor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“To play on this stage with Andy, who has done so well here for so many years, is literally just a lifetime experience,” said Williams, who will play a singles semifinals on Thursday. “I’m so happy that I got to experience it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was an experience that came about from unusual circumstances. Murray, who had hip surgery in January, is working himself back into shape by playing doubles. Williams, who had been slowed by knee pain for months, was also short on match play coming into Wimbledon. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When stars play mixed doubles, they can create tantalizing matchups, like in the Hopman Cup in January, when Williams, the top woman of the Open era in Grand Slam singles titles, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/sports/serena-williams-roger-federer.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">played against Roger Federer</a>, the top man in Grand Slam singles titles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But opportunities for such cross pollination between the tours are exceedingly rare. Mixed doubles is played only at the Grand Slam events and the Olympics as well as in the summer World Team Tennis league. It is not a part of the program at any of the 14 combined ATP-WTA tournaments, or at the N.C.A.A. championships.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That lack of growth in mixed tennis events runs counter to wider trends. Sports from swimming to luge have created more mixed-gender events in recent years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’d love to see more mixed; it could be great for the sport,” Soares said. “Everyone talks about equal rights and all those things we discuss these days; I think bringing men and women together on the court is something special for today’s world.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Melichar, who won the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon last year, said she thought headline-worthy tandems might continue to emerge if given the opportunity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Mixed doubles is such a special sport, and so much fun for us to play,” she said. “If they did expand it at more events, I think you’d see players like Serena and Andy — who normally don’t play doubles at Indian Wells or Miami — maybe they would play mixed, and it would be good for TV and for doubles.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Williams-Murray pairing was such a big deal that their first two matches were played on Centre Court. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Williams said she saw recreational mixed doubles being played frequently around her Florida home, but she sounded a more pessimistic note about fitting another competition into crowded tournament schedules.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The schedule is already so, so difficult,” she said. “It sounds good, it sounds really exciting, but the big question is: Will it work? Will one of the tournaments take a chance on it? Maybe. We’ll have to see. It’s all about trying; who knows if it will work or not?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One person willing to try is Mark Ein, the longtime owner the Washington Kastles, a World Team Tennis team, who recently bought the ATP-WTA tournament in Washington. Ein was not able to add a mixed doubles event in time for this year’s tournament, which begins on July 29, but remains optimistic for future editions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We would love to do a mixed event as part of the D.C. tournament, and we’re actively exploring it,” Ein said. “It just isn’t easy with the schedules, outside of the Grand Slams, to make it work when you have to fit all the matches in a week. Players are somewhat eager to move to the next tournament once they’re out<!-- -->.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ein cited the excitement over Williams and Murray, as well as the pairing of Venus Williams and Frances Tiafoe, as reason to invest in the format.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think when you look at how fans react to mixed doubles, they love watching it,” Ein said. “When you watch the players play it, you see true joy and love of the game. I think that translates to the fans. It just brings a different, very special element to an event.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">What is next for Murray is unclear. <!-- -->After suggesting in January that he may retire after Wimbledon, he says he is now pain free after a second hip surgery. He won the men’s doubles title with Feliciano López at Queen’s Club last month, but he lost in the second round at Wimbledon with Pierre-Hugues Herbert. On Wednesday, despite persistent questioning, Murray did not offer a timeline for his plans, not even committing to the United States Open in August. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Williams, who did three news conferences with Murray, got an up-close look at his relationship with British reporters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Andy gets asked every question about his body and the U.S. Open,” Williams said, smiling. “Literally every question in a different way, but it’s the same question.”</p>',\n",

       " 'skull-neanderthal-human-europe-greece': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A skull fragment found in the roof of a cave in southern Greece is the oldest fossil of Homo sapiens ever discovered in Europe, scientists reported on Wednesday. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Until now, the earliest remains of modern humans found on the Continent were less than 45,000 years old. The skull bone <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1376-z\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">is more than four times as old</a>, dating back over 210,000 years, researchers reported in the journal Nature. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The finding is likely to reshape the story of how humans spread into Europe, and may revise theories about the history of our species.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Homo sapiens evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. The new fossil bolsters an emerging view that our species migrated from Africa in several waves, beginning early in our history.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the first waves of migrants vanished. All humans who have ancestry outside of Africa today descended from a later migration, about 70,000 years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Katerina Harvati, lead author of the new study, said it’s impossible to say how long the earliest Europeans endured on the Continent, or why they disappeared.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a very good question, and I have no idea,” said Dr. Harvati, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany. “I mean, this is the first time that we’ve found them.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The skull first came to light in 1978, as anthropologists from the University of Athens School of Medicine explored a cave called Apidima, on the Peloponnese. They found fragments from a pair of skulls lodged in the roof of the cave.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The researchers freed a backpack-size rock containing the fossils, and then struggled for years to extract the bones.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the fossils, called Apidima 1, turned out to be part of the back of a skull. The other, Apidima 2, consisted of 66 fragments from an individual’s face.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">An early study of Apidima 2 suggested the fragments were about 160,000 years old, and so it seemed likely that Apidima 1 had fossilized around the same time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That age made the two fossils much older than the earliest known evidence of our species in Europe. It seemed more likely that the skulls belonged to Neanderthals, who arrived in Europe about 400,000 years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Museum of Anthropology at the University of Athens invited Dr. Harvati, an expert on the shapes of human skull fossils, to take a closer look. She and her colleagues performed CT scans on the remains and then analyzed them on a computer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the researchers virtually reassembled the face of Apidima 2, they realized they were looking at a Neanderthal. But when the team analyzed the back of Apidima 1’s skull, they knew that they were dealing with something different.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Neanderthals and other extinct human relatives, the back of the skull bulges outward. “It looks like when you put your hair up in a bun,” Dr. Harvati said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But in our own <!-- -->species,<!-- --> <!-- -->there is no bulge<!-- -->. Compared with our <!-- -->extinct <!-- -->cousins, the back of the modern human skull is distinctively round.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To Dr. Harvati’s surprise, so was the back of Apidima 1’s skull. It also had other features found in Homo sapiens but not in other species.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Laura Buck, a paleoanthropologist at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the study, said Dr. Harvati and her colleagues made a compelling case. “That very round shape is something we tend not to see in other groups,” Dr. Buck said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While Dr. Harvati and her colleagues were analyzing the fossils, Rainer Grün carried out a new study of their age. Dr. Grün, a geochronologist at Griffith University in Australia, analyzed tiny samples of rock retrieved from the two fossils.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Apidima 2, the Neanderthal, turned out to be 170,000 years old, just a bit older than the previous estimate. But Apidima 1, the Homo sapiens skull, was at least 210,000 years old — some 40,000 years older than Apidima 2.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That date makes the skull fragment the oldest modern human fossil not just in Europe, but anywhere outside Africa. The challenge scientists now face is to figure out how Apidima 1 fits into our ancient history.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over the past 20 years, researchers have amassed a great deal of evidence indicating that human populations that live outside Africa today all descended from small groups of migrants who departed the continent some 70,000 years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The journey <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/science/ancient-dna-human-history.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">is recorded in human DNA</a>, and archaeologists have documented it by tracking the spread of human remains and tools from Africa.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But in recent years, researchers have discovered a few fossils that don’t fit the narrative. Last year, for example, researchers <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/science/jawbone-fossil-israel.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">found a Homo sapiens jaw in Israel that is 180,000 years old</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another clue came to light in 2017, in bits of DNA preserved in Neanderthal fossils discovered in Europe. Some of the genetic material appeared to have been inherited from Homo sapiens, not Neanderthals. The scientists speculated that our species <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/04/science/neanderthals-dna-homo-sapiens-human-evolution.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">reached Europe at least 270,000 years ago and interbred with Neanderthals there</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Harvati said that Apidima 1 and the DNA evidence both point to an early expansion of Homo sapiens into Europe from Africa. “It’s eerie how well it all fits,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s possible that the fossils in Israel belong to the same wave of modern humans from Africa, or perhaps to a later one. In either case, it seems that all those people disappeared.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One speculation is that Neanderthals moved into Greece and Israel, and outcompeted the modern humans they encountered. If so, things went differently during the later migration 70,000 years ago.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That wave of humans may have thrived outside Africa because they brought better tools. “If there’s an overarching explanation, my guess would be a cultural process,” Dr. Harvati said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Greece may be a good place to test this idea. Southeast Europe may have served as a corridor for various kinds of humans moving into Europe, as well as a refuge when ice age glaciers covered the rest of the Continent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is a hypothesis that should be tested with data on the ground,” Dr. Harvati said. “And this is a really interesting place to be looking at.”</p>',\n",

       " 'soccer-parade': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There were words of gratitude, the usual forgettable verbiage from public officialdom and a presentation of the keys to the city. Then the people gathered at the City Hall rally for the United States women’s soccer team on Wednesday finally got to hear from the woman most of them were waiting for: Megan Rapinoe. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rapinoe did not disappoint. In a memorable speech, she lauded her teammates, spoke of the politics of division and equal pay and let forth a profane tribute to New York City. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is my charge to everyone: We have to be better, we have to love more and hate less. Listen more and talk less. It is our responsibility to make this world a better place,” Rapinoe told the crowd. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The ceremony came after the team rolled up Broadway, cheered by thousands and showered in confetti. The team, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/sports/soccer/usa-vs-netherlands-score.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">which defeated the Netherlands, 2-0</a>, on Sunday in the World Cup final in Lyon, France, traversed the Canyon of Heroes, a stretch of Broadway from Battery Park to City Hall.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rapinoe fed off the energy of the crowd as she celebrated her team with the most poignant words of the day. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This group is so resilient, is so tough, has such a sense of humor,” said Rapinoe, the top scorer at the Women’s World Cup in France, where the United States won its second straight title. “There’s nothing that can faze this group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We got pink hair and purple hair. We got tattoos and dreadlocks. We got white girls and black girls and everything in between. We got straight girls and gay girls.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bagpipers, motorcyclists and rows of police officers joined the floats of soccer stars in the parade. Mayor Bill de Blasio waved an American flag surrounded by members of the team, who wore “world champion” shirts and their medals. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Gov. Andrew Cuomo was on a separate players’ float, and he, Crystal Dunn, Tobin Heath and other players were seen chanting “equal pay.” The team’s players have objected that the American men’s team is paid more, though its performances have been significantly weaker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A poster on that float read: “Parades are cool; equal pay is cooler.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’ve got 22 of the best, bestest friends right behind me,” Carli Lloyd said at the City Hall ceremony. Her speech followed a lengthy drum performance, the national anthem, the presentation of colors, introductions by Robin Roberts, and speeches by the mayor; his wife, Chirlane McCray; and Carlos Cordeiro, the president of U.S. Soccer, who was serenaded by “equal pay” chants by many in the crowd.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/09/politics/megan-rapinoe-anderson-cooper-trump-cnntv/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">an interview on CNN</a> on Tuesday night, Rapinoe said she and her teammates wanted to celebrate their title in part by talking to leaders in Congress and elsewhere about the issues they’ve been vocal about throughout their run. She said she was not interested, however, in going to the White House, because she didn’t want President Trump to piggyback on their platform.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Your message is excluding people,” Rapinoe said when asked if she had a message for Trump. “You’re excluding me, you’re excluding people that look like me, you’re excluding Americans that maybe support you.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rapinoe said the “equal pay” chant from the crowd at the end of the final solidified the win as a transcendent moment. She said that beyond pay, the issue was about investing equally into the men’s and women’s games.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Until we have equal investment and care and thought and brainpower put on both sides, then we don’t know what our potential is. I mean right now I would say that we’re doing pretty good basically creating this entire business without being compensated substantially.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Canyon of Heroes has been used to celebrate many people and events, including the Apollo 11 astronauts and the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge. This is the second time the women’s national team has received the honor; the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/11/sports/soccer/us-team-loves-new-york-its-mutual.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">2015 squad</a> was also feted, a first for a women’s team.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> It has been a nonstop party for the team since their victory. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/USWNT/status/1147953126202150912\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Champagne </a>flowed in the locker room, and celebrations have continued in the streets of France, on planes and buses, and now back in the United States. Several players were seen swigging from Champagne bottles during the parade. </p>',\n",

       " 'south-korea-army-gay': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">SEOUL, South Korea — The army lieutenant knew his career was irrevocably damaged when military investigators visited him in 2017, demanding that he admit having had sex with another male soldier — a crime in South Korea’s military.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the investigators put him on a video call with his ex-lover, who admitted to the relationship, he felt he had to confess. Then they seized the lieutenant’s smartphone, pressing him to identify gay soldiers in his contact lists. And they humiliated him with questions like “What sex positions did you use?” and “Where did you ejaculate?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The lieutenant — who in an interview asked to be identified only by his surname, Kim — could have gone to prison, but his indictment was suspended because of his “contrition.” He chose to leave the army, though, believing that he no longer had a future there.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">South Korea’s military says it does not discriminate against sexual minorities. But Mr. Kim is one of an increasing number of gay or transgender soldiers who have been persecuted under Article 92-6 of the Army Criminal Act, which has been used to out them and punish them for consensual sex, Amnesty International said in a report released on Thursday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Under Article 92-6, “anal sex and other indecent acts” between military personnel can be punished by up to two years in prison, even if they take place off base, while the soldiers are off duty and by mutual consent. Repeated attempts by advocates for L.G.B.T. and intersex people to abolish the law have been unsuccessful.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“South Korea’s military must stop treating L.G.B.T.I. people as the enemy,” said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/roseann-rife/?originalSubdomain=hk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Roseann Rife</a>, East Asia research director at Amnesty International. The group’s report, “Serving in Silence,” also details sexual and other abuses inflicted on gay soldiers, or soldiers perceived as gay, by their superiors and their fellow soldiers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is long overdue for the military to acknowledge that a person’s sexual orientation is totally irrelevant to their ability to serve,” Ms. Rife said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The South Korean government says Article 92-6 is not meant to punish sexual orientation. Rather, it says, it is needed to deter sexual abuse in the army, which is almost entirely male. The country’s Constitutional Court has repeatedly ruled that the article is justified by the military’s need to preserve discipline and “combat power.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">South Korea, which technically has been <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/world/asia/korea-peace-deal.html?searchResultPosition=5&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">in a state of war with North Korea for decades</a>, has a conscript army of about 600,000 soldiers. All able-bodied South Korean men are required to serve for about two years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The military says it does not bar gay and transgender people from serving, and the Defense Ministry has expanded training on protecting the rights of sexual minorities. What is forbidden, the army says, is not sexual identity, but what the law calls “indecent” sexual activity.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Enforcement of Article 92-6 has been on the rise. The number of soldiers charged under it went from two per year in 2009 and 2010 to 14 in 2012, then 28 in 2017. Ten soldiers were charged in the first half of 2018, the most recent period for which data was available.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Military veterans have long reported discrimination against homosexuals in the army, as well as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/world/asia/outrage-builds-in-south-korea-over-military-abuse.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">more widespread abuses</a> like beatings, hazing and bullying. Most gay soldiers have hidden their sexual orientation for fear of being outed and harassed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2017, the year Mr. Kim was interrogated, the army <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/world/asia/south-korea-mlitary-anti-gay-campaign.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">launched a particularly aggressive crackdown</a> based on Article 92-6, confiscating soldiers’ cellphones without warrants and forcing them to identify other soldiers with whom they’d had sex, according to the Military Human Rights Center, a civic group based in Seoul, the capital.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Nine active-duty soldiers were indicted, of whom eight were convicted, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/world/asia/south-korea-gay-soldier-military-court.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">including a captain who received a suspended prison term</a>. Several of the cases are being appealed, and none of the soldiers have been sent to prison, according to Lim Tae-hoon, director of the Military Human Rights Center of Korea, which provides legal assistance for the soldiers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Fourteen other soldiers were investigated but not indicted — some of whom, including Mr. Kim, have petitioned the Constitutional Court to rule Article 92-6 unconstitutional, Mr. Lim said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In South Korea, which has been slow to embrace the rights of sexual minorities, that 2017 crackdown triggered an unusual degree of outrage.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In recent years, gay people have become more visible in the country. But conservative Christian groups have also escalated demonstrations against homosexuality in major cities, often calling gay soldiers a threat to military readiness.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those groups helped to scuttle attempts in Parliament to pass an anti-discrimination law, urged on South Korea by the United Nations, that would give sexual minorities the same protections that other minority groups have.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Amnesty International’s report describes in vivid detail how antigay attitudes have translated into physical and sexual abuse within the military.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One former soldier told the rights group he had been forced to have oral and anal sex with another gay soldier, as a superior taunted, “Don’t you want to have sex with a womanlike man?” Others have been sexually abused for “not being masculine enough,” walking in an “effeminate” way or having a high-pitched voice, according to the report.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Amnesty said it interviewed 21 former, current and future soldiers for the report, most of whom used pseudonyms, including Mr. Kim. One of them, Jeram Yunghun Kang, agreed to the use of his full name in an interview with The New York Times.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Kang, who joined the army in 2008, said other soldiers in his unit harassed him by groping him, kissing his neck and pulling down his underwear. After he confided to an officer that he was gay and asked for help, his battalion commander outed him in front of his entire unit, asking him, “Who did you seduce last night?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">From that day on, Mr. Kang said, he had to wear a “smiley face” pin on his chest, marking him as a “soldier of special interest.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I had to take showers alone,” Mr. Kang said by telephone from London. “I was considered dirty, someone neither male nor female who should not be naked in the presence of other men.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Kang was eventually sent to a military psychiatric ward, where he was forced to take antidepressants twice a day. Staffers there advised him to pretend to be insane so he could be ruled unfit for service and expelled from the military.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Kang refused. Instead, he said, he attempted suicide twice. He was put in solitary confinement, his limbs tied to a bed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“While I was tied there in a room where there was no sound or light allowed in, I felt that there was nowhere for me to run in South Korea,” he said. After 116 days in a hospital, he was expelled from the military in 2009 for psychiatric reasons.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Kang’s mother, who raised him alone, sold her house so he could go to London, to live and study in a more accepting environment. Since moving there in 2016, he has drawn on his experience in the military to create installation art and a self-published book.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Now, his student visa about to expire, Mr. Kang is afraid to come home.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I left South Korea as if I were fleeing,” he said. “I dread going back there. I feel like I am a refugee.”</p>',\n",

       " 'southern-california-orange-grove': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">LOS ANGELES — Drive through the San Fernando Valley and it is easy to spot the hallmarks of suburban Southern California: streets lined with palm trees, carefully sheared hedges and red-tiled roofs, a blur of tidy development.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But turn a corner in one neighborhood and a 12-acre orange grove comes brightly into view.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bothwell Ranch is one of the last remaining orange groves in the San Fernando Valley, a vestige of the long-evaporated citrus industry. The grove, with its tightly packed rows of orange trees, calls to mind another time, before relentless development transformed this rural agricultural area into endless sprawl.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The ranch is at the center of a growing dispute between its owners, who have <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2019/06/28/end-of-an-era-the-san-fernando-valleys-last-commercial-orange-grove-is-up-for-sale/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">sought to sell it</a> to luxury housing developers, and community members who believe it should remain an orchard. The Los Angeles City Council is currently considering a proposal to give the site a historic designation to preserve at least part of the orchard. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whether or not the family sells the property is still to be seen. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“At this point, they’re just trying to figure out what to do because there has been so much interest,” said Ciara Trujillo, a senior vice president with the real estate firm Colliers International. A lawyer representing the family did not respond to a request for comment. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[Sign up for our daily newsletter on California </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline\" title=\"\">here</a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But for many, regardless of the family’s decision, the orchard has become a symbol of the ways that development in Los Angeles County has run amok. Decades of population growth, rising property values and the spread of single-family homes have transformed the landscape. At the same time, the shortage of affordable housing in the region has intensified questions about where to build and how to retain the character of neighborhoods as they grow.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Critics of the Bothwell Ranch sale have largely appealed to nostalgia, which has resonated with longtime valley residents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Paul Ayers, a lawyer and amateur archivist who grew up in the valley, said he worries that the region’s rural history may be forgotten. He recalled the transformation of the area since the mid-20th century, when manufacturing took off and groves were razed in favor of houses, pushing the citrus industry north. His father worked in citrus, and he has studied how the industry declined because of the joint pressures of rising land prices and corresponding spikes in property taxes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For many families living on San Fernando Valley farmlands, Mr. Ayers said, selling to developers and moving to cheaper, more agriculturally prosperous regions like Tulare County, where more than 40 percent of citrus fruits are now produced, just made sense.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“California was built on the ideal of Spanish-themed orange groves under the moon,” he said. “That’s how it was sold. That brought a lot of people to California.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There’s nostalgia, there’s regret about what has happened to Los Angeles with the uncontrolled growth,” he added. “People can only hold on to that image as long as there’s something out there to hold on to.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Councilman Bob Blumenfield, who represents the San Fernando Valley, last week put forward a motion to designate the ranch a historic monument. Though the ranch is private property, the motion immediately puts a halt on any potential demolition permits, he said, and may discourage buyers who are wary of dealing with a property that has historic designation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The goal of the motion, Mr. Blumenfield said, was to slow the process down “so that other uses that are more compatible with our history and community can be considered.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is the last bit of our agricultural history in the San Fernando Valley and it could potentially be lost forever,” he added. “It was a 100-acre ranch and these are just the last 13 acres of it, the last vestige. Everything else has been turned into housing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Orange groves covered 41,000 acres of Los Angeles County in 1950, when it was the most prosperous agricultural county in America, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. Now, just 76 acres of orange groves remain, even as the state remains responsible for more than a third of America’s oranges. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There are more orange trees in backyards than in commercial operations” in the valley, said Casey Creamer, president of California Citrus Mutual, an advocacy group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Land values for development are far more lucrative than commercial farming operations in Southern California,” Mr. Creamer said. “The need for housing in these population centers far outweighs any sort of revenue stream you can get out of farming in California.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Bothwell family took over the orchard in the 1920s when Lindley Bothwell, a cheerleading coach at the University of Southern California and a vintage car collector, bought the ranch. When Mr. Bothwell <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-06-21-mn-19671-story.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">died in 1986</a>, his wife, Helen Ann Bothwell, managed the ranch until her death in 2016. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It brings me up short when I think of it every once in a while, that it’s the last of its kind,” Ms. Bothwell <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1998-aug-30-me-17982-story.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">said in 1998</a>. “But somebody has to be first, and somebody has to be last.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the Bothwells began managing the grove in the 1920s, there were fewer than 75,000 people living in the valley. The population grew rapidly over the next few decades, transforming the region, which now is home to more than 1.85 million people.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lou Ann Cowsill grew up in nearby Chatsworth and recalled getting lost among one grove’s silky leaves when she took a wrong turn walking home from her first day of elementary school.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Years later, she watched the groves get cut down for housing, again and again.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It happened so quickly in the ’60s. It’s sad,” said Ms. Cowsill, 64, a pharmacy technician who now lives on a hay farm in Oregon. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Los Angeles County today has a severe housing shortage, in part fueled by a resistance to building more, cheaper homes. But development on the Bothwell property — which is nestled between the Woodland Hills and Tarzana neighborhoods — would most likely not have much of an effect on access to affordable housing. The homes that border the property reach easily into seven-figures and feature expansive grounds, outdoor pools and tennis courts, according to property records and satellite images.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Todd Pratt, a manager partner at Evolution Strategic, a Los Angeles development company, said: “It’s completely unfeasible today to expect it to remain as a viable farmed property when you have tons and tons of acres of farmland available a very short distance away.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Pratt, whose company primarily works on developing large, mixed-use buildings, added, “The city needs to grow and evolve. There is no reason that should be retained as a historic farm. Maybe you keep a half-acre with some orange groves on it as a small park, but the rest of it should be developed.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For now, the historic designation is uncertain, though Mr. Blumenfield says he is confident his colleagues on the City Council will cooperate. He noted the council’s powers are limited when it comes to deciding the future of the ranch, but said the designation would at least give the city leverage to request some of the grove be preserved and perhaps opened to the public for educational and historical purposes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’re often looking at situations where we’re saving the last of the Art Deco houses, the last of this, the last of that,” he said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Jeff Ward is the fourth-generation owner of E. Waldo Ward &amp; Son, a shop that sells jams and marmalades in Sierra Madre, 30 miles east of Bothwell Ranch. Long before Mr. Ward took over the store, the family citrus farm was about 30 acres, but it’s now less than a tenth the size, only about an acre of which is made up of oranges.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Ward says he’s seen too many nearby groves turn from branches to buildings.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Things change,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-jwz2nf etfikam0\">Jose A.

       " 'stalin-museum-georgia-russia': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">GORI, Georgia — Here are just a few of the fun facts that visitors learn during a guided tour of the Stalin Museum in Gori, the small Georgian town where the former Soviet leader was born.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Joseph Stalin was a good singer. He wrote poems. During his reign, 9,000 state enterprises were started. One of his granddaughters now runs a shop in Portland, Ore. Among the gifts offered to Stalin by adoring citizens was a luxurious fur coat, which now hangs inside a glass case in a room filled with tributes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That fur coat was presented to Stalin by a Moscow clothing company,” said the tour guide, an elderly woman with a thick Georgian accent and hair dyed with purple highlights. “But Stalin did not wear it. Not his style.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dedicated in 1957, four years after Stalin’s death, the museum has an austere exterior in the Socialist Classical style and an interior stuffed with paintings, photographs and personal mementos. To the left of the entrance sits a rail car, the one Stalin rode to the Potsdam Conference in Germany in the summer of 1945, its curtains intact, its bulletproof glass long ago replaced.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The tone throughout the museum is admiring, a stirring narrative about a poor kid who, against long odds and despite numerous stints in czarist prisons, soared to the heights of power. The floors have red carpets. Stalin’s death mask rests on a marble stand, like a beloved leader, lying in state.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sandwiched between Russia and Turkey, Georgia is a small country with celebrated cuisine, gorgeous landscapes — and a scarcity of world-renowned tourist attractions. One of the few it does have, unfortunately, is the man born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili, the son of a cobbler who became one of humanity’s greatest criminals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This has presented a quandary for Georgian officials. How, if at all, does a country market a homegrown monster to the rest of the world?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Part of the answer may lie in what is missing from the tour. There is no reference to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/books/review/never-remember-masha-gessen-misha-friedman.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the gulag</a>, the system of slave camps and prisons that claimed more than one million lives. Nor is there a peep about the Great Terror, Stalin’s <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/20/world/europe/moscow-stalin-victims.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">campaign of purges and executions</a> in the 1930s.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">50 MILES</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">russia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">Abkhazia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">S.<span class=\"g-cstyle0\"> </span>Ossetia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">Black</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">Sea</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">Georgia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">Tbilisi</p><p class=\"g-pstyle7\">Gori</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">turkey</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">Azer.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">Armenia</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A fleeting reference is made to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/24/world/europe/ukraine-holodomor-famine-memorial.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">the collectivization of Soviet farms</a>, which led to the starvation of an estimated four million Ukrainians, but if you’d never heard of this atrocity, you might think it was a hard-won success marred by slip-ups.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Many mistakes were made in the Soviet Union during the collectivization,” the guide said, striding briskly from one display to another. “But nevertheless, collective farms were created.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Georgia’s struggle about what to do with Stalin and his legacy has occasionally produced wince-inducing solutions. In 2013, the chief of the National Tourism Administration, Giorgi Sigua, suggested that the country could appeal to the Chinese “just like” Israel has long catered to Christians.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We can sell Stalin as a tourist product to the Chinese market,” Mr. Sigua said in a public statement. “Just like the Jews are selling Jesus Christ.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Sigua was fired in 2014.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although Georgia abandoned its state-backed pitch for Stalin-based tourism, he remains a major draw, particularly among Chinese and Russians. Roughly 162,000 people visited the Stalin Museum last year, according to Taia Chubinidze, who sat behind a counter at the tourist center in Gori one recent afternoon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That’s more than any museum in the country,” she said, beaming.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was not possible to check this assertion because officials with the tourism administration refused to answer a single question about Stalin-related tourism.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The sensitivity is understandable.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Stalin inspires deep emotions in the country where he spent his earliest years, and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/world/europe/01stalin.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">one of them is reverence</a>. This is especially true in Gori, where many people, especially older ones, regard him as a epochal figure who built an empire and beat the Nazis in World War II.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He was a simple man who grew up and became the leader of a great country,” said Mera B’chatadze, a 70-year-old retired construction worker, who was sitting on a park bench adjacent to the Stalin Museum.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He was a genius,” added a friend, Givi Lursmanashivi.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To many younger Georgians, pro-Stalin views like these are both blinkered and disturbing. Never very sentimental about his native land, Stalin victimized this country for decades. More than 400,000 Georgians were deported, a majority of them shot.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It seems likely that in the terrors of the ’30s, more Georgians were executed, in proportion to the country’s size, than in any other republic,” said the historian Simon Sebag Montefiore, the author of “Young Stalin.” “Probably due to Stalin’s intimacy with Georgian leaders.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Decades after Soviet rule was shaken off, Russia retains an ominous presence here. In 2008, Gori was one of the towns Russia bombed and occupied during<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/24/world/europe/in-russias-frozen-zone-a-creeping-border-with-georgia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> a short and disastrous war</a> that left 20 percent of the country — though not Gori — in Russia’s hands.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Many of the locals here don’t seem to care. It helps that Stalin brings in plenty of lari, the Georgian currency.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Across the street from the entrance to the museum is a collection of souvenir shops, selling a wide assortment of Stalin-themed tchotchkes — decorative plates, coffee mugs, miniature busts, tote bags, paperweights, pens, shot glasses, pipes, lighters, flasks and the list goes on.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">More important than the financial upside, there is also a widespread sense here that, all evidence to the contrary, Stalin was only pretending to be a communist. Secretly, he was a Georgian nationalist.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“A lot of people we talk to say that he kept a cross in his apartment, which meant that he was a Christian,” said Nutsa Batiashvili, an associate professor at the Free University of Tbilisi, who has written about the role of Stalin in Georgian memory.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They say he made Georgian cuisine very important in the Kremlin, and made Georgian toasting part of the etiquette there,” she added. “I know how weird all this sounds because no one can pinpoint anything that Stalin did which actually benefited Georgia.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Unless one counts the international notoriety Stalin has brought to Gori. The town’s fondness for him has occasionally made headlines.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2010, the government <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/world/europe/26georgia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">removed an imposing statue of Stalin </a>that had long stood at the center of town, on Stalin Avenue. This past May, as the country marked the 74th anniversary of victory in World War II, a group of activists demanded the statue’s return to its place of pride.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That demand was ignored.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Likewise, Gori has essentially ignored government demands to tone down the hagiographic glow emitted by the museum. In 2012, the minister of culture announced that the exhibits would be transformed in ways that honored the tyrant’s victims. Once completed, the minister said, the changes would provide the “objective truth” about Stalinism.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The overhaul never occurred. Instead, the museum added a room containing a table where confessions were wrung from arrestees, along with a reproduction of a prison cell.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s a modest, halfhearted add-on and, more to the point, the tour skips it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A group of European tourists missed the room entirely, and after the purple-haired guide ended her patter (“Thank you for your visit. I wish you luck.”), all of them seemed stupefied and faintly amused.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He’s a hero here!” said an exasperated Jochen Dieckmann, a German who was shaking his head in disbelief. “They have very famous writers in Georgia, that everyone is very proud of. They don’t seem to understand that Stalin sent them to the gulag and killed them all.”</p>',\n",

Good news makes investors nervous. Welcome to Wall Street.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/business/sp-3000.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">S&amp;P 500</a> rose above 3,000 for the first time in its history on Wednesday, with gains that continued early Thursday. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The most recent jump began after Federal Reserve chair, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/business/economy/jerome-powell-rate-cut.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Jerome Powell</a>, suggested the nation’s central bank was worried about the economy. Just days earlier, strong data on the job market had the opposite effect for stocks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This counterintuitive reaction to the news is a phenomenon that’s explained by expectations for interest rates. The weakening outlook for the economy means, in all likelihood, borrowing costs are coming down —\\xa0and in the right circumstances, this can be good for stocks. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If that all sounds familiar, there is good reason. Those same conditions were in place for much of 2012 to 2015, when the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 45 percent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That climb earned itself a nickname, the TINA market. It stands for There Is No Alternative, which simply means that because central banks around the world were holding rates so low investors had little choice but to buy American stocks. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lower interest rates made returns on government bonds around the world less appealing and drove investors to seek returns in the stock market. <!-- -->At the same time, the United States economy was performing better than much of the rest of the world, and American stocks were seen as less speculative bets than those in other countries. <!-- -->These are more or less the same circumstances investors face today.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here’s a look at why the return of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/business/mutfund/a-possible-alternative-to-stocks-and-bonds-commodities.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">TINA market</a> could keep the bull market going, and what could be different in 2019.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Any of the following could arguably derail the decade-long economic expansion and the rally: the seemingly never-ending trade war between China and the United States, a slowing global economy and simmering geopolitical tensions that could escalate into a full-blown conflict.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A recession would wreak havoc on corporate profits and would cause investors to flee riskier assets such as stocks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But a downturn in the United States is not imminent — employment and economic data make that clear. Investors have become convinced that the Fed will act aggressively to lower rates to keep the expansion going. In the futures market that investors use to bet on the Fed’s decisions, nearly 90 percent expect at least two rate cuts by the end of 2019, and 53 percent anticipate at least three.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That signaled an abrupt U-turn for Fed policymakers, whose seeming determination to continue raising rates caused a market meltdown at the end of last year. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The decade-long bull market has racked up record highs and broken through one milestone after another. Each instance has been met with skepticism. And that does not seem to have changed this year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The percentage of individual investors who say they expect American stocks to rise over the next six months has remained below its historical average for nine straight weeks, according to the American Association of Individual Investors’ weekly survey. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Bank of America Merrill Lynch called its June survey of fund managers its most bearish since the financial crisis.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The rates on long-term government bonds have declined this year, as well as the expectations of bond investors for inflation over the next five years. That indicates there is significant concern about the strength of the economy in the coming years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You are not seeing the party hats going on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange,” said JC O’Hara, the<!-- --> <!-- -->chief market technician at MKM Partners. “The average investor has a healthy degree of skepticism. They are very aware of the signs that an economic slowdown is taking place. But in a TINA market, where are they going to put their money?”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The lack of exuberance surrounding the rally may be a reason to think it can keep going. Investor sentiment is often viewed as a contrarian indicator: When optimism is high, it can indicate that investors are ignoring risks and plowing money into stocks on the belief they can only go up. Conversely, if investors become too pessimistic, it can indicate the market has hit a bottom.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Right now, investors are more neutral. That means a rate cut, along with better than expected corporate results and economic data, could inspire the skeptics to buy and\\xa0keep the rally going. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The market continues to believe we have this ‘Goldilocks’ situation. That stocks can continue to make new highs and a lot of assets can all perform well together,” said Andrew Sheets, a strategist at Morgan Stanley. “But there are a number of reasons we believe that this is not 2013 or 2015 or even the late 1990s, another period when the Fed cut and the markets did quite well.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For one, Wall Street’s expectations for earnings remain too high, Mr. Sheets said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When companies reported first-quarter results, they seemed reluctant to lower the financial forecasts for the year ahead. But since then, trade talks aimed at reaching a deal between China and the United States, which many believed was imminent as recently as the end of April, have broken down, and the economic data has weakened. That means that when companies start reporting second-quarter results, they are likely to issue forecasts that reflect a more difficult 12 months ahead, Mr. Sheets said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Also, a number of economic measures looked more stretched than they did five years ago when the labor market was still strengthening and consumer confidence was improving, Mr. Sheets said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s true that the United States economy is still adding jobs, but at a slower pace than it did last year or even earlier this year, and consumer confidence is high but not improving.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Sheets is not expecting a sharp downturn. After stocks have gained 19 percent this year, he and his colleagues at Morgan Stanley, are skeptical the market can continue to march higher.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But in a market that has primarily been fueled by the prospect for interest rate cuts, there is good news for investors: When the Fed starts cutting rates, stocks typically rally for the year that follows. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you look at all the initial rate cuts since 1954, they have tended to push the markets higher over the next 12 months,” said Audrey Kaplan, the head of global equity strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">According to her research, the S&amp;P 500 gained about 14 percent on average the year after the Fed’s first cut. The gains have come in 13 out of the 16 instances. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Investors have spent much of the past decade counting on the Fed to keep the bull market going, and the central bank has delivered what investors hoped for. What investors have to grapple with now, is how long this will continue.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This has been called the most unloved bull market in history, but it will be the most highly anticipated bear market whenever the next one comes around,” Mr. O’Hara said. “Whether that is today, tomorrow, a month from now or a year, that is the question right now.”</p>',\n",

       " 'subway-franchisees': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Manoj Tripathi couldn’t shake the feeling that someone had a vendetta against his Subway sandwich shop. A franchisee for nearly two decades, he had done everything he could to keep his restaurant, in a strip mall in Northern California, in perfect condition. But lately it seemed like someone was out to get him.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was the middle of 2017, and inspectors sent by Subway’s regional manager were finding a new problem to cite each month: a handprint on the glass door, the wrong brand of bathroom soap, cucumber slices that were too thick, he said. They seemed to be little things, but with each write-up, Mr. Tripathi’s grip on his store weakened. If he racked up enough infractions, Subway could terminate his contract and take control of the business.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When an inspector named Rebecca Husler arrived one day that September, Mr. Tripathi thought his restaurant was pristine. Then he noticed that a single light fixture needed a new bulb. Mr. Tripathi rushed out to buy a replacement, but by the time he returned, Ms. Husler had marked it as a violation. A year later, just as he feared, he lost the Subway.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Tripathi wasn’t paranoid. Ms. Husler really was out to get him. She had specific instructions from her boss, the regional Subway supervisor, to find fault with the store, she said in an interview.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was kind of his hit man,” she said, sipping an iced tea at a Starbucks in the Bay Area. Ms. Husler worked for the regional supervisor for nearly a year, she said, and she has come to regret the role she played in pushing a group of store owners out of their investments. The light-bulb moment with Mr. Tripathi, especially, gave her pause. “We’re ruining these people,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway is the largest fast-food company in the world by store count, with more than 24,000 restaurants in the United States alone. It got that way thanks in large part to entrepreneurial immigrants. Unlike at chains such as McDonald’s and Burger King, where many franchises are operated by investment firms, Subway owners are mostly individuals and families. The company’s co-founder, Fred DeLuca, made stores easy to open; most new franchisees are charged a $15,000 initial fee, compared to $45,000 at McDonald’s. In exchange, Subway operators must hand over more revenue than at many other chains — 8 percent of gross sales — while also agreeing to other fees and stipulations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For half a century, the system worked to mutual advantage. Subway’s value hit $12.3 billion, and countless first-generation Americans bootstrapped their way to success, one foot-long at a time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the time <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/business/fred-deluca-co-founder-of-subway-sandwich-chain-dies-at-67.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Mr. DeLuca died in 2015</a>, though, the company was struggling. Rivals like Jimmy John’s and Quiznos had grown, and Subway’s spokesman, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/business/jared-fogle-former-subway-pitchman-gets-15-year-prison-term.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Jared Fogle</a>, pleaded guilty to child sex and pornography charges. Mr. DeLuca’s sister, Suzanne Greco, took over as chief executive, inheriting a company that many felt had grown too fast and haphazardly. In 2016, for the first time ever, more Subway stores closed than opened. But while many franchisees shut down because of underperformance, others operating profitable locations began to feel targeted, too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For many owners, Subway’s internal workings are a mystery. The chain, which is private, offers far less financial information than other global fast-food peers. In the most recent version of a disclosure document given to prospective franchisees, which is more than 600 pages long, the company notes that it can revise its rules “at any time during the term of your Franchise Agreement under any condition and to any extent.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The document would be difficult for anyone to process. But Alexander Dembski, who trained many new Subway owners over a 34-year career, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1998/03/16/239302/index.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">estimated to Fortune</a> in 1998 that 30 to 50 percent of the chain’s franchisees were immigrants, and that more than a third of applicants scored poorly on proficiency tests in math and English.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before his death, Mr. DeLuca was accused of using bullying tactics that left many operators struggling to recoup their investments, leading to lawsuits, regulatory run-ins, government investigations and constant complaints from franchisees. One of the most persistent areas of protest has involved a class of Subway managers known as development agents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway parcels its vast network of stores into more than 100 regional fiefs. Each is overseen by a development agent, who recruits new franchisees, approves buyers for existing stores and sends inspectors — known as field consultants — to conduct monthly reviews. But usually, development agents are also franchisees themselves. When that is the case, they are both in charge of and competing with other store operators, and their own locations are inspected by people they hire.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These feel like conflicts of interest to many Subway owners — giving development agents the means and motivation to shut down competing stores and take over profitable ones by manipulating inspections. Many franchisees who have lost their restaurants say that they have recouped little of their original investments. Intervention from Subway’s headquarters in Connecticut is rare.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Don Fertman, Subway’s chief development officer and a veteran of the company for 38 years, said that owning restaurants helps give development agents “a better understanding of all aspects of owning a small business.” He said the company reviews the agents’ work and expects them to uphold ethical standards, dealing with violations “on a case-by-case basis.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Across the country, franchisees have lodged complaints and filed lawsuits. In West Virginia, Bhrugesh and Utpala Vyas ran three stores, two of them top performers in the territory, they said. In a 2017 filing in federal court in Connecticut, Ms. Vyas accused the local development agent, the man’s son and an inspector of conspiring to take over the stores by concocting “unreasonably harsh evaluations.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A judge ruled against Ms. Vyas. Records from local health departments and Subway show that at least two of the stores are now co-owned by the inspector and the development agent. “I feel very bad, and my blood is boiling,” Mr. Vyas said in an interview. “This was our hard-earned money.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Fertman said that complaints like those Mr. Vyas filed are “unfounded,” and that Subway “makes every effort” to help noncompliant franchisees improve. He added that the company is “in the business of selling sandwiches — not closing restaurants, not marking people out of compliance.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Our business development agents are well-respected members of our business community,” he said. “And when we hear these allegations, I would say that they are false.” He said he was not aware of any exceptions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For years, the Subway system’s opacity and aggressive pace of development — Mr. DeLuca once dreamed of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-02-27/subway-s-deluca-sees-sandwich-chain-expanding-to-50-000-shops\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">opening 50,000 stores by 2017</a> — went hand in hand. The company encouraged stores to open within blocks of existing locations, with development agents often giving the established franchisees a choice: Operate the new restaurant themselves, or compete with someone recruited by Subway. Franchisees, feeling pressured, sometimes took the first option.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It was assumed that the stores would, eventually, become sustainable,” Mr. Tripathi said. An immigrant from India, he bought into Subway’s expansion in a major way. After two decades spent at companies like Jamba Juice and the Body Shop, opening Subway franchises was his chance to take charge. At one point, he owned 38 stores, and by 2015 he was among the largest franchisees in California’s East Bay region.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That was when Ms. Greco took over Subway, and the company’s store count began to shrink. In the East Bay, Mr. Tripathi was under the jurisdiction of a development agent named Chirayu Patel, known as Akki. He oversaw a huge, choice territory that included most of Northern California and western Nevada. Mr. Patel also owned dozens of Subway stores.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2016, he convened a franchisee meeting in a Sacramento warehouse. He told everyone that Subway wanted to improve its strongest restaurants and shut down the weaker ones, according to Nikku Aulakh, a franchisee who was present.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She left the gathering alarmed. She and many fellow franchisees had been pushed for years to invest huge sums in new stores that were now struggling. Subway’s franchise contract forbids the company from unilaterally closing stores just because sales are weak. But franchisees can lose control of their restaurants for failing to meet Subway’s operating standards — violations cited by inspectors employed by development agents like Mr. Patel.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Aulakh said Mr. Patel eventually pressured her into closing or selling her four stores in Sacramento, after they received a slew of bad evaluations. “I would have liked to stay in business for another 10 to 15 years,” she said. “I wanted to make more money, but I had no other choice.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Vishal Sharma, a franchisee in Nevada who owned three stores, described another meeting that Mr. Patel convened in Reno the same year. In front of some 20 store operators, Mr. Patel said that he had “the money to buy the best lawyers,” Mr. Sharma recalled. “At the time, we weren’t scared. We thought that maybe that was just his style. Then we figure out that this guy’s template is not developing the territory, it’s taking away the territory.” (Mr. Patel said in an email that he had been informing the franchisees that Subway’s lawyers were available to answer legal questions.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At one point, a franchisee sent Mr. Patel an anonymous complaint; he responded with an email to a large group of them, which was reviewed by The Times. He threatened a lawsuit that “would be so huge it would nearly take all of your life earnings in Subway in fighting this suit. Please don’t test me especially when you don’t have any basis.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway terminated Mr. Sharma’s contracts in 2017. Last December, in state court, he accused Mr. Patel of using “rigged compliances” and Subway of employing an “unusual structure where the local agent is a supervisor, as well as a competitor.” The case was ordered into arbitration in Connecticut, but Mr. Sharma is appealing the decision.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Husler, the inspector who called herself Mr. Patel’s “hit man,” said that Mr. Patel considered his own interests when determining what stores would be sent to arbitration, and likely closed. When it came time to conduct inspections, she said, Mr. Patel made it “very clear that his stores were to pass” and that “the people he wanted out of the system were to fail out of the system.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Times reviewed text messages about individual franchisees in which Mr. Patel assigned evaluations to certain inspectors “so we can get this guy out of the system.” But when it came to his own stores, there was a different standard, according to Effie Lennox, a former inspector who worked for Mr. Patel in Northern California from 2007 to 2010. She said that he asked her not to report violations at his locations and to email him about them instead.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That was the problem: He was a franchisee and a development agent,” she said. “And especially with someone like him, having that conflict of interest is the worst-case scenario for the franchisee, because he’s in it for his own benefit, not for theirs.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Lennox said that she often went behind Mr. Patel’s back to warn franchisees that they were being targeted. “These are people’s livelihoods,” she said. “I felt like I needed to undo the damage that he was doing to these poor people.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an email to The Times, Mr. Patel said that he had acted appropriately at all times, and that his goal is for all of the stores in his territory to be successful. He said that evaluations at stores owned by Mr. Tripathi, Ms. Aulakh and Mr. Sharma were “conducted in a manner consistent with evaluations of other Subway restaurants.” There were problems with sales at Mr. Tripathi’s stores and food safety at Mr. Sharma’s locations, he said. Mr. Patel added that he and his team “have no intention of deliberately falsifying” evaluations and would never train inspectors to do so, and that noncompliant restaurant owners are given the chance to correct violations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dozens of franchisees in the region decided to appeal to Ms. Greco for help. Mr. Tripathi was one of them. “There is a deep sense of morass within the franchisee community,” the group wrote in a 2016 letter. Soon after, they wrote again, asking that Ms. Greco “designate somebody impartial to look into the matter.” The franchisees said that they suspected Subway’s development agents of commissioning “unfair/biased/questionable evaluations” and forcing franchisees out “at a throwaway price.” They feared retaliation. “Needless to say, time is of the essence,” they wrote.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Greco did not respond, they said. (Subway said it always has “open lines for franchisees through multiple channels of communication.”) But Mr. Patel heard about the letter and was enraged, Ms. Husler said. He wanted all of the franchisees involved ejected from his region, she said. Ms. Husler recalled Mr. Patel instructing her: “Go in there and just throw your probe right into that food. It’s not going to make temperature, and you can mark them out of compliance.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He actually gave us specifics on what he wanted us to do,” Ms. Husler added — such as directing her to visit during shifts with inexperienced employees who were more likely to make mistakes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Not all of the franchisees who have left the Subway system operated their stores perfectly, and many ran afoul of local health inspectors in addition to the company’s evaluators. But dozens of franchisees contend that issues that never bothered Subway during its rapid expansion suddenly put them out of business in recent years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those franchisees feel that they have little recourse. Near Sacramento, Minal Khatri and her husband owned a Subway in a prime location, just off the freeway. After Mr. Patel’s inspector repeatedly marked it out of compliance around 2014, she recalled, she and her husband started to fight constantly: Why were they failing? Why couldn’t he get everything into compliance? Ms. Khatri said they both repeatedly asked Subway headquarters for advice, but never got a response. Eventually, the company took her into arbitration, and she said she was told to find a buyer for her store or risk forcible closing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Patel rejected all of the candidates she found, she said; records indicate that he now owns her restaurant. Ms. Khatri and her husband divorced. It was only after it became clear that Mr. Patel wanted to buy her store, she said, that she realized her husband might not have been to blame for everything after all. Mr. Patel said the Khatris asked him to buy the restaurant.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another franchisee, Kanwardeep Virk, said that starting in 2006, he operated four stores in the Lake Tahoe area that were profitable and compliant with Subway’s standards — his “babies,” he called them. Suddenly, at the beginning of 2016, he said, he started failing evaluations. He said one inspector sabotaged a meatball storage bag, by puncturing it with a thermometer and then waiting to record its temperature.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway started arbitration proceedings against Mr. Virk. Such cases are typically heard near Subway’s headquarters in Connecticut. Many store owners cannot afford to travel to defend their stores in person, and argue their cases by phone or by filing documents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2018, Subway initiated the equivalent of 29 litigation actions (mostly arbitrations) per 1,000 franchisees, compared to 1.4 actions for McDonald’s, Dunkin’ Donuts, Pizza Hut, Burger King and Wendy’s combined, according to an analysis of the companies’ disclosure documents by John Gordon, a restaurant industry expert at Pacific Management Consulting Group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Eventually, Mr. Virk gave up. Mr. Patel now owns two of his former stores. In his emailed statement, Mr. Patel wrote that the restaurants had problems with food safety and labor practices and owed back rent, and that Mr. Virk himself arranged to close or transfer them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Federal Trade Commission requires Subway to produce an annual list of franchisees with permanently closed stores, which the company said “allows prospective franchise owners the opportunity to contact them to discuss their experience with Subway.” But many franchisees who received termination letters after being deemed noncompliant eventually sold their stores — sometimes under duress and often for far less than they believed the stores were worth, several franchisees said. Those locations are recorded as transfers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Franchisees say that this classification allows Subway and other franchisers to mislead potential store owners. But government oversight is limited. The F.T.C.’s compliance guide for franchisers has not been updated in more than a decade. Lois Greisman, the associate director of the Division of Marketing Practices, said that the agency had not focused on franchise misconduct or taken any franchise-related enforcement action in years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway is in the midst of an ambitious makeover campaign, hiring a firm that has worked with Tiffany &amp; Company and Saks Fifth Avenue, adding to its menu and stocking remodeled stores with new technology.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Since Mr. DeLuca’s death, the company has been on shaky footing. It was slower than many rivals to launch a digital loyalty program and mobile ordering options. Revenue fell to $10.4 billion last year, down 9.5 percent from 2015, according to the market research firm Technomic. In recent months, the chain has added a new chief information officer, a chief marketing officer and a North American vice president. Ms. Greco retired last year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway’s store count has shrunk by more than 2,000 since 2015. “We have to look at each and every location and optimize our footprint accordingly,” said Mr. Fertman, Subway’s chief development officer. “We have to make sure, ultimately, that we have the right restaurants in the right locations.” Other executives have called it an “optimization” effort.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat from Nevada, wrote in a letter in May to the Small Business Administration that franchisees had accused Subway of “using minor infractions to steal the stores from owners through a rigged arbitration system,” citing reporting by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/05/05/subways-arbitration-for-minor-infractions-is-out-of-control-franchisees/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">The New York Post</a>. “I am troubled by increasing complaints from entrepreneurs about unfair practices that are causing them financial difficulties,” she wrote. The agency said in its reply that, out of 1,551 federally backed loans approved for Subway franchisees in the past decade, 12 percent were charged off, or deemed unlikely to be repaid — a far higher rate than the average franchise loan.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Subway, in an email, said that the franchisees who alleged misconduct were “anomalies,” and that its surveys and “listening tours” found that 80 percent of franchisees in the system want to keep working with the company.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On the day after Memorial Day, Mr. Tripathi and his wife, Sadhana, stopped by one of the 10 Subways they still own, in an outdoor shopping mall in Orinda, Calif. The cashier at the restaurant cracked jokes with customers. Fans spun overhead. Every light bulb shone.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Tripathis said they fear they could lose yet more of their stores. They sued Subway and Mr. Patel in 2016 in California court, accusing the development agent of “using a variety of techniques including trumped-up and false inspection reports to justify terminating certain franchises.” Subway invoked the clause in the franchisee contract that requires disputes to be resolved in private arbitration in Connecticut. The Tripathis have filed an appeal for the case to proceed in California.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Tripathi, a trained engineer with a business degree, and Ms. Tripathi, who holds a doctorate in chemistry, said they were mostly able to read and understand the reams of legal documents produced by the conflict. Many of their fellow franchisees cannot, they said. “The reason we were fighting them is that we can,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But he and his wife are getting tired of the Subway system. “We worked so hard, we gave up our own careers,” Ms. Tripathi said. “We’ve been through so much, but it’s not worth it anymore.”</p>',\n",

       " 'supplements-and-diets-for-heart-health-show-limited-proof-of-benefit': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Millions of Americans use dietary supplements and a variety of diets to protect their heart health. But a large new analysis found that there was strikingly little proof from rigorous studies that supplements and some widely recommended diets have the power to prevent heart disease.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new research, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://annals.org/aim/article/doi/10.7326/M19-0341\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">published in the Annals of Internal Medicine</a>, reviewed data from hundreds of clinical trials involving almost a million people and found that only a few of 16 popular supplements and just one of the eight diets evaluated had any noticeable effect on cardiovascular outcomes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Folic acid, reduced salt diets and omega-3 fatty acids, the kind found in fish oil, showed some benefits. But the evidence was fairly weak. And at least one showed evidence of harm: Taking calcium with vitamin D increased the risk of stroke, possibly because it increases blood clotting and hardening of the arteries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The findings are likely to elicit controversy and continued debate. But the researchers said one clear message from their analysis was that the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://europepmc.org/abstract/med/21592424\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">more than half of Americans</a> who use dietary supplements should be wary of claims that multivitamins and other supplements will improve their heart health.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“People who are taking these supplements for the sake of improving their cardiovascular health are wasting their money,” said Dr. Safi U. Khan, an assistant professor at West Virginia University School of Medicine and the lead author of the new study.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The findings regarding supplements dovetail with the conclusions of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24217421\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a report by the United States Preventive Services Task Force</a>, an influential group of health experts that reviewed vitamin and mineral supplements in 2013 and found little proof that they promote cardiovascular health. “This has been shown very consistently,” Dr. Khan said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new study was exhaustive. The authors examined 24 supplements and diets by analyzing data from 277 trials of cardiovascular prevention involving a total of 992,000 people. To get conclusive answers, they selected only randomized controlled trials, in which people are randomly assigned to various interventions for a set period of time and which are considered the “gold standard” for testing treatments. Weaker data from observational studies, which can show only correlations and not cause and effect, were excluded. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ultimately the researchers found a surprising lack of tangible benefits for almost everything they looked at, both supplements and diets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Among the supplements that showed no evidence of cardiovascular protection were vitamins A, B, C, D and E, as well as beta-carotene, calcium, iron, antioxidants and multivitamins. While two supplements were found to have some benefit, folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, there were important caveats.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Taking folic acid was found to lower the risk of stroke. But the finding was largely driven by research from China, where deficiencies of the vitamin are common. The researchers said it was not clear that people who take folic acid in America, where foods are fortified with it, will get the same benefit. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Fish oil, one of the most popular supplements in America, is widely used for its omega-3 fatty acids, which are anti-inflammatory. A <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30415628\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">recent clinical trial</a> found that high-risk patients who took very large doses of Vascepa, a purified form of omega-3 that is available by prescription only, had a reduction in cardiovascular events. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30415637\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Another study</a> found that supplementing with fish oil could benefit people who eat very little seafood. But the majority of trials involving fish oil have been disappointing. Dr. Khan and his colleagues concluded that there was only weak evidence at best that taking fish oil could prevent heart disease.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This just reinforces that the supplement story is so shaky,” said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, who wrote <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://annals.org/aim/article/doi/10.7326/M19-1498\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">an editorial accompanying the new review</a>. “Not only is there the potential for harm, but there’s also no hard evidence for good.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When Dr. Khan and his co-authors looked at various diets recommended for cardiovascular prevention, they found a similar lack of solid evidence.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That was certainly the case for low-fat diets, which health authorities have recommended for decades as a way to lower cholesterol and heart disease risk. Dr. Khan and his colleagues found that the most rigorous randomized trials provided no evidence that eating less fat, including saturated fat, had an impact on mortality or cardiovascular outcomes. Low-fat diets <!-- -->have largely fallen out of favor<!-- --> among health authorities in recent years, though the federal government’s dietary guidelines still encourage people to limit their intake of foods rich in saturated fat, such as butter, meat and cheese.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One diet that remains highly touted by health authorities is the Mediterranean diet, with its abundance of whole grains, beans, nuts, fruits and vegetables and olive oil. While clinical trials have found that it reduces cardiovascular risk, some of the major ones have been flawed, and experts who have scrutinized the evidence for the diet <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27509006\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">have urged caution</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the largest and most publicized Mediterranean diet trials, called Predimed and published in 2013, found that it <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/health/mediterranean-diet-can-cut-heart-disease-study-finds.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">reduced heart attacks and strokes</a>. But last year it <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/health/mediterranean-diet-heart-disease.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">was retracted</a> because of methodological problems. The Predimed authors published a new analysis of their data, claiming their conclusions had not changed. But other Mediterranean diet trials have been <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16054927\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">embroiled in similar controversies</a>. After analyzing data from all the relevant trials, Dr. Khan and his colleagues found that “the totality of evidence did not favor the Mediterranean diet for cardiovascular outcomes.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s not favorable or harmful,” he added. “It’s just a neutral diet from a cardiovascular perspective.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The one dietary intervention that seemed to have the most support from randomized trials was lowering salt intake, though the researchers graded the evidence only as having “moderate certainty.” And there was nuance. Low-salt diets reduced mortality from all causes only in people with normal blood pressure. Among people with hypertension, lowering salt intake reduced deaths from heart disease but not from other causes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Topol said that in his own clinic he sees a wide range of responses to salt intake. Some people are very sensitive to salt: A small increase in salty foods can have a pronounced effect on their blood pressure. But others can eat salt-laden meals and their blood pressure will hardly budge.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Dr. Topol sa<!-- -->id he finds diet studies hard to interpret because they rarely take into account the unique way that different people can have markedly different responses to dietary changes, whether it is cutting back on salt or avoiding fat or carbohydrates.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The problem we have here is that all these studies essentially treat all people as one,” he said. “I think that all these things are going to turn out to be quite heterogeneous. Maybe salt restriction really is beneficial for some, but we haven’t defined the people yet that would drive that.”</p>',\n",

       " 'sweden-economy-immigration': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">FILIPSTAD, Sweden — At first, local leaders were inclined to see the refugees as an opportunity. The iron ore mines had shut down. So had a factory that made machinery for the logging industry. The town had been abandoned, its population cut in half. A shot at replenishment appeared at hand.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was the summer of 2015, and people were arriving from some of the most troubled places on earth — Syria, Somalia, Iraq. They would fill vacant homes, learn Swedish, and take jobs caring for older Swedes. They would pay taxes, helping finance the extensive social welfare programs that have made Sweden a rarity in the world, a country seemingly at peace in an age of tempestuous global capitalism.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But four years after the influx, growing numbers of native-born Swedes have come to see the refugees as a drain on public finances. Some decry an assault on “Swedish heritage,” or “Swedish culture,” or other words that mean white, Christian and familiar. Antipathy for immigrants now threatens to erode support for Sweden’s social welfare state.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“People don’t want to pay taxes to support people who don’t work,” says Urban Pettersson, 62, a member of the local council here in Filipstad, a town set in lake country west of Stockholm. “Ninety percent of the refugees don’t contribute to society. These people are going to have a lifelong dependence on social welfare. This is a huge problem.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a global economy increasingly besieged by rage over inequality and the pitfalls of winner-take-all capitalism, Sweden has long stood out as a kinder, gentler sort of country, a potential template for other nations eager to avoid destructive populism.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The so-called Nordic model that prevails in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland has been engineered to protect people from the commonplace economic afflictions assailing many developed countries, and especially the United States. There, the loss of a job can swiftly imperil health care, housing, sustenance and mental well-being. Under the Nordic model, governments typically furnish health care, education and pensions to everyone.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The state delivers subsidized housing and child care. When people lose jobs, they gain unemployment benefits and highly effective job training programs. When children are born, parents avail themselves of paid leave that seems unimaginable in most societies — 480 days in Sweden.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you’re born in Sweden, you’ve basically won at life,” says Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As world leaders debate how to keep the innovative forces of capitalism while more equitably spreading the bounty, the Nordic model is often played up as a promising approach.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the rest of the world, workers generally fear automation as a threat to paychecks. In Sweden, people are <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/the-robots-are-coming-and-sweden-is-fine.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">strikingly optimistic</a> <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/the-robots-are-coming-and-sweden-is-fine.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">about robots</a> given their faith in the social welfare model. If technology destroys some jobs, it will create others, they reckon, while training and state support will enable them to manage the transition.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the endurance of the Nordic model has long depended on two crucial elements — the public’s willingness to pay some of the highest taxes on earth, and the understanding that everyone is supposed to work. The state ensures that working-age people are prepared with the skills for high-wage jobs, in industries like technology and advanced manufacturing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sweden’s sharp influx of immigrants — the largest of any European nation, as a share of the overall population — directly tests this proposition.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the peak in 2015, 160,000 refugees sought asylum in Sweden, a country of 10 million people. That is equivalent to more than five million refugees arriving in the United States in a year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over the last two decades, the share of foreign-born people has risen from 11 percent of the Swedish population to 19 percent. Many of the refugees have little education and do not speak Swedish, making them difficult to employ.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Public opinion surveys show that Swedes remain willing to accept their tax burden. But as citizens absorb the reality that many refugees will rely on welfare for years, some are balking at the cost while demanding limits on government aid for jobless people.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“People are quite open to showing solidarity for people who are like themselves,” says Carl Melin, policy director at Futurion, a research institution in Stockholm. “They don’t show solidarity for people who are different.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The primary vessel of discontent is the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing political party with roots in the neo-Nazi movement. Over the last decade, the party has emerged from the extremist wilderness to secure mainstream status, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/world/europe/sweden-elections.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">last year capturing the third largest bloc of seats in Parliament</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The party has gained force amid anger over an economy that has stagnated in recent years, and frustration over cuts to social services that have been unfolding for a quarter-century.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The party has also been propelled by revulsion over multiculturalism in towns like Filipstad, where Muslim women in headscarves now wheel toddlers down sidewalks.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These immigrants don’t speak the same language,” complains Mr. Pettersson, a Sweden Democrat, over coffee in a downtown cafe specializing in Swedish pastries. “They have different religions, different ways of life. If there are too many differences, it’s harder to get along. It’s interesting to meet someone from another country for maybe half an hour, but if you’re going to live together, it’s tough.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He favors sending refugees back to their home countries through “voluntary repatriation,” he says, rather than squandering public money on doomed efforts to integrate them.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We don’t have infinite resources,” Mr. Pettersson says. “Either it’s higher taxes, or you have to cut something.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sweden has long had a reputation for welcoming the exiles of war. And it also claims distinction as the nation that <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www2.compareyourcountry.org/oda?cr=oecd&amp;lg=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">spends the largest percentage of its wealth on aid for developing countries</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’ve seen ourselves as a superpower in terms of doing good things,” says Marten Blix, an economist at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the national government began bringing refugees to Filipstad in 2012, local officials received assurances they would not be left to fend for themselves.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The state was eager to put refugees in small towns rather than in cities like Stockholm, where housing was scarce and expensive. National authorities agreed to cover rent, food, clothing and specialized medical care for the first two years. After that, municipalities would inherit responsibility, though costs were assumed to be minimal: By then, most refugees would supposedly be able to support themselves.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That was a fantasy, says Hannes Fellsman.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He manages work and education programs at a unit the local government set up in 2015 to prepare refugees for careers. He and his colleagues quickly grasped this was going to require substantial resources.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Early waves of refugees from Syria and Iraq included doctors, accountants and other professionals. Language training allowed them to resume their careers. The people arriving later tended to have little education. Many had suffered trauma, requiring mental health counseling.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Roughly one-fifth of Filipstad’s nearly 11,000 inhabitants are now foreign-born. Among the 750 working-age people, 500 have received less than a high school education. Two hundred are illiterate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The state keeps saying we need to prepare people to get jobs fast,” Mr. Fellsman says. “That’s impossible. You have to educate them.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Preparing lower-skilled refugees for work would be a challenge anywhere. In Sweden it is uniquely difficult, given how the economy is centered on highly skilled, highly paid pursuits. It has been engineered to minimize the sorts of low-paying service sector jobs that consign people in other countries to the ranks of the working poor.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some argue that Sweden must allow lower-wage service sector jobs to emerge, enabling immigrants to secure a hold in the economy by cleaning homes or taking care of children — ideally with a government subsidy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But unions are hostile, seeing this as a dangerous precedent that could expose Sweden to the forces of downward mobility at work in other countries. Until recently, Swedes were not accustomed to hiring people for menial work, typically preferring to clean their own homes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet absent some fresh approach to increasing employment, an alarming divide seems certain to widen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The unemployment rate was only 3.8 percent among the Swedish-born populace last year, but 15 percent among foreign-born, notes Marika Lindgren Asbrink, a researcher at LO, Sweden’s largest labor union. Roughly half of all jobless people in Sweden were foreign-born.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Among supporters of the Sweden Democrats, these sorts of numbers are cited as evidence that refugees have flocked here to enjoy lives of state-financed sloth.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have to demand that people work or they cannot get benefits,” says Ted Bondesson, a 22-year-old university student, as he celebrates Flag Day at a barbecue thrown by the Sweden Democrats in the southern town of Horby. “We can’t pay for the whole world.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The mayor of the town, Cecilia In Zito, a Sweden Democrat, says refugees have refused to assimilate. “I would start by forcing them to learn Swedish,” she says.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Such depictions astonish Babak Jamali.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Six years ago, when he was 13, he left his home in war-torn Afghanistan, riding in the trunk of a car through Pakistan and into Iran. There, he found construction jobs for about $2 a day, squatting in half-finished apartment blocks while struggling to evade police.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He paid a smuggler to truck him into Turkey. He rode buses up the Balkan Peninsula and eventually to Germany, where he slept on the floor of a mosque. He rode a train to the Swedish city of Malmo and applied for asylum. For the last year, he has lived with a pro-refugee activist in the fields outside Horby in a house heated by a wood stove and lacking plumbing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On paper, Mr. Jamali, 19, is the worst case for Sweden. Before arriving, he had no formal schooling, making him another illiterate, unskilled person ill-suited for work. But he chafes at the notion that he is a drain on society.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He cannot work while his asylum case is pending, so he goes into Horby six days a week to study Swedish. He walks 15 minutes up a dirt road to the highway, even in subzero temperatures, and then waits for a bus that takes 40 minutes. One bus driver refuses to pick him up. Swedes holler at him from passing cars, telling him to go home.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What home?” he says. “I have no home.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His first asylum claim was denied. He has filed an appeal. If he loses, he faces deportation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This possibility fills him with dread. If he lands back in Afghanistan, he will be just another jobless young person. In Sweden, he has become a full-time student, nearly fluent in Swedish, and keen to forge a career as an electrician.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I want to live the way other people live,” he says.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For most Swedes, the benefits of immigration remain intact. The Nordic model is proven, justifying taxpayer investments toward settling refugees, say economists. Many will struggle to work, but their children will grow up speaking Swedish. They will graduate from Swedish schools into jobs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Immigration doesn’t shake the Swedish welfare model in any way,” says Claes Hultgren, the municipal manager in Filipstad. “When we have succeeded with these people, this is a huge resource for Sweden.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The average refugee in Sweden receives about 74,000 Swedish kronor (about $7,800) more in government services than they pay into the system, Joakim Ruist, an economist at the University of Gothenburg, concluded in a report released last year and commissioned by the Ministry of Finance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Over all, the cost of social programs for refugees runs about 1 percent of Sweden’s annual national economic output, about as much as Sweden now spends on international aid. The economy is growing. The government’s finances are solid.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Sweden can bear this cost,” Mr. Ruist says. “This seemingly unsolvable refugee crisis is fully solvable.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Filipstad, refugee families of five and more are packed into apartments built for two. Local schools have seen multiplying reports of concern — anything from students missing class to evidence of hunger. Violent crime is increasing. So is drug use.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The job training unit represents an effort to arrest that trajectory.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On a recent morning, Saadia Osman sits in a classroom on the second floor of a government building overlooking a lake. She and 11 other refugees are learning Swedish tailored to work in a restaurant kitchen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A mother of three, Ms. Osman, 39, arrived in Sweden six years ago, having fled the war in her native Somalia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At first, the government paid the 6,400 kronor a month rent (about $675) on their two-room apartment. It gave them money for food and clothing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Her husband studied Swedish and attended city-run work trainings. Three years ago, he landed a job at a nearby factory that makes Swedish crisp bread, earning 20,000 kronor a month (about $2,100). They now pay their own rent. Ms. Osman, a preschool teacher in Somalia, wants her own job.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are all eager to work,” she says. “It’s not good to sit around at home and do nothing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But as the local government seeks to multiply such successes, it is operating with a shortage of money. Most refugees can study only part time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We don’t have the money for more,” says Mr. Fellsman.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Three years ago, the national government gave Filipstad 55 million kronor (about $5.8 million) to cover the extra costs of supporting refugees. That money runs out this year. National authorities recently approved plans for an additional $34 million in aid for local governments, less than initially proposed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sweden sits at a crossroads. Taxpayers can swallow the costs of integrating refugees, or reject that burden and risk a defining division: White, native-born Swedes will retain jobs and comfortable lives, while dark-skinned immigrants sink into poverty and joblessness in isolated ghettos.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are creating more and more hostility in our country,” says Dan Andersson, a former chief economist at LO. “We are creating an underclass of unskilled people, because we aren’t helping them with resources.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">From where Johnny Grahn sits, Sweden is already helping too much.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A bus driver by profession, he occupies a seat on the Filipstad government council, representing the Sweden Democrats. His face tightens at mention of the refugees. As he describes it, they have overwhelmed the community.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The mosque established in the former home of a prominent Swedish conservative intellectual, Sven Stolpe, rudely awakens neighbors with the call to prayer, Mr. Grahn complains. Local housing complexes are full of foreigners, he says, while preschools have been “inundated” with refugee children.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the greatest indignity is the impact on the local budget, Mr. Grahn says.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">People are waiting weeks to see dentists. The council recently cut a popular activity coordinator at a local senior center. At the same time, the local government’s welfare payments have soared over the past decade from 6 million kronor (about $632,00) to 29 million (more than $3 million).</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To Mr. Grahn and his allies in the Sweden Democrat party, the takeaway is obvious: Refugees are absorbing an outsize share of resources, leaving less money for everyone else.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The services that you pay taxes for have been reduced drastically,” he says. “There is almost a collapse in the system. When there are so many people arriving who don’t work, the whole thing falls apart.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In fact, public dismay over cuts to government programs is an old story in Sweden, one that long predates the recent influx of refugees.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After an economic crisis in the early 1990s, Sweden lowered taxes and reduced spending, trimming unemployment benefits and pensions. Complaints about delays in the health care system have become legion, with wealthier people resorting to private insurance.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But that picture is complicated, involving history, the changing ideological whims of the electorate and the complexities of national programs.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Filipstad, as in other communities, a simpler, readily identified culprit now takes blame for nearly every social problem — the refugees. Driving the narrative is an assumption shared widely among Sweden Democrats that money spent trying to integrate refugees is money wasted.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are taking in people who don’t want to learn Swedish and don’t want to enter society,” says Mr. Grahn. “Integration isn’t just about us helping them. They have to want it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Beyond Sweden, this sort of thinking tears at the foundations of the Nordic model in an era of mass migration.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“People’s willingness to continue paying the very high taxes needed to finance the social welfare programs is not something that can be taken for granted,” says Mr. Blix, the economist. “We are now beginning to see the emergence of some serious cracks.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To outsiders, the Nordic model may seem governed by benevolence, by a collectivist spirit that places value on ensuring that no one goes without fundamental needs like health care and housing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Sweden’s experience with refugees suggests a more pragmatic, even transactional conception of the social welfare state, a sort of membership club in which people pay dues for expected services. If too many people get the benefits for free — especially people who stand out as different from the majority — faith in the system is imperiled.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Before, we got something back,” Mr. Grahn says. “Now, we’re not getting back what we paid for.”</p>',\n",

       " 'the-vietnam-war-was-already-lost-but-i-had-to-go-anyway': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In<!-- --> the summer of 1969, the first American troops were withdrawn from Vietnam. Their war was over, but mine was just beginning. The previous November, Richard M. Nixon had been elected president with a “secret plan” to end the war. Surely peace was near. That same month I received my draft notice. <!-- -->About 24,000<!-- --> of the more than 58,000 Americans killed in Vietnam were yet to die. I didn’t want to be one of them. No one did.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I had demonstrated against the war from the safety of my college deferment, so I thought of going to Canada. I also thought of getting a friendly doctor to say I had bone spurs or anxiety, but those choices would mean someone else from my refinery-town high school would have to go in my place.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By the time I arrived in Vietnam a year later, the rate of troop withdrawals had increased. But in Paris the peace talks were proceeding at a glacial speed. Hundreds of Americans and thousands of Vietnamese had died while the diplomats argued about the shape of the table. I was flown out to a platoon in the foothills of the Truong Son mountains, near where the Ho Chi Minh Trail fed North Vietnamese troops and supplies into the northern provinces of South Vietnam. We circled a blasted hilltop still smoldering from enemy mortars. Gaunt, tanned Marines in ragged fatigues moved slowly as they went about their morning rituals, heating C-ration meals and welcoming security teams back from their night positions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here’s what I wrote in a letter home back then<!-- -->: “<!-- -->I <!-- -->have 58 men. Only 20 have high school diplomas. Average age 19. Over and over I read: address of father: unknown; education: one or two years of high school; occupation: laborer, pecan sheller, gas station attendant, Job Corps. They had grown up in the ghetto or Appalachia or along the Rio Grande border or on a rez. Kids with no place to go. No place but here.” They were expendable, and they knew it. I was the clueless 24-year-old second lieutenant who had been put in charge of them. They couldn’t care less that I had a fancy degree from Oxford. They didn’t want to know if I would help them win the war. They knew it was already lost. They were wondering, would I get them killed, or not?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At night we took two-hour watches, <!-- -->Hiers my radio man and the others in our command foxhole<!-- -->. On my watch a call came in from battalion headquarters. Da Nang had been hit by 122-mm rockets. We were ordered to cross the river to find and kill the rocket team. I had just arrived, so to me the attack on Da Nang was like the bombing of Pearl Harbor. I summoned my squad leaders and gave them the order. They laughed. No. Way. Not for a few relatively harmless rockets disturbing the comfortable sleep of the Americans<!-- --> in the rear<!-- -->. Besides, the enemy owned the night. Even during the day, a river crossing was one of the most dangerous maneuvers we could do. In the dark, we stood zero chance of finding the men who had fired the rockets but a serious chance of men being killed, wounded, lost or drowned. Solution: <!-- -->We would do the mission only on the radio<!-- -->, but no one would move a muscle. As far as battalion headquarters knew, we withdrew from our position, crossed the river and discovered no rocketeers on the other side. It was a virtual mission. At first light, we did it for real.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This was the Marines. These kids weren’t afraid of a fight. They would have stormed the beaches at Iwo Jima. They would have given their buddies the last drop of water and their last C-ration. They would go out under fire to bring a buddy back to safety. They would give their lives for one another. No hesitation. But would they give their lives for the diplomatic benefit of Nixon and Henry Kissinger? At the order of some hard-charging major safely back at base, who was making the most of a six-month combat posting to feather his résumé? We would die for one another, but we didn’t want to die for nothing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In<!-- --> <!-- -->early <!-- -->1970, the Pentagon announced that the 26th Marine Regiment would be withdrawn in April. That was us! Everyone wrote home with the good news. We were going to live! Then we learned about what was known as <!-- -->the “Mixmaster” strategy.<!-- --> All of the Marines throughout Vietnam who were already set to go home were transferred into our regiment. All of us who had been there for less time were transferred out. With great ceremony the 26th went home, but few of the men who went with it had ever actually served in the regiment. The rest of us were dispersed all over Vietnam; we went home on our regular rotation dates or in body bags. “Xin loi,” we said, “Tough break, don’t mean nothing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s<!-- --> been <!-- -->50<!-- --> years, which means Vietnam is as far from me today as World War I, another war of dubious purpose, was from me then. I remember so much. The lush shades of green. The smells of mud and water buffalo and human excrement and burned flesh. The blood and the leeches and the music playing from eight-tracks before the sun set and we all wondered if we would see it rise. The laughter, too. The smell of cordite and the sound of an enemy mortar being launched at us and the shells from the big 16-inch guns roaring over us like subway trains. I remember the helicopters and the green AK-47 tracer bullets coming at us, and the body bags and the orphanage children burned alive by the Vietcong for having helped us. I remember the faces and the nicknames and the Freedom Bird calendars that marked the day we would fly out of this place, if it was the last thing we ever did. And for too many it was.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whenever<!-- --> I stand at the Vietnam memorial, I see their faces looking back at me. I wonder what their lives might have been like, what they might have done for the world, what kind of fathers they might have been. And I think the same about the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese who died on both sides, especially in those last six years after the peace talks began, when no one wanted to be the last to die for a lost cause.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I wished only that my own sons would not have to kill and die in such a senseless way. But after Sept. 11, my oldest son became a pararescueman, a Special Ops paramedic in the war we have been fighting for 18 years, as long as all of our 20-century wars combined. He was deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, Djibouti, Uzbekistan and elsewhere. I alternated between great pride and helpless fury. I had cold sweats from thinking the car coming up the driveway was the casualty detail telling me that he had been killed. It was only then that I realized my own parents must have gone through the same thing.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We learn nothing.</p>',\n",

       " 'the-worlds-fastest-old-man': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">PITTSBURGH — Charles Allie is 71 years old, and he is fast.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Chances are, he is a much faster runner than you are — faster, in fact, than you ever were. Last year in Spain he broke his own world record in his age group for the 400 meters by more than a second. That is essentially a quarter-mile, one lap around a standard running track. He crossed the tape in 57.26 seconds.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Plenty of people, even when they are at their fastest, never come close to running 400 meters in less than a minute. Allie has been breaking one minute since he was a child. Now, he beats his competitors — the other fastest men in the world who are his age — by 30 or 40 meters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He set the world record in the 200 meters for the over-70 group last year, too. Still not impressed? At the World Masters Athletics Championships, he dropped down an age division and won two relay gold medals with the 65-year-olds. In that division, he ran faster than just about everyone except his good friend Bill Collins, who was a top American runner in the mid-1970s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I’m just addicted to speed,” Allie said at the kitchen table in his Pittsburgh home on a recent morning. He had eaten oatmeal and fruit for breakfast.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Track and field is a sport of outliers. Sprinters weren’t supposed to be 6-foot-5. Then Usain Bolt of Jamaica rewrote the record books. Breaking two hours for the marathon was long considered impossible. Now Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya is within 99 seconds of the mark. Jackie Joyner-Kersee’s world record in the heptathlon has stood for 31 years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Allie is blessed with incredibly fast legs and a body that ages at a frighteningly slow rate. He said his weight has not fluctuated by more than five pounds in 25 years. He is rarely sick and has not had a major injury. He strained his Achilles\\' tendon <!-- -->in 2008. Right now, he said, he is dealing with achiness in his hip.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He is always training, but a little harder now. He wants to break the over-70 world record for the 100 meters, his weakest sprint event, this weekend at the masters national championships in Ames, Iowa. Last year he ran 12.81, missing the mark by four-hundreths of a second. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is nearly impossible for someone at any age to hold the world records for the 100, 200 and 400 simultaneously. Some have held two of the three. Bolt, for instance, has the records in the 100 and the 200. Michael Johnson held the record for the 200 and 400. But people who can win at 100 meters generally run out of gas before the end of a 400, and quarter-milers don’t have the raw speed required to win at 100 meters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He’s going to get it,” said Collins, Allie’s teammate with the track club Houston Elite. “He just has to work a little more on his start, those first 10 yards.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Collins, who is three years younger than Allie, describes him as “a once-in-a-generation athlete, kind of like Usain Bolt.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In 2013, Allie traveled to Monaco to accept the International Association of Athletics Federations’ award for male masters athlete of the year. Bolt was there, too, collecting the award for the senior athlete of the year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Being honored with him, that was something,” Allie said of Bolt.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Allie won city championships in high school in Pittsburgh. He attended Hampton University in Virginia, where he was a couple of clicks below national and world class. <!-- -->He competed in the occasional track meet in his 20s and 30s as he taught industrial arts and coached middle school sports.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then he turned 40 and began masters competition. He found that he had lost less speed than his contemporaries: The pack had come back to him, and even fallen behind.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Michael Joyner of the Mayo Clinic, a leading researcher of exercise and physiology, said Allie’s performances put him at the very edge of the aging curve, in which athletic performance declines at least 6 percent per decade. But given all the injuries sprinters are susceptible to, Allie’s crazy-slow fade is even more striking.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“When you are running seven- or eight-minute miles, you’re not exploding your legs the way these guys do,” Joyner said. “Clearly he stayed fit.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"> Allie eats healthfully and has run in the Penn Relays every year since he was 40. If he has two hard workouts in a row, he will take a day off.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I need my rest,” he said. He also visits a Y.M.C.A. for weight training a few afternoons a week, trying to ward off the inevitable decline of fast-twitch muscle fibers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Allie’s workouts are not long or complicated. He runs a slow mile to warm up. Then there are a series of 50-yard drills. Raising the knees high during one, making sure to whack his backside with his heel on every step during another. After that he takes a seat on the infield turf and laces up his track spikes. They are black Nikes, top of the line. It’s the thing he splurges on.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I like a shoe that makes me feel fast,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The spikes, which weigh just a few ounces, are for his sprint intervals. <!-- --> He will perform a series of intervals that are a little longer than his races. Preparing for a 400-meter race, he will repeat 500- or 600-meter intervals. For the 200, the distance is 250 or 300 meters. Since he is focused on <!-- -->the 100, he decided on a recent morning to do 150-meter sprints.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Running next to Allie can be a humbling experience. From the moment he starts, he just goes away, sprinting off, as if on air<!-- -->. Septuagenarians are not supposed to go this fast.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Collins, his teammate and sometime competitor, said there are few people who can carry their speed through an entire race the way Allie does. In the quarter-mile, Allie’s time for his last 100 meters is almost exactly the same as his first. It’s why his nickname is One Speed, Collins said. “He can be winning by 30 or 40 meters, and he still doesn’t slow down.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Allie’s wife, Jackie — they got together in middle school — films his races and posts them online. “I might be more into it than he is,” she said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That is a good thing because none of this comes cheap. Masters runners, even the best in the world, pay their own way, though U.S.A. Track &amp; Field recently started paying top runners $400 for each event at the world championships and $400 for each gold medal. The maximum payout in each age category is $1,000. Of course, Allie maxed out and collected $2,000 last year. They are given uniforms and other swag now, too.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Allie also coaches at Nadia, a track club in Pittsburgh. He said working with children, some as young as 6, helped keep him young.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">They call him Coach Buddy. They travel to Philadelphia to watch him compete in the Penn Relays. If he misses a workout in the morning, he laces up his spikes and runs with them. Like everyone else, they can’t believe how fast he is.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You have to push yourself to keep up with him,” Kamili Wiley, 13, said. “It’s crazy.”</p>',\n",

During May, the broad S&amp;P 500-stock index tumbled more than 4 percent as United States-China trade tensions rose, after the index reached a new high during April. By the end of June, the index jumped on a reported thaw in bilateral trade relations, with stocks in some sectors — such as technology and gambling — having one-day pops of as much as 6 percent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In early June, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.m-cam.com/innovationalphaindex/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Innovation Alpha Global E.T.F.</a> started operations. Run by MCAM International of Charlottesville, Va., the fund is based on an index that tracks 120 companies, focusing on the strength of their intellectual property and ties to “government patronage,” which the managers expect to insulate those shares from international trade battles.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The fund’s <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://etf.m-cam.com/inag\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">top holdings</a> include Adidas, a German shoe company; Bayer, a German pharmaceutical compay; Microsoft; and Kering, a French luxury goods maker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">This approach is not new, according to David Martin, founder and chief executive of MCAM. “While the timing of this particular E.T.F. appears quite fortuitous, it’s been around as a trading strategy for quite a long time,” Mr. Martin said. The underlying index has helped MCAM’s investing since 2001 and has been used in its hedge funds since 2005, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Martin said MCAM looked at nonfinancial disclosures — such as trade complaints and agreements — to ferret out companies likely to receive support from their national governments in a trade fight.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Part of the reason our strategy works is that we look at international trade as a global phenomenon, not a national one,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The fund made its debut on June 5. By the end of the month, it was up 5.2 percent compared to 6.9 percent for the S&amp;P 500. Mr. Martin also provided back test data — which may not reflect future returns — showing that the strategy has done well in the past.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Another approach is to invest in an E.T.F. that tracks emerging markets generally but excludes companies listed or domiciled in China and Hong Kong. Such a fund, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.columbiathreadneedleus.com/investment-products/exchange-traded-funds/Columbia-EM-Core-ex-China-ETF/XCEM/details/?cusip=19762B202&amp;_n=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Columbia EM Core ex-China</a> E.T.F., gained nearly 33 percent for the five years ending at the start of July, but it lagged the S&amp;P 500 index, which gained nearly 55 percent. Through June, the E.T.F. was up 12 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 gained about 17.3 percent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yet another China trade strategy is to seek bargains in beaten-down stocks and play for the potential bounce when the trade war wanes, said Dave Nadig, managing director of ETF.com. “You want to focus on portfolios that include Chinese A shares, the local shares sold on mainland China, which are the most depressed,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Nadig cited the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/ARCX/ASHR/quote.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares</a> E.T.F., based on an index of the 300 largest and most liquid stocks in the China A-Share market, which trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The index includes stocks that focus on Chinese consumers. Through June, the E.T.F. was up more than 30 percent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Sotiroff, the Morningstar analyst, suggested a longer-term strategy, based on E.T.F.s that provide broadly diversified exposure in emerging and developing markets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some examples are the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239626/ishares-msci-eafe-minimum-volatility-etf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol EAFE</a> E.T.F., which focuses on developed market equities (excluding the United States and Canada) with lower volatility characteristics, and the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239641/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-minimum-volatility-etf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol Emerging Markets</a> E.T.F., which invests in lower-volatility emerging markets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These are very well diversified, not single-industry bets, that you could hold for 10 or 15 years and get a good outcome,” he said. “Plus, both funds are very cheap compared with other options in those categories.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Through June, the developed markets fund was up more than 10 percent and the emerging markets fund was up almost 6 percent, compared with the S&amp;P 500’s gain of 17.3 percent, illustrating the trade-off among risk, return and stability.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For a value approach — geared to stocks that are cheaper than their peers — Mr. Sotiroff pointed to two funds. These are the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.schwabfunds.com/public/csim/home/products/exchange_traded_funds/summary.html?symbol=FNDF\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Schwab Fundamental International Large Company Index</a> E.T.F., focusing on developed markets excluding the United States, and the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.schwabfunds.com/public/csim/home/products/exchange_traded_funds/summary.html?symbol=FNDE\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Schwab Fundamental Emerging Markets Large Company Index</a> E.T.F.). The large company fund was up 11 percent through June; the emerging markets fund was up nearly 13 percent.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You’re buying companies that are cheaper, but they’re cheaper for a reason,” he said. These stocks tend to be out of favor with investors, and there’s no guarantee that will change. “They’re cheap but they’re risky.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Short-term tactics aimed at exploiting trade tensions are risky in themselves. Longer-term investing may make more sense for most people.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You don’t know what’s going to happen in these negotiations with tariffs and other countries,” Mr. Sotiroff warned. “Two years from now, we could have an administration in office with a completely different approach. Part of the game with investing is that you have to ride these things out once in a while. The main principle is staying invested and letting your returns compound.”</p>',\n",

       " 'tropical-storms-cyclones': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A tropical storm is expected to form over the northern Gulf of Mexico by Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said, prompting the city of New Orleans to begin closing flood gates, officials to warn residents and oil companies to start shutting down offshore platforms and coastal operations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Forecasters said the weather system is expected to keep gaining strength as it moves west, and become a hurricane on Friday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The storm, which would be the first tropical system to strike the United States this hurricane season, was south of the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday. Once its sustained winds reach or exceed 39 miles an hour, making it officially a tropical storm, it will be given the name Barry. Its expected path would bring it ashore in Louisiana or East Texas sometime on Saturday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The developing system was already causing widespread street flooding and power failures in New Orleans on Wednesday, including on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter. Water spouts formed near the city, and some neighborhoods received more than eight inches of rain in three hours.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The National Weather Service issued flash flood emergencies — its highest alert level for flooding — on Wednesday for Orleans and Jefferson parishes in Louisiana. The agency urged officials and residents along the Gulf Coast to review their hurricane plans, because of the threat of high winds and significant flooding from heavy rainfall and storm surge in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and East Texas.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana declared a state of emergency on Wednesday. “The system will likely produce storm surge, hurricane-force winds, and up to 15 inches of rain across the state,” he said. “This is going to be a Louisiana event that impacts every part of the state, and no one should take this storm lightly.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">National Guard troops and high-water vehicles will be stationed across the state to provide assistance, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mayor LaToya Cantrell of New Orleans said on Wednesday that she was not yet sure whether the city would call for voluntary or mandatory evacuations. At an afternoon news conference, she asked residents to shelter in place in the meantime.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Gulf region faces the threat of tropical storms and hurricanes every summer and fall, but there is an added complication this year. Heavy snowfall on the Great Plains over the winter and relentless rains in the spring have already swollen the region’s bayous and the Mississippi River and its tributaries, which drain to the Gulf. That has left the region’s levee systems with much less room than usual to absorb additional water.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With days of heavy rain on the way, the Mississippi River is expected to crest at New Orleans this weekend at close to 20 feet. The city’s levees along the river are between 20 and 25 feet high, according to Ricky Boyett, the spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers in the New Orleans District.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’ll be getting to the top of some of our lower levees if the forecast holds,” he said, cautioning that it was still early to lock in a prediction.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Boyett said the Army’s team of engineers was trying to identify any low areas and reinforce them. “We’re not concerned with integrity” of the levees, he said, only with how high the water rises.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hurricanes have struck Louisiana in July <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/philklotzbach/status/1148668924281495552\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">three times</a> in 168 years of record-keeping. All have occurred in the last 40 years. Experts say that trend can be attributed in part to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/climate/100000006101866/hurricane-florence-climate-change.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">climate change</a> warming the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">New Orleans has always been a place where heavy rains fell, but the inundations in recent days and what is expected from the latest storm are consistent with climate change’s effects: warmer air holds more moisture, which then comes down in the form of extremely heavy rainfall.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Loyola University New Orleans, which was flooded in spots on Wednesday, announced that it would cancel classes and close its campus on Thursday and Friday, as other colleges in the city have.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If this were occurring during the more crowded fall semester, we might try to stay open tomorrow,” Tania Tetlow, the president of Loyola, said in a statement to employees and students. “But I’m conscious of the fact that many of you are recovering from this morning and have work to do to get ready for the weather ahead.”</p>',\n",

       " 'trump-kidney-disease-transplant': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">President Trump issued a sweeping set of proposals aimed at improving medical care for the tens of millions of Americans who have kidney disease, a long-overlooked condition that kills more people than breast cancer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is a first, second and third step. It’s more than just a first step,” Mr. Trump said in a speech Wednesday, which was attended by patients, advocates and industry executives.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump signed an <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-advancing-american-kidney-health/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">executive order</a> directing federal agencies to educate and treat people with early forms of kidney disease, to make kidney transplants easier to get, and to shift the financial incentives for clinics and doctors away from the existing system that relies heavily on dialysis.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The result will be more and faster transplants for those in need,” said Mr. Trump, who also said his administration would work to encourage the development of new treatments like artificial kidneys. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“For 50 years, we have had basically a stagnant system of how we treat people with chronic kidney disease,” Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, said in a briefing held Wednesday morning. Mr. Azar has made kidney disease one of his priorities <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/secretary/speeches/2019-speeches/remarks-to-the-national-kidney-foundation.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">because his father needed dialysis</a> for several years and later received a kidney transplant.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump did not mention his <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/us/politics/melania-trump-kidney.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">wife’s kidney surgery last year</a>, and at the press briefing, White House officials did not answer a reporter’s question about whether Melania Trump was involved in these efforts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The president set an ambitious goal to remake how Americans with kidney disease get treated, by aggressively <!-- -->seeking to lower the costs<!-- --> by encouraging in-home dialysis and organ donation. Both options are seen as better treatment for patients than clinic-based dialysis. However, transforming the area may prove daunting, and many previous efforts have fallen short.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/publications-resources/2019-national-facts.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">About 37 million adults have chronic kidney disease</a>, or about 15 percent of American adults. Medicare, the federal health insurance program, covers about half a million people with end-stage kidney disease and spends disproportionately on their care. Although they are just 1 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.usrds.org/2018/view/v2_09.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">they account for 7 percent</a> of the program’s medical claims, some $35 billion. The total cost to Medicare for kidney care each year exceeds $100 billion.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Medicare has covered people who need dialysis since 1973, when the federal government took the unheard-of step of covering people with a single condition — end-stage renal disease — because they would not otherwise be able to afford care. Patients who need dialysis are hooked up to a machine that filters toxins from their blood three times a week, an onerous process that disrupts people’s lives and takes a heavy toll on their health. Half of the people who are on dialysis die within five years, according to federal officials. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In sharp contrast to treatments in areas like cancer or H.I.V., the main treatment for people with end-stage kidney disease — dialysis — has not changed much over the years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Dialysis has been a wonderful technology, but it has suffered from little innovation,” said Dr. John Sedor, a kidney specialist at the Cleveland Clinic who works with federal officials in a program to foster new developments. “It’s a government-run program that has discouraged private investment.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Officials said they wanted 80 percent of newly diagnosed people with end-stage kidney disease to be moved from clinic-based dialysis by the year 2025, and to reduce the number of Americans who develop end-stage disease by 25 percent before 2030. Today, only about 12 percent of Americans get dialysis at home, an amount that lags other countries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Trump administration wants to encourage living donors by <!-- -->adding reimbursements <!-- -->for lost wages and child care, as a way to double the number of kidneys available for transplant by 2030. Organs from living donors are considered the best option for people who need transplants, but they too require recuperative time. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We, in the United States, have too much in-center dialysis,” Mr. Azar said. “It is mentally and physically draining on you as an individual.” </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If the administration is successful, the initiative could lead to a shake-up of the dialysis industry, which is dominated by two companies, DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care. They operate about 70 percent of the country’s dialysis clinics. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In singling out kidney disease, Mr. Trump has taken on an issue widely seen as overdue for reform, and appears to be adding it to his list of health initiatives, a top priority for voters. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the speech, Mr. Trump emphasized the administration’s work to combat the opioid epidemic, the quest to end H.I.V. and said there would soon be more news on efforts to control drug prices. He also said he would protect people with pre-existing health conditions, just one day after administration lawyers joined several states and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/health/obamacare-appeals-court.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">argued before an appellate court that the Affordable Care Act should be overturned. </a></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some of his efforts to address health care issues have faltered. On Monday, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/health/drug-prices-tv-ads-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a federal judge threw out</a> a key component of the president’s drug-pricing plan, one that would have required pharmaceutical companies to disclose the price of their drugs in television advertisements. And Mr. Trump has largely abandoned efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act through Congress.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His<!-- --> decision to focus on kidney care was met with a mix of surprise and praise.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are very optimistic and excited that there is great attention at the presidential level,” Tonya Saffer, the vice president for health policy at the National Kidney Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group, said in an interview before the announcement. “It’s really been four decades since anybody has paid attention to this space in a very meaningful way.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It’s unclear how many of the initiatives announced Wednesday were new. Many proposals have been in the works for months, or represent the evolution of programs that were already underway. In March, top Trump health officials, including Mr. Azar, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/secretary/speeches/2019-speeches/remarks-to-the-national-kidney-foundation.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">outlined steps the administration was taking to improve kidney treatment,</a> including streamlining the process for organ transplants and improving financial incentives for patients to use in-home dialysis.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a twist, a major of aspect of their initiative would rely on an innovation center <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicare/fact-sheet/what-is-cmmi-and-11-other-faqs-about-the-cms-innovation-center/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">created under the Affordable Care Act</a>, which President Trump has vehemently opposed. The proposal would create pilot programs to test alternate ways of reimbursing physicians to encourage treatment of kidney disease earlier and potentially avoid the need for dialysis. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is the needed paradigm shift for the United States,” Dr. Brigitte Schiller, the chief medical officer for Satellite Healthcare, a nonprofit chain of dialysis centers, said in an interview before the announcement. The current system “makes it very easy to send a patient to the centers.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the United States, the rates of kidney transplants and in-home dialysis has lagged<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.usrds.org/2018/view/v2_11.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"> those in other developed countries</a>, a situation that many say can be blamed on a host of financial incentives that discourage better options.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Companies that operate clinics, such as DaVita and Fresenius, profit from recurring visits by patients coming to their centers. In addition, many kidney specialists, or nephrologists, have a financial interest in dialysis centers in their communities, either by serving as the clinics’ medical directors or owning a stake through a joint venture with a dialysis operator.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“One of the fundamental challenges is the fact that physicians don’t make their money treating kidney disease; they make money on dialysis,” Arvind Rajan, a co-founder and chief executive of Cricket Health, a San Francisco start-up that is focusing on kidney care, said before the announcement. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Changing the incentives “is sorely necessary,” added Mr. Rajan, who said private insurers that are paying for kidney care have already begun trying to shift more people to home or to consider transplants. “The landscape has changed really quickly,” he said. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While policy experts praised the president’s efforts, many also cautioned that significant change would not be easy. Many people with end-stage kidney disease are coping with other serious health conditions or are facing other problems, such as a lack of resources or support that may make it hard to take advantage of alternative treatments.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Although the big chains have also begun selling in-home dialysis services, they have invested heavily in their brick-and-mortar centers, Dr. Graham Abra, a specialist at Stanford University, said before the president’s speech. “There’s an incentive if you build a center to fill it, and push that,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">DaVita and Fresenius said in separate statements that they welcomed the president’s attention to this area, that they were already investing in alternatives to traditional dialysis, and encouraged patients to pursue the best options for their health.</p>',\n",

       " 'trump-social-media-summit': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Trolling on the internet was once a thankless pastime. Make edgy jokes on the right message board, get your sarcastic memes noticed by the right people, and you might score some retweets and Reddit upvotes, but that was about the extent of it.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For today’s right-wing trolls, though, there is a bigger prize on the table: a red-carpet visit to the White House.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On Thursday, President Trump is assembling a group of his most ardent online supporters for a White House “social media summit.” The guest list has not been publicly released, but a motley grab bag of pro-Trump influencers have taken to Twitter to brag about their invitations, including James O’Keefe, the right-wing founder of Project Veritas; Bill Mitchell, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/1146139867459522560\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a pro-Trump activist</a> who has promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory; and a pseudonymous Twitter user, “CarpeDonktum,” who is perhaps best known for <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/opinion/internet-meme-joe-biden-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">creating a doctored video</a> of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that Mr. Trump retweeted.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The group will have “a robust conversation on the opportunities and challenges of today’s online environment,” according to Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, who <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/07/09/business/09reuters-usa-socialmedia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">said last month</a> that Mr. Trump would speak at the summit. Conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and Turning Point USA have also said they would attend.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The meeting’s guest list has been a hot topic among the often-fractious online right. Several right-wing influencers have complained about not being invited, including Laura Loomer, an <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/willsommer/status/1146062373909716993\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">activist</a> who has been barred by Twitter and Facebook. Ben Garrison, a pro-Trump cartoonist, was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2019/07/10/new-wh-says-cartoonist-is-no-longer-attending-social-media-summit-455141\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">originally scheduled to attend</a>, but the White House rescinded his invitation this week, according to Politico, after critics accused him of drawing an anti-Semitic cartoon.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The summit illuminates the rising influence of online tastemakers within the political establishment. But it also has the makings of a West Wing pity party. Right-wing internet personalities, including Mr. Trump himself, have accused social media companies of being biased against them. Recently, Mr. Trump suggested that Twitter “should be sued because of what’s happening with the bias,” and in May, the White House released a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18626785/white-house-trump-censorsip-tool-twitter-instagram-facebook-conservative-bias-social-media\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">“share your story” tool</a> to collect anecdotes from people who feel their social media accounts have been banned unfairly.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Twitter and Facebook were not invited to the White House to defend themselves, two people familiar with the companies’ plans said. But executives from both companies have denied targeting conservatives because of their political views. (Whether some of their rules, like prohibitions on targeted harassment and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2019/hatefulconductupdate.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">dehumanizing language</a>, have a disproportionate impact on accounts that support the president is another matter.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In reality, few have benefited more from the megaphones provided by these platforms than Mr. Trump and his supporters. Right-wing pages are among the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/research/2018/07/16/study-analysis-top-facebook-pages-covering-american-political-news/220671\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">most popular political news outlets</a> on Facebook, and Mr. Trump remains one of Facebook’s biggest clients. Since May 2018, his re-election campaign has <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/archive/report\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">purchased</a> more than $10 million worth of Facebook ads, more than any other candidate or group.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Some experts believe that by rallying his supporters around bias claims, Mr. Trump is trying to work the referees ahead of the 2020 election, and intimidate social media companies out of enforcing their rules. Those rules, which include steps taken after the 2016 election to reduce the spread of misinformation and hateful content, have resulted in bans and takedowns for a number of high-profile conservatives.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The summit agenda is clearly political,” said Jennifer Grygiel, a professor at Syracuse University who studies social media. “The president wants the platforms to serve his political agenda, and recent changes have reduced the amount of influence available to him.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump may also be betting that the success of his 2020 re-election bid will hinge, at least in part, on the enthusiasm of his highest-profile internet supporters. In 2016, a “meme army” <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/josephbernstein/this-man-helped-build-the-trump-meme-army-and-now-he-wants-t\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">rose from the depths</a> of 4chan and Reddit to support Mr. Trump’s candidacy by turning out a steady stream of pro-Trump images, videos and animation — the best of which were often shared by Mr. Trump and his inner circle on social media. Since his election, Mr. Trump has continued to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/04/technology/jobs-not-mobs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">look to his internet supporters</a> as a kind of crowdsourced media consultancy, from which he draws slogans, video mash-ups and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-s-game-thrones-inspired-tweet-was-equivalent-five-super-n996431\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">“Game of Thrones”-inspired</a> memes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think the White House social media summit is an opportunity to say thank you for the community that has been at the president’s side these last three years and enlist their help in the fights to come,” said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the past, politicians have kept their internet fandoms at arm’s length. But as amateur media proves more effective at engaging voters online than slick, overproduced campaign ads, these efforts are increasingly being solicited by the candidates themselves.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The stuff online that people dismiss as memes — that’s the way to motivate people,” CarpeDonktum, the pro-Trump memesmith, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/06/opinion/internet-meme-joe-biden-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">told my colleague Charlie Warzel this year</a>. “It’s the viral political marketing of the future.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Democrats have also embraced the gritty, lo-fi aesthetic of internet memes. Mike Gravel, the former Alaska senator who is among the Democratic candidates for president, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/magazine/mike-gravel-teens-twitter-presidential-campaign.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">turned over his social media accounts</a> to teenage supporters, whose pro-Gravel memes have made him a cult favorite online. Andrew Yang, the businessman who is running for the Democratic nomination on a platform of universal basic income, has <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/technology/andrew-yang-internet-democratic-primary.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">tapped his online supporters</a>, known as the “Yang Gang,” for catchphrases and campaign ideas. Other Democratic candidates have been experimenting with Instagram-ready moments — Elizabeth Warren’s <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/why-elizabeth-warrens-beer-moment-fell-flat/579544/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">kitchen beers</a>, Beto O’Rourke’s <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/10/beto-orourke-went-dentist-brought-his-instagram-followers-with-him/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">dental appointment</a> — with varying success.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump’s use of internet imagery is cruder than most. Last month, reporters began noticing that his re-election campaign had been using <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/JuddLegum/status/1144334983722622978\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">stock photo images</a> in its targeted social media ads, including an <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/aarontmak/status/1146070381364690944\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">ad featuring images</a> of a “small American business” that turned out to be a storefront in Tokyo.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Fidelity to the facts, of course, has never been a hallmark of meme culture. A bigger worry for Mr. Trump, as his re-election campaign heats up, is that some of the largest repositories of pro-Trump internet content are drying up. Reddit’s largest pro-Trump forum, known as r/the_donald, was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/us/politics/reddit-donald-trump-quarantined.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">quarantined</a> by moderators last month after users were found to be making threats against police officers and public officials. 8chan, a message board known as a hotbed of alt-right vitriol, was served with <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/poway-synagogue-shooting-8chan-served-search-warrant-for-alleged-shooters-posts-data-on-other-users\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">an F.B.I. search warrant in April</a>, in response to evidence that the suspect in the Poway, Calif., synagogue shooting had been inspired by posts he saw there. And a number of Trump-supporting internet figures were barred by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/02/facebook-alex-jones-laura-loomer-ban/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Facebook</a> and Instagram this year for violating its policy against “dangerous individuals and organizations.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">These moves seem to have re-energized pro-Trump internet influencers in recent months, by uniting them around a shared concern over censorship.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is ironic, of course, to complain about being persecuted from the cushy perch of a White House summit. And it reflects the shifting attitudes toward power that many pro-Trump internet influencers have had to adopt since Mr. Trump’s election, as they have gone from being anti-establishment mischief-makers to a state-sanctioned cheering section.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whatever else it does, the White House’s social media function may serve the valuable purpose of shifting attention from the halls of Washington, where Mr. Trump holds ultimate power, to the platforms of Silicon Valley, where he doesn’t. The internet, after all, still loves an underdog.</p>',\n",

       " 'uk-parliament-sexual-harassment': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">LONDON — A blistering report on the House of Commons in Britain said on Thursday that people working for members of Parliament faced “an unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment” but often remained silent because complaining, even under a new grievance procedure, amounted to “career suicide.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The investigation, led by Gemma White, a lawyer, called for “a fundamental shift away from regarding members of Parliament as ‘650 small businesses’ with near complete freedom to operate in relation to their staff.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the report, people working for lawmakers said their tenure was almost unbearable, with one employee describing it as “the most stressful and hostile period of my life.” Another said that sexual harassment was “a necessary evil” for young, ambitious workers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The study said that instances of sexual harassment were “often accompanied by touching, sometimes forceful.” The complaints came not just from “bright-eyed young graduates coming to Parliament to live the ‘dream’ and having high expectations shattered,” the report said, but from workers with prior experience in private business.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The findings lifted the lid on the sometime punishing hallways of Parliament, where staff members work directly for lawmakers with scant oversight. Those surveyed said they were sometimes left helpless and in tears because of chronic mistreatment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Almost immediately, the leader of the House of Commons, Mel Stride, announced that lawmakers would be asked next week to approve one of the changes recommended in the report: allowing former staff members, in addition to current ones, to file complaints.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the report said the entire system of lawmakers’ teams operating as fiefs needed to be overhauled.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The House of Commons Commission, which is responsible for the administration and services of the chamber, said in a statement that it took “very seriously its responsibility to ensure that Parliament is a modern workplace,” even though the staff members interviewed for the report worked directly for lawmakers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We condemn bullying and harassment of M.P.s’ staff and offer our full support to anyone in the parliamentary community who has suffered in this way,” the statement said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The revelations in the inquiry mirrored those in a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/house-of-lords-commission/2017-19/ellenbogen-report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">separate report a day earlier about the House of Lords</a>, the upper house of Parliament, whose members are largely appointed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">That report described a culture of bullying and harassment that had taken hold in an ossified workplace, where white men held many of the most senior staff posts and victims widely believed that complaining would only do them harm.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One member of the House of Lords took to grabbing the backside of a female clerk while he passed through the crowded lobby where lawmakers vote, the report said. So pervasive was misconduct that staff members avoided being in rooms alone with one lawmaker — “a notorious bullying pervert” — or even rearranged the office furniture so another “would stop leaning over to look down your shirt.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Twenty percent of staff members said that they had been bullied or harassed at work within the last year, the report on the House of Lords said. The fact that so many staff members work their entire careers in the Lords, resigned to low pay and fearful of their superiors, has frozen the institution in its old ways, the report said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Staff can become institutionalized, bad habits can become entrenched, poor behavior can go unchecked, urban myths can develop and beliefs which may once have been justified can survive and flourish when no longer warranted,” the report said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Both inquiries were commissioned in the aftermath of a scathing <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/world/europe/uk-parliament-abuse-harassment-report.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">report in October on the House of Commons</a> that said complaints of mistreatment there were typically muffled by “deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Complaints about harassment in the British Parliament have dribbled out for years, but the dam broke following <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/business/harvey-weinstein-settlement.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">accusations of sexual misconduct by the Hollywood power broker Harvey Weinstein</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Inspired by the #MeToo movement, women working in Parliament made allegations that ranged from unwanted touching and sexual remarks to kissing and groping.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Around a dozen lawmakers came under investigation. The first secretary of state, Damian Green, a close ally of Prime Minister Theresa May, was found to have breached the ministerial code of conduct and was forced to resign after an investigation found that he misled the public about <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/world/europe/theresa-may-damian-green-britain-pornography-scandal.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">pornography found on his parliamentary computer</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The problem owed in part to the apparent view of lawmakers that they were above workplace oversight. Employees had no independent personnel body to complain to. Instead, they were sent to the party whips, political enforcers who were said to stockpile the complaints to use as leverage against lawmakers in future votes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The new grievance procedure, introduced last summer, drew up specific rules about behavior in Parliament and created independent help lines for reporting abuse. But <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/Conduct%20in%20Parliament/ICGS%20six-month%20review%20-%20FINAL%20REPORT.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">a review released in May</a> found that, while the system was an achievement, “the amount of work and procedural complexity to effectively implement and operate the scheme was substantially underestimated.”</p>',\n",

Without concerted action, a United Nations <!-- -->panel <!-- -->said, resistant infections could kill 10 million people annually by 2050 and trigger an economic slowdown to rival the global financial crisis of 2008.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The problem threatens people around the world. During the next 30 years, the United Nations experts said, 2.4 million people in Europe, North America and Australia could die from drug-resistant infections, making routine hospital procedures like knee-replacement surgery and childbirth far riskier than they are today.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is a silent tsunami,” said Dr. Haileyesus Getahun, director of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/en/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">U.N. Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance</a>, which spent two years working on the report. “We are not seeing the political momentum we’ve seen in other public health emergencies, but if we don’t act now, antimicrobial resistance will have a disastrous impact within a generation.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The group, a collaboration of public health experts, government ministers and industry officials, called for the creation of an independent body with the stature and funding of the United Nations’ panel on climate change.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The report’s dire predictions seek to raise public awareness and shake political leaders into action. It proposes a series of measures that health officials say could help stem the rise of drug-resistant pathogens. The recommendations include a worldwide ban on the use of medically important antibiotics for promoting growth in farm animals; financial incentives for drug companies to develop new antimicrobial compounds; and more stringent rules to limit the sale of antibiotics in countries where drugs can often be bought at convenience stores without a prescription.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[Read our series </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/deadly-germs-lost-cures?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Deadly Germs, Lost Cures</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The report also highlights underappreciated factors in the spread of drug-resistant germs: the lack of clean water and inadequate sewage systems that sicken millions of people in the developing world. Many of them are too poor to see a doctor and instead buy <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/health/antibiotic-resistance-kenya-drugs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">cheap antibiotics from street vendors</a> with little medical expertise. Sometimes they unknowingly purchase counterfeit drugs, a problem that leads to millions of deaths, most of them in Africa.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To reduce outbreaks of infectious disease, the report says, wealthier nations should help poor countries pay for improvements to public hygiene, and ensure greater access to vaccines and properly manufactured antibiotics.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Health officials are struggling to understand the scope of the problem because many countries are ill-equipped to monitor drug-resistant infections. In a survey the United Nations conducted for the report, 39 of 146 nations were unable to provide data on the use of antimicrobials in animals, which experts say is a major driver of resistance in humans <!-- -->as resistant bacteria get transferred to people through contaminated food and water.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are flying pretty blind and working hard to get some clear vision,” said Sally Davies, the chief medical officer of England and a leader of the United Nations panel.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As a first step, the report calls on member states of the United Nations to create national stewardship plans to reduce the unnecessary use of antimicrobials.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A key element of the report is a call for new incentives to encourage the development of antimicrobial medicines. Between 2010 and 2014, six new antimicrobial drugs were approved, most of them additions to existing drug classes, according to the World Health Organization. By contrast, 19 new <!-- -->antimicrobial<!-- --> drugs were approved between 1980 and 1984.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The dearth of new drugs is tied to the perverse economics of antimicrobial resistance and the free market. It can cost a half-billion dollars to develop a new compound, but doctors are discouraged from using the drugs to reduce the possibility that the targeted pathogens will become resistant. Even when doctors prescribe the drugs, most patients take them for a week or two, limiting a drug company’s ability to earn back its initial investment. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Everyone agrees that there is an absolute need for new antibiotics but there is no sustainable market,” said Thomas Cueni, director general of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ifpma.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &amp; Associations</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Incentives to develop new drugs could include generous government financing for research, or regulatory changes that would increase reimbursements for newly approved antibiotics considered medically important. According to the World Bank, such investments would quickly pay for themselves; it notes that containing antimicrobial resistance costs $9 billion annually.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I applaud the U.N. for at least putting incentives on the map, but there needs to be more than talk,” said Mr. Cueni, who also chairs the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.amrindustryalliance.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">AMR Industry Alliance</a>, a trade group working to address the problem of antimicrobial resistance. “What’s needed is money.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Still, many public health advocates said the report was an important step in elevating a crisis that has failed to garner the attention of other global problems like climate change and AIDS. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lance Price, director of the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://battlesuperbugs.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Antibiotic Resistance Action Center</a> at George Washington University, said he worried the report might not gain much traction with the Trump administration, which has been averse to multilateral cooperation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Fear, he said, was the key to changing the status quo.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Even if you don’t care about the suffering of people who drink unclean water and get resistant infections, you still have to recognize that these bacteria don’t recognize international borders,” he said. “They will come here, and they will kill us. We have to let people know that the problem is closer than they think.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></strong><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">| Sign up for the </em><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></strong></p>',\n",

       " 'us-france-tariffs': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would investigate whether a French plan to impose a tax on American technology giants like Facebook and Google amounts to an unfair trade practice that could be punished with retaliatory tariffs, escalating its global trade fight.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The investigation, to be carried out by the United States trade representative, is the latest attempt by the Trump administration to shelter American companies, particularly in tech, by taking a more aggressive stance toward allies’ trading practices.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is likely to further stoke tensions with the European Union, which President Trump has already threatened with auto tariffs and criticized for selling more goods to the United States than it purchases. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said the European Union is worse than China when it comes to trade practices and has lashed out at its top antitrust regulator, Margrethe Vestager, saying she has unfairly targeted Google, Apple and other American companies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The American action announced on Wednesday is aimed at France, which has moved independently from the European Union to seek a tax on technology companies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">France has proposed a 3 percent tax on the revenues some companies earn from providing digital services to French users, a measure that will target Facebook, Google, Amazon and others whose businesses focus on digital advertising and e-commerce.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">French officials expect the annual tax bill for these companies to amount to about 500 million euros, or about $563 million. French lawmakers <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.senat.fr/ordre-du-jour/ordre-du-jour.html#jeudi_11_juillet_2019\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">are scheduled</a> to vote as early as Thursday on the measure, which applies to digital businesses with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros. France’s General Assembly passed the bill last week, and now it is in the Senate’s hands.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">France and other European countries have long been frustrated that digital platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon use financial structures and subsidiaries in low-tax areas to avoid paying taxes in their countries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The European Commission estimates that digital companies pay an <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/factsheet_digital_taxation_21032018_en.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">average effective tax rate</a> of 9.5 percent, compared with the roughly 23 percent paid by traditional businesses.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s time for these companies to pay the taxes that they owe,” Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/france-tax-tech-companies.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">said in December</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">French leaders have said the new tax would target companies in Europe and Asia, not just the United States.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">European authorities have been the world’s most aggressive regulators of the tech industry — and a persistent source of friction with Washington — penalizing American companies for anticompetitive behavior, tax avoidance and privacy lapses. In 2016, the European Commission ordered Apple to repay $14.5 billion in owed taxes to Ireland, a decision now under appeal, and Google has been fined three separate times for antitrust violations. Last month, Mr. Trump lashed out at Ms. Vestager, saying she unfairly targets American companies. “She’s suing all our companies,” he said on Fox Business Network. “They make it very — almost impossible to do two-way business.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The European Union has tried to put together a more unified digital tax plan covering the 28-nation bloc, but leaders <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/technology/france-tax-tech-companies.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">could not reach an agreement</a>, prompting France to act on its own. Leaders in Spain and Britain have proposed similar measures.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has also tried to work out a deal among countries about taxes from digital companies, but the slow pace of the talks has frustrated European nations.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In a statement, the United States trade representative said that the French tax targeted services “where U.S. firms are global leaders,” suggesting that “France is unfairly targeting the tax at certain U.S.-based technology companies.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The tax treats companies that pay French corporate income tax differently than those that do not, meaning that it falls more heavily on foreign companies, according to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/france-digital-services-tax/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">an analysis by the Tax Foundation</a>, which found that the tax works much like a tariff on foreign goods.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The design of this new tax suggests it was tailored specifically to impose a financial burden on successful U.S. companies,” said Jake Colvin, the vice president for global trade and innovation at the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents American exporters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The investigation will be carried out under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a legal provision that gives the president broad authority to retaliate against trading partners. It is the same mechanism Mr. Trump has used to impose sweeping tariffs on China, as well as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/enforcement/301Investigations/Preliminary_Product_List.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">propose countermeasures</a> against the European Union for allegedly subsidizing Airbus, the French aircraft manufacturer.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The measure will open yet another front in a global trade fight that the Trump administration says it has undertaken to level the playing field with both allies and adversaries. In his dealings with China, the European Union, Mexico, Canada, Japan and other countries, Mr. Trump has repeatedly turned to tariffs, viewing them as the best way to push trading partners to change their practices.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Robert Lighthizer, the Trump administration’s top trade negotiator, said in a statement that the United States was “very concerned that the digital services tax which is expected to pass the French Senate tomorrow unfairly targets American companies.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The president has directed that we investigate the effects of this legislation and determine whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce,” Mr. Lighthizer said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Major American tech companies, which opposed the French tech tax, cheered the investigation. Jordan Haas, the director of trade policy for the Internet Association, which represents the American industry, said the inquiry was “an important step in exercising American leadership to stem the tide of new discriminatory taxes across Europe.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Facebook and Google declined to comment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lawmakers in the United States have also been critical of France’s push to tax tech companies.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The digital services tax that France and other European countries are pursuing is clearly protectionist and unfairly targets American companies in a way that will cost U.S. jobs and harm American workers,” Senators Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said in a joint statement.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have urged the administration to consider all available tools to address this discriminatory action and applaud the U.S. trade representative for launching an investigation,” the senators said.</p>',\n",

       " 'us-iran-nuclear-sanctions': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">BRUSSELS — The United States on Wednesday <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://vienna.usmission.gov/special-iaea-board-of-governors-meeting-on-iran-u-s-statement/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">accused Iran </a>of “nuclear extortion” and threatened further sanctions against Tehran, which has begun stockpiling and enriching uranium beyond the limits set in the 2015 accord that President Trump has abandoned.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The United States called an emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna on Wednesday in response to the Iranian moves, while a senior French envoy was in Tehran exploring ways to reopen negotiations on compliance with the deal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Both Iran and the United States insist that they are open to further negotiations, but both have put different conditions on new talks. Washington insists that they must prevent Iran’s development of a weapons program and restrict Iran’s involvement with regional allies, while Iran insists that Washington must first rejoin the deal Mr. Trump renounced in 2018 and remove sanctions that are strangling Iranian oil exports.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the Vienna meeting, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://vienna.usmission.gov/special-iaea-board-of-governors-meeting-on-iran-u-s-statement/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the American ambassador, Jackie Wolcott, said </a> that “there is no credible reason for Iran to expand its nuclear program, and there is no way to read this as anything other than a crude and transparent attempt to extort payments from the international community.” The only path to sanctions relief, she said, is “through negotiations, not nuclear extortion.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Later Wednesday, President Trump <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1148958770770382849\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">wrote on Twitter</a> that sanctions against Iran would soon be “increased substantially” and charged that “Iran has long been secretly ‘enriching,’ in total violation” of the 2015 deal.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was not clear on what basis Mr. Trump made that charge. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which conducts a strict inspection of Iran’s nuclear program under the deal, has discovered no secret enrichment program.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Iran’s ambassador to the agency, Kazim Gharib Abadi, responded to Mr. Trump by saying in Vienna that all Iran’s nuclear activities are monitored by the agency, and “we have nothing to hide.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Iran has repeatedly stated it does not want nuclear weapons. It has moved carefully beyond the enrichment limits of the deal in response to the American reimposition of sanctions and especially Washington’s decision in late April to end the waivers it had given eight countries to continue to buy Iranian oil.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The decision was made against the advice of the State Department, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/us-and-iran-shape-new-deal/59359\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">according to a former diplomat,</a> Dennis Ross, who said it favored longer-term pressure on Iran while trying to keep the country inside the limits of the deal. But since the decision, Iran’s oil exports, on which much of the economy depends, have fallen from roughly a million barrels a day to roughly 300,000.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Iran says that it will further increase uranium enrichment and take other unspecified steps that will not be reversed until it achieves “full rights” under the deal. Iran has demanded that the other participants — Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and the European Union — satisfy their obligations to aid Iran’s economy.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But American sanctions, which threaten punishment against countries that do business with Iran, have made trade almost impossible.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">While China continues to buy some Iranian oil, the Europeans have instead created a barter system for trade that aims to bypass restrictions on dollar-denominated transactions imposed by the American sanctions. But the barter system, known as Instex, has not yet completed its first transaction. And it has been heavily criticized by Iranian officials as no substitute for the surge in business they had expected under the nuclear agreement. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called Instex <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13980102000053\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">“a bitter joke.”</a></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Vienna, the Europeans issued a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/2019-07_-09_-_eu_statement_on_iran_-_final.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">joint statement </a>that called on Iran to resume full compliance with the deal “without delay.” It expressed regret over American abandonment of the deal but emphasized again that European “commitment to the nuclear deal, including sanctions lifting for the benefit of the Iranian people, depends on full compliance by Iran.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the same time, the Europeans gave no indication of how long they would wait before beginning a process of dispute resolution under the deal, which could lead, after a month or more of further talks, to the reimposition of European sanctions on Iran.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Iran is clearly trying to calibrate its moves to avoid that outcome, trapping the Europeans between Washington and Tehran.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">France has been particularly tough on Iran, wanting to ensure nuclear nonproliferation, but also wanting to bring Washington back into talks and calm the issue down before it leads to military conflict.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The French presidential envoy, Emmanuel Bonne, met Wednesday with key Iranian figures. Ali Shamkhani, head of Iran’s national security council, told him that the country’s decision to reduce its nuclear commitments “step by step” is an “unchangeable strategy,” according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, and he went on to criticize European countries for their “lack of will” in providing relief from American sanctions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But President Hassan Rouhani of Iran told Mr. Bonne that “Iran has fully left the path open for diplomacy and negotiation,” according to the presidential website. Mr. Rouhani said that Iran seeks “full implementation” of commitments by all parties. “If signatories to the deal implement their commitments, Iran also will take new steps.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Last week Mr. Rouhani also said that Iran’s actions thus far were fully reversible, saying: “All our actions can be returned to the previous condition within one hour.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The diplomatic maneuverings reflected Iran’s efforts to pressure the Europeans to deliver more economic benefits and Washington to rejoin the nuclear agreement and lift sanctions. Iran has not yet said what further actions it may take, though it promises more in early September if conditions do not change.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Ross, the former American official, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/us-and-iran-shape-new-deal/59359\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">suggested in an article in the Atlantic</a> that productive talks could revolve around Iran agreeing to extend time limits for another 10 or 15 years on its compliance with the deal and limiting its arms exports to allies in the region while the United States would lift sanctions and agree to a special trading system whereby American and foreign firms could do business in Iran subject to a set of regulations.</p>',\n",

       " 'venezuela-economy': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">MARACAIBO, Venezuela — Zimbabwe’s collapse under Robert Mugabe. The fall of the Soviet Union. Cuba’s disastrous unraveling in the 1990s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/world/americas/venezuela-russia-economy.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FVenezuela&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">crumbling of Venezuela’s economy</a> has now outpaced them all.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Venezuela’s fall is the single largest economic collapse outside of war in at least 45 years, economists say.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s really hard to think of a human tragedy of this scale outside civil war,” said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. “This will be a touchstone of disastrous policies for decades to come.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To find similar levels of economic devastation, economists at the I.M.F. pointed to countries that were ripped apart by war, like Libya earlier this decade or Lebanon in the 1970s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Venezuela, at one point Latin America’s wealthiest country, has not been shattered by armed conflict. Instead, economists say, the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/14/world/americas/venezuela-collapse-analysis-interpreter.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">poor governance, corruption and misguided policies</a> of President Nicolás Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, have fueled runaway inflation, shuttered businesses and brought the country to its knees. And in recent months, the Trump administration has imposed stiff sanctions to try to cripple it further.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the country’s economy plummeted, armed gangs took control of entire towns, public services collapsed and the purchasing power of most Venezuelans has been reduced to a couple of kilograms of flour a month.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In markets, butchers hit by regular blackouts jostle to sell decomposing stock by sunset. Former laborers scavenge through garbage piles for leftovers and recyclable plastic. Dejected retailers make dozens of trips to the bank in hopes of depositing several pounds’ worth of bills made worthless by hyperinflation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Here in Maracaibo, a city of two million on the border with Colombia, nearly all of the butchers in the main market have stopped selling meat cuts in favor of offal and leftovers like fat shavings and cow hooves, the only animal protein many of their customers can still afford.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The crisis has been compounded by American sanctions intended to force Mr. Maduro to cede power to the nation’s opposition leader, Juan Guaidó. The Trump administration’s recent <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/politics/venezuela-sanctions-trump-oil.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">sanctions on Venezuela’s state oil company</a> have made it difficult for the government to sell its main commodity, oil. Together with the American ban on trading Venezuelan bonds, the administration has made it harder for Venezuela to import any goods, including food and medication.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Maduro blames the widespread <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/17/world/americas/venezuela-children-starving.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">hunger</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/world/americas/venezuela-patients-hospital.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">lack of medical supplies</a> on the United States and its opposition allies — but most independent economists say the recession began years before the sanctions, which at most accelerated the collapse.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We are fighting a savage battle against international sanctions that have made Venezuela lose at least $20 billion in 2018,” Mr. Maduro told supporters in a recent speech. “They are pursuing our bank accounts, our purchases abroad of any products. It’s more than a blockade, it’s persecution.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Shortages have sunk much of the population in a deepening humanitarian crisis, though a core group of military top brass and high-level officials who remain loyal to Mr. Maduro are able to tap into the remaining resources to survive — or <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-hezbollah-drugs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">even enrich themselves through illicit means</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">To many, it seems each month brings record lows.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. But its oil output, once Latin America’s largest, has fallen faster in the past year than Iraq’s after the American invasion in 2003, according to data from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Venezuela has lost a tenth of its population in the past two years as people fled, even <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/americas/venezuela-refugees-colombia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">trekking across mountains</a>, setting off Latin America’s biggest ever refugee crisis.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Venezuela’s hyperinflation, expected to reach 10 million percent this year according to the I.M.F., is on track to become the longest period of runaway price rises since that in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 1990s.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is essentially a total collapse in consumption,” said Sergi Lanau, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a financial trade association.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The institute estimates that the drop in Venezuela’s economic output under Mr. Maduro has undergone the steepest decline by any country not at war since at least 1975.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By year’s end, Venezuela’s gross domestic product will have shrunk by 62 percent since the beginning of the recession in 2013, which coincided with Mr. Maduro coming to power, according to the finance institute’s estimates. (Venezuela’s government hasn’t released official macroeconomic statistics since 2014, forcing economists to rely on indicators like imports to estimate economic activity.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">By contrast, the median economic decline in the former Soviet republics was about 30 percent during the peak of the crisis in the mid-1990s, the institute calculates.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For now, the government is concentrating its scarce resources in the capital, Caracas. But the state’s presence is melting in the hinterlands, an absence that has been particularly glaring in Zulia, Venezuela’s most populous state.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Caribbean Sea</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">TOAS I.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">Maracaibo</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">Caracas</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">Machiques</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">ZULIA</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">venezuela</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">colombia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">brazil</p><p class=\"g-pstyle7\">200 MILES</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Its capital, Maracaibo, was once Venezuela’s oil powerhouse. A <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/americas/venezuela-blackout-maracaibo.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">blackout</a> in March plunged the state into a week of darkness and chaos that left about 500 businesses ransacked.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Power has been sporadic ever since, exacerbating longstanding water and gasoline shortages and leaving towns without functional banking systems and cellphone coverage for days on end.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The flea market, a once-bustling maze of stalls from which vendors hawked food and household goods, has become the face of this crisis.<br/></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Juan Carlos Valles arrives at his tiny canteen in a corner of the market by 5 a.m. and begins making a broth out of beef bones and frying corn pastries in the darkness. He says his stall has been without power since March, his sales are down 80 percent since last year and each day is a struggle against soldiers who force him to accept nearly worthless low-denomination bills.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whatever money he makes he immediately invests in more bones and corn flour, because prices go up daily.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“If you take a rest, you lose,” said Mr. Valles, who has run his canteen since 1998. “The money has become worthless. By the time you take it to the bank, you have already lost some of it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Real incomes in Venezuela have fallen to levels last seen in the country in 1979, according to the international finance institute, leaving many to survive by collecting firewood, gathering fruit and fetching water in streams.<br/></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“The government is talking about solutions in the long and medium term, but the hunger is now,” said Miguel González, the head of the community council at Maracaibo’s Arco Iris shantytown.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He said he lost his job at a hotel when looters ransacked it in March, ripping out even window frames and cable wiring. He now collects wild plums to sell for a few cents in the city’s parks. Most of his community’s diet now consists of wild fruits, fried corn pastries and bone broth, residents said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Farther from the state capital, conditions are worse.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Toas Island, once a touristic idyll of about 12,000 residents spread over fishing hamlets, has been largely abandoned.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There’s no local, regional or national government here,” said José Espina, a motorbike taxi driver there. “We’re on our own.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Electricity and running water are available for only a few hours a day. The boat that provided regular service to the mainland broke down last month. An oil barge lent by the state oil company occasionally tugs a rusty ferry carrying meager supplies of subsidized food — a precarious lifeline for the island’s poorer residents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hyperinflation has reduced the island’s entire budget to the equivalent of $400 a month, or just 3 cents per estimated resident, according to the mayor, Hector Nava.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The hospital has no medication and no patients. The last person to be hospitalized died in agony a day later without treatment for her kidney disease, doctors at the hospital said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As Toas hospital’s beds stand empty, 2-year-old Anailin Nava is wasting away in a nearby hut from malnutrition and treatable muscular paralysis. Her mother, Maibeli Nava, does not have money to take her to Colombia for treatment, she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The four stone quarries that are the island’s only industry have been idle since robbers stole all power cables connecting them to the grid last year. Local opposition activists estimate up to a third of the residents have emigrated from the island in the past two years.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It used to be a paradise,” said Arturo Flores, the local municipality’s security coordinator, who sells a fermented corn drink from a bucket to local fishermen to round up his salary, which is equivalent to $4 a month. “Now, everyone is fleeing.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On the other side of Zulia state, in the ranching town of Machiques, the economic collapse has decimated the meat and dairy industries that had supplied the country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Power cuts have idled the local slaughterhouse, once one of the largest in Latin America. Armed gangs extort and rustle cattle from the surviving ranchers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You can’t produce if there’s no law,” said Rómulo Romero, a local rancher.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Local shopkeepers have pulled together to repair power lines and keep telecom towers running, to feed public workers, and to procure diesel for backup generators.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We have practically taken on the functions of the state,” said Juan Carlos Perrota, a butcher who runs Machiques’ chamber of commerce. “We can’t just put a lock on the door and call it quits. We have hope that this will improve.”</p>',\n",

       " 'venezuela-maduro-hezbollah-drugs': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He is one of the most powerful leaders of the Venezuelan government, a hard-liner who has put down protests, confronted rebels and been a constant presence at the side of Nicolás Maduro, the country’s authoritarian president.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But for years, Tareck El Aissami, one of Mr. Maduro’s closest confidants, has also been the target of wide-ranging investigations by his own country’s intelligence agency into his ties to the criminal underworld.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">According to a secret dossier compiled by Venezuelan agents, Mr. El Aissami and his family have helped sneak Hezbollah militants into the country, gone into business with a drug lord and shielded 140 tons of chemicals believed to be used for cocaine production — helping make him a rich man as his <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/27/world/americas/venezuela-money-how-to-survive.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"> country has spiraled into disarray</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">With its economy in tatters and its people hungry, Venezuela is in the throes of a desperate fight for control of the country. Opposition leaders <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/world/americas/venezuela-guaido-maduro.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fnicholas-casey&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection\" title=\"\">are calling for an uprising</a>, while the country’s military and civilian authorities are refusing to surrender power, presenting a largely united show of force against the protests in the streets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the intelligence documents offer an unusual window into how fractured and nervous the nation’s security services have become, particularly over corruption at the highest levels of government.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. El Aissami, a former vice president who is now Mr. Maduro’s industry minister, has long been in the cross hairs of American investigators. He was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/venezuelan-minister-and-former-vice-president-tareck-zaidan-el-aissami-maddah-charged\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">indicted in March</a> in a Manhattan federal court and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/as0005.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">sanctioned two years ago</a> by the Treasury Department, accused of working with drug lords.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He and Mr. Maduro have <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/world/americas/maduro-tareck-el-aissami-venezuela-drug-trafficking.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">brushed away</a> the charges as part of a propaganda war engineered by the Trump administration to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/world/americas/venezuela-guaido-maduro-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">topple</a> Venezuela’s leftist government.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Venezuela’s own intelligence agency — which Mr. El Aissami once controlled — raised even more alarms about him and his family for more than a decade, putting its concerns in a dossier of documents, investigative findings and transcripts of interviews with drug traffickers.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The dossier, provided to The New York Times by a former top Venezuelan intelligence official and confirmed independently by a second one, recounts testimony from informants accusing Mr. El Aissami and his father of recruiting Hezbollah members to help expand spying and drug trafficking networks in the region.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hezbollah is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, and American officials say the group has long had a presence in South America, where it has helped launder drug money. In 2008, the Treasury Department <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/pages/hp1036.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">sanctioned</a> a different Venezuelan diplomat, accusing him of raising money for Hezbollah and helping its members travel to the country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Mr. El Aissami and his father, Carlos Zaidan El Aissami, a Syrian immigrant who had worked with Hezbollah on return visits to his country, also pushed to bring Hezbollah into Venezuela, according to the dossier.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Informants told intelligence agents that Mr. El Aissami’s father was involved in a plan to train Hezbollah members in Venezuela, “with the aim of expanding intelligence networks throughout Latin America and at the same time working in drug trafficking,” the documents say.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. El Aissami helped the plan along, the dossier adds, by using his authority over residency permits to issue official documents to Hezbollah militants, enabling them to stay in the country.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Whether Hezbollah ever set up its intelligence network or drug routes in Venezuela is not addressed in the dossier. But it does assert that Hezbollah militants established themselves in the country with Mr. El Aissami’s help.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. El Aissami acted as a facilitator to the underworld in other ways as well. The documents say that his brother, Feraz, went into business with Venezuela’s most notorious drug lord, Walid Makled, and held nearly $45 million in Swiss bank accounts.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. El Aissami had links to the drug lord, too, the documents say, noting that he issued large government contracts to a company tied to Mr. Makled.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And as the country headed toward economic collapse, forcing millions to flee Venezuela and its dangerous shortages of food and medicine, Mr. El Aissami became a wealthy man, the dossier says.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Using a frontman currently under sanctions by the United States, Mr. El Aissami bought an American bank, parts of a construction company, a stake in a Panamanian mall, land for a high-end resort and numerous Venezuelan real estate projects, including a “millionaire’s mansion” for his parents, according to the documents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. El Aissami did not respond to a written request for an interview, and no charges have been filed in Venezuela against him for drug trafficking or corruption.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But on March 8, the United States unsealed its indictment against Mr. El Aissami, making him the second member of Mr. Maduro’s cabinet known to be indicted on drug trafficking charges.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Néstor Reverol, the nation’s current interior minister, has also been indicted. And in 2017, two nephews of Mr. Maduro’s wife, Cilia Flores, were sentenced to 18 years in an American prison after trying to traffic 800 kilograms of cocaine.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The American government said Mr. El Aissami was deeply involved in the narcotics trade when it sanctioned him in 2017, freezing his assets along with those of Samark López, who was accused of being his frontman. It said Mr. El Aissami oversaw or partly owned narcotics shipments weighing more than a ton, managed an international network of businesses to help launder profits and forged an alliance with Mr. Makled, the drug trafficker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But American prosecutors never revealed the evidence in their case.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Venezuelan intelligence memos examined by The Times offer some of the most concrete details yet on how one of the country’s most powerful families built its empire, sketching out a family saga that stretched from Syria to Venezuela, from the narcotics trade to the president’s inner circle.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the trails led to a lonely road near Venezuela’s border with Brazil.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A national guard officer interviewed about a 2004 raid told prosecutors about a set of “warehouses that were in a state of decay, looking abandoned.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the site wasn’t empty. It was being used to store chemicals, including 140 metric tons of urea, a precursor substance used to make cocaine, according to the Venezuelan intelligence documents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Urea was a controlled substance in Venezuela, and the owners couldn’t initially provide licenses for the suspicious chemicals, the documents said. A police investigator told prosecutors that while the urea supposedly was meant to be sold as fertilizer, the explanation was suspicious because there was no agriculture in the region.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And then there was the owner of the chemicals: Mr. Makled, the drug trafficker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The bust was the beginning of the end for the Venezuelan drug lord, who is wanted for extradition by the United States. The Drug Enforcement Administration began building cases against him for running drugs with the aid of top officials. Mr. Makled was captured six years later and sentenced in 2015 to a 14-year sentence in Venezuela for drug trafficking and money laundering.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But seemingly overlooked was the other man at the center of the case: Haisam Alaisami, another relative of Mr. El Aissami, who told prosecutors he was the legal representative for Makled Investments, Mr. Makled’s company. Two people familiar with the family identified him as Mr. El Aissami’s first cousin.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He could offer no information on who the potential buyers of the urea were, and investigators eventually referred the case to the narcotics division of Venezuela’s criminal and forensics agency on “suspicion of contraband,” according to police documents included in the intelligence dossier.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Neither Mr. Makled nor Mr. Alaisami responded to written requests for comment.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Alaisami had a powerful family member in Mr. El Aissami, who was raised with him in Venezuela with other members of the clan who had arrived from Syria.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the investigation worked its way through state agencies, Mr. El Aissami’s star rose in leftist political circles. He went from being a confidant of President Hugo Chavez’s brother, to a legislator for the governing Socialist Party, to interior minister in 2008.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was that year that a company owned by the state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, intervened: It wrote a letter saying it could account for the chemicals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">No charges were filed against Mr. Makled or Mr. Alaisami in the case. Prosecutors’ documents appear to show the shipment of urea was even returned to Mr. Makled, who ramped up his drug trafficking business in Venezuela and Colombia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Other branches of the El Aissami family were also looking to do business with Mr. Makled.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Sometime before 2010, Mr. Makled was approached by Mr. El Aissami’s brother, Feraz, to provide a large sum of money to a Panama-based import company, according to an intelligence briefing in the dossier. The drug lord’s money was intended for the purchase of an oil tanker to be used in a contract with the state oil company.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Both El Aissami brothers seem to have been deeply involved in the business, according to the document. Feraz and a business partner were the public faces of the company, while Tareck, from his post as the nation’s interior minister, signed lucrative government deals with them, including a no-bid contract to provide supplies to Venezuela’s prison system, according to the intelligence report.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A third figure tied to the business cast additional suspicion on the import company: Mr. López, the man American officials said aided Mr. El Aissami’s drug trafficking network and served as his frontman.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The intelligence report also includes HSBC bank statements of accounts tied to Mr. El Aissami’s brother, Feraz, that totaled nearly $45 million — money it says was linked to Mr. Makled, the drug trafficker.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">HSBC closed the Feraz accounts after Mr. Makled was arrested on drug trafficking charges, according to the intelligence documents.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The dossier concludes with informant testimony on the family’s ties to Hezbollah, outlining the effort to recruit militants who could establish a drug and information network across Latin America.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of the sources of the information was the drug lord, Mr. Makled, who described Mr. El Aissami’s involvement in the scheme, according to the intelligence memo.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was not the only time Mr. El Aissami had been accused of aiding Hezbollah and Mr. Makled. American — and some Venezuelan — officials have made similar allegations, though Mr. El Aissami has denied involvement with militant groups in the past, even after news <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2017/02/10/investigacion-pasaportes-en-la-sombra-llega-al-senado-de-estados-unidos/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">media reports</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Venezuelan intelligence officials believed they had evidence to the contrary. The dossier ends with references to photographs of people who “belong with the aforementioned terrorist group.”</p>',\n",

       " 'venezuela-shipwreck': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">CHAGUARAMAS, Trinidad and Tobago — She slipped out of the house around dusk, without telling her mother. Sixteen and hungry, she followed the men who had promised her work and food.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Instead, they smuggled her out of Venezuela by sea, secretly planning to force her into a brothel in Trinidad.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Put in a fishing boat, the girl, Yoskeili Zurita, said she sped away with dozens of other women, including her cousin. But the overloaded skiff took on water fast — and capsized with the roll of a sudden swell.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Screams pealed across the water. Women cried out the names of children they had left behind. In the darkness, someone prayed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My cousin didn’t know how to swim. She looked at me and said, ‘I can’t do this,’” recalled Yoskeili, who spent two days clinging to the overturned hull in the strait between Trinidad and Venezuela before fishermen found her. She never saw her cousin again.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The boat sank with 38 passengers in late April, most of them women. Only nine people survived, among them Yoskeili and other women who the authorities now say were victims of a human smuggling ring.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The tragedy was shocking even in Venezuela, a nation accustomed to the ravages of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/world/americas/venezuela-economy.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a collapsing state</a>, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/17/world/americas/venezuela-children-starving.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">hunger</a>, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/27/world/americas/venezuela-money-how-to-survive.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">hyperinflation</a> and rampant crime. For millions, survival means leaving, whatever the risk may be.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the last four years alone, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/06/1040001\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">about</a> <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/06/1040001\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">four million people</a> have abandoned the country, the United Nations estimates. They leave on foot, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/world/americas/venezuela-refugees-colombia.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">crossing a treacherous pass</a> in the Andes Mountains. They sell their hair in plazas in border towns, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/world/americas/venezuela-brazil-migrants.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">huddle in refugee tents in Brazil</a> and Colombia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And they <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/world/americas/hungry-venezuelans-flee-in-boats-to-escape-economic-collapse.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">head off in leaky boats</a> short on gas or spare parts — and sometimes get lost at sea.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">As the women in Yoskeili’s boat fought to survive, their state was nowhere to be found. The government, crippled by <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-hezbollah-drugs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">corruption</a>, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/world/americas/venezuela-oil-economy.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">mismanagement</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/politics/venezuela-sanctions-trump-oil.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">American sanctions</a> on its oil industry, told relatives the day after the wreck that it lacked even the fuel to mount a rescue. A state helicopter arrived four days late to join a search that had been left mainly to local fishermen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And Venezuela’s National Guard likely played a hand in the deaths: Venezuelan prosecutors have charged two soldiers for being part of a criminal group that tried to smuggle the women to Trinidad.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then in May, while the country was still coming to terms with the disaster, the tragedy repeated itself: Another smuggling boat sank into the waves with 33 passengers aboard, including at least three minors. Only the captain survived, disappearing before the police could question him.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“How can this be allowed to happen again?” said Salvador Díaz, whose daughter had been on the boat with Yoskeili, hoping to reach Trinidad, when it sank.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yoskeili now passes days alone in her room, at times wondering why she survived when so many other women drowned at sea.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One of them, Carmen Lares, a single mother, first lost her job this year, then lost her 3-month-old baby to malnutrition at the start of April as food ran short. Now she is gone as well.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yoskeili replays the night over and over in her mind, remembering the crash of the waves against the hull, the women who couldn’t swim and took off their clothes in the frantic hope that it would help them stay afloat, and the promises of the men taking her to Trinidad.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They said when we got there, there would be plenty to eat,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Díaz was slowly watching his family disappear.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">First his younger son, a petroleum engineer, left to Brazil, crossing treacherous borderlands controlled by criminal groups. Suddenly his 22-year-old daughter, Oriana Díaz, was talking about smuggling herself into Trinidad.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He never imagined anything like this. Until recently, he had enjoyed a middle-class life as a public high school teacher. His other son was an accountant. The family used to vacation around the Caribbean, not flee there.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But food was in short supply. Domestic production had collapsed and the few imported foods on the shelves had become unobtainable ever since hyperinflation had destroyed his salary. His daughter was a single mother with two children to feed, ages 5 months and 2.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I would leave the food for my wife and daughter, and I would go to sleep with none,” said Mr. Díaz. “This is what is happening in Venezuela, the parents stop eating to give food to our children, our grandchildren.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">So when Oriana said she would head to Trinidad to send money back to the family, her father felt he couldn’t object.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I took her 2-year-old to the football field that was beside our house so he wouldn’t see his mother leave the house,” said Mr. Díaz.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In another part of town, Héctor Torres, recently penniless after he lost his job at a soda factory, was busy recruiting teenage girls for his first attempt at smuggling women to the island.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Torres tried to hide the true purpose of the journey, asking his sister, Eloaiza Torres, to take the women and girls into her house until the boat left.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These are some female friends who are coming to Trinidad,” Ms. Torres recalled being told. She said the group included two minors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yoskeili said she was approached by a smuggler named Nano while she sat on her porch with two of her cousins. He gave her very little time to decide; the boat was leaving the next night and Nano — later identified by Venezuelan prosecutors as Dayson Alexander Alleyne, a 28-year-old now under arrest for human trafficking — promised plenty of food at the end of the journey.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Yoskeili didn’t tell her mother, fearing she might stop her, and confided only in her aging grandmother that she planned to go.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At 7 p.m., Nano arrived in a car, shoving Yoskeili inside and speeding off to a hotel where she was put into a room with other girls, she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We’d been kidnapped,” she said. “They didn’t want anyone to see us.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Evening fell on the Venezuelan fishing town of Güiria, where at the end of a pier a boatman prepared the skiff for the trip. Yoskeili’s fear became much more intense when she asked the other women what kind of work they would do on the island.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“All the girls on the boat said we were going to be prostitutes,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Others were just as surprised. Yubreilis Merchán, a hair stylist, believed she was being taken to see her mother in Trinidad. But women and girls kept being loaded aboard.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We were so many. We were saying, ‘There’s water coming in the boat,’ and the boatman just said this was normal,” she recalled, adding that the women at first tried to bail out the boat as they were crowded on.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Packed with 38 people, heavy motors, suitcases and contraband merchandise, the boat — named the Jhonnailys José — finally took off around sunset, April 23. The night was clear in Venezuela. A quarter moon was set to rise after 10:30 p.m., which would help the boatman see along the roughly 45-mile route.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the waves were getting rough. Some smashed into the hull, and the boat came down with a thud over large swells.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Then the motor went dead.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Without power, the Jhonnailys José was tossed, turning perpendicular against the waves. One overtook the boat, crashing inside. The boatman fumbled with a backup motor and the boat lurched.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We started to scream, ‘We are going to sink!’” recalled Ms. Merchán.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Terrified, the passengers forced him to turn back for Venezuela with the backup motor as the boat continued to take on water. The women threw suitcases into the sea and bailed out water with their shoes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was too late. The water had engulfed the boat. It sank into the waves before flipping over.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I thought of my daughters: I have three girls, one that’s 5, another 3, another who turned 7 months old the day that I left,” Ms. Merchán said. “We were in a state of total desperation.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She tried to hold on to a gas canister, but it leaked fuel that burned her face. A smuggler barked orders while some of the women who couldn’t swim crawled on top of the ones who could, in a frenzied attempt to breathe, Ms. Merchán said.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle0\">Venezuela</p><p class=\"g-pstyle1\">20 miles</p><p class=\"g-pstyle2\">Chaguaramas</p><p class=\"g-pstyle3\">Port of Spain</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">Pato I.</p><p class=\"g-pstyle5\">Güiria</p><p class=\"g-pstyle4\">Trinidad</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">Trinidad</p><p class=\"g-pstyle6\">and Tobago</p><p class=\"g-pstyle7\">Detail area</p><p class=\"g-pstyle8\">Venezuela</p><p class=\"g-pstyle8\">Colombia</p><p class=\"g-pstyle8\">Brazil</p><p class=\"g-pstyle9\">200 miles</p><p class=\"css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit\" data-testid=\"credit\" id=\"interactive-credit\">By The New York Times</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In the pandemonium, she saw one woman trying to escape the rest.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I said, ‘Where are you headed?’” she asked. The woman signaled toward a rocky outcrop in the straits.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lifted by a current, the two women pushed away from the capsized boat, holding hands under the water so as not to lose one another as the voices of their fellow passengers grew distant. After a long time, they heard the sound of surf beating against the rocks of Patos Island.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Merchán waded ashore, exhausted. Her mind suddenly flashed to her friend Yocelys Rojas, whom she had left behind at the boat.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Before they had set off that night, her friend was itching to share some news about her family back in Venezuela. But the loud motor had drowned out her voice, and Ms. Rojas was saving the story for the other side.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“She disappeared and I will never know what she was going to tell me,” said Ms. Merchán.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Trinidad, a bar owner in the capital, Port of Spain, got word that the women never made it to shore.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He had paid $300 to the smugglers to take one of the women to his bar, where she would work as a prostitute, he said. He had also paid a bribe to members of the Trinidadian Coast Guard so that they would not stop the boat, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But no one showed up that night, said the bar owner, who asked that his name be withheld to discuss details of the crime.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Venezuelan radio had begun reporting the shipwreck. But as is often the case in Venezuela, where <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/americas/venezuela-blackout-maracaibo.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">blackouts are rampant</a>, there was no electricity in much of Güiria that day.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Díaz, the teacher whose children were steadily leaving for uncertain futures abroad, was sitting with his grandchildren outside to escape the heat when his phone rang.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They said that the boat my daughter was on had flipped,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Díaz went to the harbormaster’s office. Dozens of other relatives of the missing had gathered to check on the search for survivors.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But nothing had begun.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They said there was no gasoline,” Mr. Díaz said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His anger rising, Mr. Díaz went to the Coast Guard office, which told him it hadn’t been authorized to perform a search, he said. Relatives of other victims say they had also been dismissed, encouraged to find fuel to mount their own improvised rescues with local fishermen.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The town mayor arrived, saying a helicopter would arrive, residents said. It didn’t come until four days later, they said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Díaz stayed up all night, working his phone to see if any fishing boat could search for his daughter, Oriana. Sometime after midnight, he got word from his son-in-law that a boat was available.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But when he arrived at the pier at 3 a.m., he discovered the boat had neither fuel nor motor oil. Frantically, Mr. Díaz searched the town but could find only oil. Eventually, someone found gasoline, but just five gallons, not enough to get them back to land.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was sunrise on April 25, two days after the boat capsized. Even though Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world, the government vessels were still short on gasoline. Fishermen used their own money to mount the search.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">One man returning from a rescue attempt told Mr. Díaz that they had found only bodies in the water, which they had loaded onto a boat headed back to Venezuela.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“My heart crumpled,” Mr. Díaz said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Out on Patos Island, Ms. Merchán was desperately seeking help.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">After wading ashore, she had seen fishing vessels passing, but none had stopped. She was exhausted and could barely scream. At night she could see lights she believed were those of search vessels.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We went on our knees, we prayed to God, screaming,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Ms. Merchán and the others took a risk, entering the water again to navigate the surf until they found a rocky outcrop that was more visible.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It was the right decision. Shortly after, a fishing boat pulled up with her husband and several other relatives looking for the victims.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I just cried and cried,” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In another part of the straits, Yoskeili said she had begun to hallucinate as she floated in the water, at one point thinking she had reached land.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She eventually fell unconscious floating near other passengers, as some were swept farther out to sea by currents. Two days later, she said she could feel the thudding of an engine in the water. A rescue boat arrived and dragged her aboard.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Back on shore, Mr. Díaz was convinced that his daughter had died.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But the same day the women were found alive on Patos Island, an ambulance with more survivors whooshed by. A fishing boat had found his daughter, Oriana, in the water, still breathing, near the wreckage.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“A boy said, ‘Professor, your daughter is here,’” Mr. Díaz said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Oriana sat in the hospital bed, with gashes in her arms, her face and lips so burned from her days in the sun that she could hardly speak. She had no pants, having lost them at sea.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“She could have been missing an arm or a leg, but my daughter was alive,” said Mr. Díaz. He put a blanket around her as she asked for water.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Just to think of this once more is to feel this agony and to know how one will never forget these times,” he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For Omar Velásquez, whose 15-year-old daughter, Omarlys, was aboard the boat that night, there was no reunion in the hospital, only the hurt that she hadn’t told him why she left — and the grief that she never appeared again.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On a recent day, he mulled over the many unanswered questions. How did an overloaded boat smuggling dozens of women manage to leave the port undetected by Venezuela’s Coast Guard? Why was there no fuel for the government rescue boats, and why was no aerial search mounted for days?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And above all, he asked: Would there ever be justice for what happened?</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“There was a deep complicity of the government that was behind this,” said Mr. Velásquez.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Carlos Valero, a lawmaker in Venezuela’s opposition-controlled National Assembly, points to the arrests of the two national guardsmen as evidence that government employees played a hand in the smuggling ring. But an investigation he opened last month has gone nowhere, he said, blocked by the country’s ruling party.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Valero has focused his attention on Trinidad, where he says he has gathered evidence that Coast Guard and immigration officials were paid about $100 for each woman aboard the boat — payments to allow them to enter. Answers from the authorities in Trinidad have also been hard to come by, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s like these people don’t exist,” he said of the victims.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In Port of Spain, the bar owner who said he was bringing one of the women aboard the boat continues his business unperturbed. One night in May, at the bar he runs in the capital, he flipped through pictures of underage Venezuelan girls on a cellphone, sent to him over the messaging service WhatsApp.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He explained the arrangement he had with the Venezuelan women conscripted to work under him: He pays a fee to the boatman for their passage, confiscates their passports and returns them only after the women paid several times what he spent to have them smuggled, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The arrangement worked with the help of the Port of Spain police and the Trinidadian Coast Guard, both of which received payments, he said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Trinidad government did not respond to written questions or requests for comment. Three commercial boat owners in Trinidad and a fourth in Venezuela confirmed that they had either made payments to smuggle prostitutes from Venezuela, or had witnessed such payments by other boatmen bringing women to Trinidad.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At the Port of Spain bar, police officers approached the owner, in plain view of several Venezuelan women who worked under him, and greeted him in front of a reporter.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“These are my friends, I know them well,” the owner said of the officers, smiling.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Relatives of the suspects in the human trafficking ring said their family members had been falsely accused by the surviving women; none of those jailed could be reached through the Venezuelan prison system.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For all his anger, Mr. Díaz now seemed most consumed by the question that had led his daughter to leave: how to get food. Hyperinflation has continued. The food shortages remain. And no one in the family has dared to cross the waters again.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We had big hopes for her,” he said of his daughter, Oriana. “She would be able to support all of us in Trinidad.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He took a deep breath and added: “But the cure was worse than the sickness.”</p>',\n",

       " 'vincent-lambert-dead': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">PARIS — Vincent Lambert, a former nurse who had been in a vegetative state for over a decade, died on Thursday in Reims, France, after an intense family dispute over his fate that led to years of legal battles and put him at the center of right-to-die debates. He was 42.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His death was confirmed by Jean Paillot, a lawyer for his parents. Doctors had stopped artificially feeding and hydrating Mr. Lambert this month after <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/world/europe/france-vincent-lambert-life-support.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a final court ruling in his case</a>, and placed him under heavy sedation.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Lambert had been kept alive since suffering severe brain damage in a road accident in 2008. He had not left written instructions on his end-of-life wishes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His wife, Rachel Lambert, said that he had clearly stated that he would not wish to live in a vegetative state. His parents argued that ending his life support amounted to the murder of a disabled person. Siblings and other family members took different sides in the dispute.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It is a real relief for us,” said François Lambert, Vincent Lambert’s nephew, who for years advocated switching off his uncle’s life support. “Vincent had been the victim of irrational medicine for years. It had to stop.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Lambert’s parents have not commented on their son’s death, but their lawyer, Mr. Paillot, said it was “a deadly day for our country.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Vincent Lambert was killed by his own doctor because he was disabled,” Mr. Paillot said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in France. But the law allows patients who are terminally ill or injured with no chances of recovery to decide to stop treatments if the measures “appear useless, disproportionate” or if they seem to have no other effect than “artificially maintaining life.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">If a patient is no longer able to express a decision, as was Mr. Lambert’s case, doctors may stop treatment in consultation with family members.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Lambert’s parents, observant Roman Catholics who gained the support of anti-euthanasia activists, argued that the law should not apply in this case because their son was not terminally ill and was a disabled person in need of protection. Catholic doctrine forbids euthanasia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Rachel Lambert, who was made Mr. Lambert’s legal guardian in 2016, pointed to multiple medical assessments that found her husband to be in an irreversible vegetative state, and to court rulings that said artificially feeding and hydrating him to keep him alive constituted “unreasonable obstinacy” as defined by French law.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">A vegetative state can be defined as a condition that occurs when the part of the brain that controls thought and behavior no longer works, but vital functions like the sleep cycle, body temperature control and breathing persist.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">People in a vegetative state can sometimes open their eyes and have basic reflexes, but they do not have a meaningful response to stimulation or display signs of experiencing emotions.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In an interview <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.bfmtv.com/mediaplayer/video/sur-bfmtv-rachel-lambert-la-femme-de-vincent-veut-que-son-mari-soit-respecte-dans-ses-convictions-1172308.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">with the BFM TV news channel</a> this month about her husband’s case, Ms. Lambert said that she wanted to “finally see him a free man,” and expressed discomfort with the attention his case had drawn.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s a medical decision, which should stay within the private life of our family,” Ms. Lambert said. “Vincent should not be a standard-bearer, in one way or another. He should just be seen as a unique person.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Viviane Lambert, Mr. Lambert’s mother, had taken his case to the United Nations in hopes of putting diplomatic pressure on France to keep his life support on. Mr. Lambert’s parents had referred his case to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/crpd/pages/crpdindex.aspx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities</a>, a United Nations-affiliated body.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Without your intercession, my son, Vincent Lambert, will be euthanized by a doctor because of his cerebral disability,” she said this month in Geneva before the United Nations Human Rights Council. “He is in a state of minimal consciousness, but he is not a vegetable.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The Roman Catholic Church had made several appeals for Mr. Lambert to be kept on life support. The Vatican’s Pontifical Academy for Life <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/PontAcadLife/status/1149235283990327298\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">tweeted Thursday morning</a>: “The death of #VincentLambert and his story are a defeat for our humanity.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Lambert’s life support was initially withdrawn in May, but the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities had asked the French authorities to stay any decision, and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/world/europe/france-vincent-lambert-life-support.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">a surprise court ruling</a> in favor of Mr. Lambert’s parents had bolstered that request. A higher court later <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/world/europe/france-vincent-lambert-life-support.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">struck that ruling down</a>, agreeing with the French state that the committee’s request was not legally binding.</p>',\n",

       " 'when-patients-need-opioids-to-ease-the-pain': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">My patient, a yoga instructor, had already received a week of chemotherapy, so he couldn’t be called a complete newcomer to the side effects of his treatment. But he was still bracing himself for what was yet to come.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He was in his 70s and had a rare variety of a rare cancer: acute lymphocytic leukemia, which affects <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/alyl.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">fewer than 3,000 adults yearly</a> in the United States, along with the more common acute myeloid leukemia. Usually, leukemia chooses to corrupt only one tribe of our white blood cells: myeloid or lymphoid, the soldiers of the immune system; his had chosen both.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In response, we decided on therapy that would try to clobber both leukemias at the same time.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The drugs had hit the mark, as the leukemia had disappeared entirely from his blood stream. But they had also missed, taking a whack at his liver and disrupting how his body processed the bile the liver usually makes to help digest food. This misfire had transformed his skin and the whites of his eyes to a painful-to-view fluorescent yellow.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The drugs had also inflamed and eroded the tissue lining the inside of his mouth and esophagus. The pain that resulted made it nearly impossible for him to consume even the thinnest of liquids. One patient told me that with this condition, called mucositis, drinking water was like trying to swallow glass.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">On morning rounds, I asked the nurse practitioner caring for him what medicines he was taking to relieve his distress.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She grimaced. “Not much. He can’t take pills anymore,” she said. “We gave him a mouthwash to help with the pain.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“What about a P.C.A. pump?” I asked. Patient-controlled analgesia pumps allow a background rate of narcotics, often morphine or fentanyl; the patient can then administer extra doses, or boluses, as needed by pushing a button on the IV pump. It was our usual treatment for the unrelenting agony of mucositis, which wouldn’t get better until his immune system recovered from the chemotherapy, weeks from then.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“He’s refused it,” she said, simply. “He doesn’t want to get addicted to the drugs.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When we entered his room, my patient gave us a brave smile behind his bedside table. It held cups of water, ice, liquid medicines to numb his anguish, and sponge applicators he could use to gently apply the medicine to the fire that raged in his mouth. His lips were red and swollen, the inflammation made even more stark in contrast to the iridescence of his yellow skin. I sat at the edge of his bed.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“That looks like it really, really hurts,” I said softly.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">His eyes met mine briefly, then looked away. “It’s not fun,” he answered, his voice barely above a whisper.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Will you let us help with the pain? The only way people get through this is with narcotics we can give you through your IV. The P.C.A. pump.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He shook his head. “I’m managing O.K.” He held up one of the green sponges he used for his mouth to show me how he was managing, wearily. It was an effort for him to say even those few words. I wondered if he dipped into some reserves of meditation he had learned through yoga to be so calm in the face of such misery.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Are you worried you’ll get hooked on the pain medications?” I asked. He glanced down at the sponge, his only temporary salvation from the mucositis, and nodded a bit.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I felt so bad for him. It wasn’t the first time I had heard this from one of my patients. The scourge of the opiate crisis is appalling in the scope of human life it has affected and in the nefarious actions of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/us/doctor-arrested-prescription-drugs.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">some doctors</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/health/sacklers-oxycontin-lawsuits.html?login=email&amp;auth=login-email&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">pharmaceutical manufacturers</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/nyregion/opioid-crisis-drug-trafficking-rochester.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">distributors</a> who have helped fuel it. It is rightly labeled an epidemic.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But there are people with diagnoses like cancer who wouldn’t be able to withstand their conditions — or the aggressive therapies we administer to try to rid them of these diagnoses — without supportive medications like opiates. What has gotten lost in a lot of reporting about the crisis, and the regulatory guardrails that have been put in place to limit opioid prescribing, are the patients who genuinely need the drugs to make their excruciating existence at least somewhat tolerable.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">I told my patient that, when used appropriately for limited periods of time and with a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/physical-side-effects/pain/opioid-pain-medicines-for-cancer-pain.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">proper tapering schedule</a>, it was unlikely he would get hooked on painkillers. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/166352/abstract\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">One study</a> even showed that death from opioids was 10 times less likely to occur in cancer patients versus the general population.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“You know, we don’t award a crown of thorns at the end of this for suffering,” I gently teased him.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He gave me a half smile, as if more than that would bring on another wave of suffering, and nodded.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“O.K. I’ll try it.” He closed his eyes and let his head drop back in his pillow, as if even the thought of a drug that would finally ameliorate his pain gave him relief.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">We started the P.C.A. within the hour, and that night he slept soundly, his pain eased, for the first time in days.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Dr. Mikkael Sekeres (</em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MikkaelSekeres?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">@MikkaelSekeres</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">) is director of the leukemia program at the </em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://my.clevelandclinic.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">Cleveland Clinic</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">.</em></p>',\n",

       " 'white-house-social-media-summit': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">WASHINGTON — The day of a planned White House social media summit was off to an energetic start on Thursday, when President Trump blasted out a round of Twitter insults against his enemies, defended the Pledge of Allegiance, called himself “great looking and smart” and announced an afternoon Rose Garden news conference on his administration’s battle to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census — all before 8 o’clock in the morning.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“A big subject today at the White House Social Media Summit will be the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies,” Mr. Trump said, referring to platforms like Google, Facebook and Twitter. “The Fake News is not as important, or as powerful, as Social Media.”</p><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">A big subject today at the White House Social Media Summit will be the tremendous dishonesty, bias, discrimination and suppression practiced by certain companies. We will not let them get away with it much longer. The Fake News Media will also be there, but for a limited period..</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The morning Twitter messages allowed Mr. Trump to kick off an event that will gather a group of supporters who have grown from fringe lurkers in the internet’s backwaters to significant disrupters — largely thanks to Mr. Trump’s attentions — and who think they are being discriminated against for their conservative views. The guest list has alarmed critics who fear it is bringing together people who disseminate threats, hate speech and actual fake news, and who sometimes have their messages elevated with the velocity of a presidential tweet.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">At first glance, the guest list sounds like a 4Chan message board come to life.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">[</em><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/business/trump-social-media-summit.html?module=inline\" title=\"\"><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">The event illuminates the influence of pro-Trump trolls in the political establishment, our technology columnist writes.</em></a><em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">]</em></p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">James O’Keefe, who <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/us/politics/james-okeefe-project-veritas-trump.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">captures secret recordings to embarrass liberals and journalists</a> and who has received donations from the Trump Foundation, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.projectveritas.com/2019/07/08/white-house-invites-james-okeefe-to-social-media-summit-on-heels-of-veritas-google-expose/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">will attend</a>. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ali/status/1148303802749149184\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">So will Ali Alexander</a>, whose tweet questioning Senator Kamala Harris’s racial background was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-kamala-harris.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">shared by the president’s eldest son</a> after Ms. Harris, Democrat of California, spoke about race during the first 2020 presidential debate.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">And so will a supporter <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/CarpeDonktum/status/1145909172015439874\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">who goes by the moniker “Carpe Donktum.”</a> His credentials include creating a doctored video that appeared to show former Vice President Joseph R.

That video <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/us/politics/trump-biden-tweet-meme.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">was shared by the president</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">(Some semblance of crowd control belatedly kicked in: Ben Garrison, a pro-Trump cartoonist, was initially invited but will not be attending after critics accused him of drawing an anti-Semitic cartoon.)</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Other guests, like Charlie Kirk, the 25-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, a group that reaches out to young conservatives, said he represented a “center right” view, wants the president to explore helping supporters who say their content has been blocked — and stripped of potential advertising revenue — by social media platforms. Mr. Kirk and members of his organization have been <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/06/15/turning-point-usa-accused-%E2%80%98boosting-their-numbers-racists%E2%80%99-long-established-conservative\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">criticized</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center for tweets that contained anti-immigrant or racist views.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think it’s a win for this country that the forum is happening,” Mr. Kirk said in an interview. “It definitely is a listening session for the administration to be able to gather facts and data.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Trump is seeking proof that he and his supporters have been marginalized on social media. The president has crusaded for months against what he and his closest advisers believe is a concerted effort to muffle conservative voices. Last August, after the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was largely barred from Facebook, Apple and Google, he ramped up his critiques.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Google search results for ‘Trump News’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media,” <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/28/business/media/google-trump-news-results.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Mr. Trump tweeted</a>. “In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me &amp; others, so that almost all stories &amp; news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“They are controlling what we can &amp; cannot see,” he added. “This is a very serious situation — will be addressed!”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Those claims mirror <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/technology/lawmakers-facebook-twitter-foreign-influence-hearing.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">efforts by conservatives in Congress</a> who have summoned Twitter, Facebook and Google executives to grill them on how their algorithms could be used to hide deliberate efforts to suppress conservative voices.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Indeed, the event is just as notable because of those who will not be there: Representatives from Facebook did not receive an invitation, according to a spokesman, and representatives from Twitter and Google are not expected to appear.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Most of the activists attending represent — and spend their time transmitting — a larger theory of suppression and bias against conservatives. In May, the White House <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/donald-trump-twitter-facebook-youtube.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">unveiled a website</a> that asked users to share evidence of discrimination, along with their citizenship status and contact details. That information was used to organize Thursday’s gathering.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Earlier this year, the White House launched a tool to allow Americans, regardless of their political views, to share how they have been affected by bias online,” Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said in an email. “After receiving thousands of responses, the president wants to engage directly with these digital leaders in a discussion on the power of social media.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Advocacy groups that say their clients have faced discrimination online accused the Trump administration of promoting hate. Madihha Ahussain, a lawyer with Muslim Advocates, a nonprofit legal and advocacy organization, described the summit as a ruse.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Enforcing basic standards of decency on social media isn’t censoring conservative speech,” Ms. Ahussain said in a statement. “Hate speech is hate speech, regardless of whether the person spewing it has met with the president.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She added, “We urge social media platforms to ignore the circus at the White House and instead commit to enforcing their hate-content policies objectively and forcefully.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Mr. Kirk, of Turning Point USA, said the event process reminded him of a listening session Mr. Trump held this year with conservative college students. The result was <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/trump-free-speech-executive-order.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">an executive order meant to protect free speech on college campuses</a>. Mr. Kirk said he did not necessarily expect the same outcome, but believed Mr. Trump might consider his options.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I think that’s a positive thing that the president is hearing new ideas and entertaining difference of opinion” and seeing if he could use his power to tackle conservatives’ complaints, Mr. Kirk said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Also scheduled to attend is Brad Parscale, the president’s 2020 campaign manager. Mr. Parscale oversaw digital strategy for Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/12/03/trump_strategist_brad_parscale_vs_pbs_frontline_on_campaigns_use_of_facebook.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">which relied heavily on buying ads on Facebook</a>. Since then, Mr. Parscale has been vocal in his criticism of Facebook, Google and Twitter, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/09/10/trump-google-youtube-search-results-biased-against-republicans-conservatives-column/1248099002/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">accusing them of blacklisting conservatives</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“At a time when social media platforms are banning conservative voices and supporters of the president,” Mr. Parscale said in a message on Tuesday, “it’s important for President Trump to emphasize that he appreciates their support and wants to protect their First Amendment rights.”</p>',\n",

       " 'wimbledon-halep-serena-williams-strycova': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">WIMBLEDON, England — It will be Serena Williams versus Simona Halep in the Wimbledon final on Saturday.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Halep will be trying to win her first Wimbledon women’s singles title. Williams will be chasing her eighth, which would also tie the record of 24 Grand Slam singles title held by Margaret Court.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Williams, 37, played one of her finest matches of this often-frustrating season, outplaying and overpowering Barbora Strycova, 6-1, 6-2, in 59 minutes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Earlier Thursday on Centre Court, Halep became the first Romanian woman to reach a Wimbledon singles final, defeating Elina Svitolina, 6-1, 6-3.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Williams has yet to win a title since she returned to the tour in March 2018 after giving birth to a daughter, Olympia.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But she is now into her third Grand Slam final since her comeback after losing last year to Angelique Kerber <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/sports/serena-williams-angelique-kerber-wimbledon.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">at Wimbledon</a> and to Naomi Osaka <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/sports/serena-williams-vs-naomi-osaka-us-open.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">at the United States Open</a>.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But she has rarely hit the ball as cleanly and convincingly under pressure since her return to competition as she did against Strycova, a fiery and resourceful Czech who was playing in her first Grand Slam singles semifinal at age 33.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Strycova, once in the top 20 in singles and one of the world’s best doubles players, has a big bag of tennis tricks. She tried many of them against Williams without success on Thursday as Williams chased down drop shots, bent low to hit winners off crisply sliced returns and was generally overwhelming.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In four singles matches against Williams, Strycova has yet to win a set.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Halep’s match with Svitolina was full of extended rallies, but Halep’s consistency, marvelous two-handed backhand and deep focus made the difference.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Svitolina, who was playing in her first Grand Slam singles semifinal, and Halep have similar counterpunching styles. Both are fast with balanced baseline games. Svitolina had won four of their seven previous matches, with Halep winning their most recent duel: a draining three-setter in the semifinals in Doha this year.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Halep fought her way through the tight and tense early games and then consistently found a higher gear.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s one of the best moments of my life,” Halep said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Halep, a former No. 1 and French Open champion, has now reached the finals of three different Grand Slam tournaments: the French Open, the Australian Open and Wimbledon. Svitolina’s most significant victory came last season when she <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/sports/tennis/elina-svitolina-sloane-stephens-wta-finals.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">won the year-end WTA Finals </a>in Singapore.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I was nervous, but I think it was the same as in some other matches, like big matches,” Svitolina said. “I played a few I would say. I didn’t play as many as probably she did because she won a Grand Slam, so she knows how it feels to achieve something major in your career. I don’t know if it’s lack of experience a little bit today, but I think she played unbelievable today. She was moving really good and striking the ball perfectly.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Halep, seeded seventh, does look fresh in the legs and in the mind at Wimbledon this year. After a three-set tussle with her Romanian compatriot Mihaela Buzarnescu in the second round, she has won her last four matches in straight sets.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">She dealt the former No. 1 Victoria Azarenka a lopsided defeat in the third round, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/sports/tennis/coco-gauff-simona-halep-wimbledon.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">stopped the 15-year-old American Coco Gauff’s run</a> in the fourth round and defeated Zhang Shuai of China in the quarterfinals.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In this form and mood, she could pose a threat to Williams in Saturday’s final. Williams was edgy in her two major finals last year as she chased her 24th singles title. But she has a 9-1 record against Halep and won their most recent encounter, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/sports/serena-williams-simona-halep-australian-open.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">beating Halep in three sets</a> in the round of 16 of this year’s Australian Open.</p>',\n",

       " 'women-athlete-marketing-wasserman': {'article_body': '<p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Trying to take advantage of the ascendance of women athletes and the popularity of the most recent Women’s World Cup champions, one of the country’s leading sports agencies is forming a new division to work with companies to market to women through sports.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The sports and talent agency Wasserman, which represents more than half the members of the United States women’s national team including Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, will announce Thursday it is creating The Collective, a unit whose goal is to connect major companies, consumers and fans of every gender with some of the country’s best known female athletes.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“We believe there is a significant opportunity for the athletes to attract meaningfully more marketing engagement and awareness and dollars,” said Casey Wasserman, the company’s founder, in an interview last week.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Hundreds of thousands of fans turned out to celebrate the women’s soccer team Wednesday in New York City, where team members and fans chanted “equal pay” together, highlighting how closely this team has connected itself to the business of its sport.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rapinoe said she understands the opportunities that are now available to her and her teammates.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“I am fortunate to play soccer in a time where the women who came before me made such an impact on the sport,” Rapinoe wrote in an email earlier this week, shortly after leading the U.S. women to a second consecutive world championship. Because of these women, Rapinoe said, she has “seen more acceptance, more acknowledgment and support which has certainly led to more opportunity.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Characteristic of someone who is <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/sports/megan-rapinoe-trump-world-cup.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">never afraid to speak her mind</a> and has <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">sued her employer for gender discrimination</a>, however, Rapinoe doesn’t believe those increased opportunities are enough. “We are still not nearly where we need to be,” she wrote.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wasserman is hoping The Collective can help remedy that. In addition to Rapinoe and Morgan, Wasserman’s clients include prominent basketball players like Sue Bird and Maya Moore, Katie Ledecky, the world’s most dominant swimmer, and Hilary Knight, a top hockey player.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Wasserman also advises companies that want to market in sports and entertainment, whether with Wasserman represented athletes or others. Elizabeth Lindsey, Wasserman’s president of brands and properties, said she has seen an evolution in how companies advertise to women through sports.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“In the early days of my career in sports marketing, it never occurred to brands to talk to women,” she said. Even when companies would market to women through sports, it would be to the mom who makes Super Bowl snacks or the wife who is dragged to the game. Women were typecast as supporting players to sports fandom, and not as sports fans in their own right.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">But Lindsey believes that is changing because of the power of women consumers. “They control the purse strings, they are passionate and prevalent as fans and the most important part is what is happening recently, which is they have a voice and are radically unafraid to use it,” said Lindsey.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rapinoe is one of a growing number of female American athletes who have become stars, and in many cases outshine their male counterparts. Morgan and Rapinoe are better known than most of the men’s national soccer team, and American women regularly win more Olympic medals than American men. In sports like tennis, running and gymnastics, the most famous American athletes are women.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">In addition to running his company, Casey Wasserman is the chairman of L.A. 2028, the local organizing committee for the 2028 Olympics. In that capacity he will be a part of the entity that is <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/sports/nbc-olympics.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">selling advertising</a> for the United States Olympic Committee and the three preceding Olympics as well. He said there was no conflict of interest between representing and selling L.A. 2028, and representing potential Olympic athletes and securing sponsorships for them through efforts like The Collective.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Obviously they are completely separate entities, and lines we draw very clearly,” he said. “I’m a volunteer for L.A. 2028, I don’t get paid,” he said, adding that, “L.A. 2028 in its bylaws will never hire Wasserman for any business, period.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Structurally, The Collective will have a small staff dedicated to its day-to-day operations, with various Wasserman executives and agents working on The Collective projects. Athletes will still be represented by their agents, but they will also be supported by The Collective. The task is a nuanced one.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It is not as simple as telling potential sponsors that girls and women follow women’s sports, and therefore companies should use women athletes to reach them. During the most recent Women’s World Cup, countless boys and men rooted for the American women just as strenuously as their sisters, wives and daughters.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Men and women “care equally about sports, they just consume it in different ways for different reasons,” said Lindsey. To figure out what those reasons are, she said, just ask them. “The best way to talk to women, is to talk to women.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Lindsey said competition within this segment of the market could grow quickly, which is something she and colleagues welcome. “I hope more people pay attention to this,” she said. “I hope people realize what a valuable demographic this audience is.”</p>',\n",

They brought posters and flags, decked out in jerseys, beads and face paint. These were the little girls — and boys — that came to Lower Manhattan to catch a glimpse at the United States women’s national soccer team.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">For the second time in four years, the team was honored with a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/sports/soccer/soccer-parade.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">ticker-tape parade</a> down the Canyon of Heroes on Wednesday after <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/sports/soccer/world-cup-final-uswnt.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fsoccer&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=soccer&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=5&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\" title=\"\">winning the Women’s World Cup, this time in France</a> on Sunday. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">It wasn’t just young girls cherishing their success this year, it was an entire generation of soccer players and sports fans. One of the more lasting effects of this team may be its appeal across gender lines, seemingly obliterating whatever remained of the anachronistic tendency of boys and men to resist rooting for women’s teams. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Watching them is fun and they are very inspiring,” said David Winters, 10. “Sometimes I follow the men, but not normally. I like the women better.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">He came to the parade with two cousins from Westchester. They made their own custom shirts Tuesday. His had the name of his favorite player — man or woman — on the back. It’s Tobin Heath.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Throughout the tournament, the team was criticized for its goal celebrations, especially after a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/sports/soccer/a-rout-too-far-after-13-0-win-us-is-criticized-and-defended.html?searchResultPosition=7&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">13-0 victory over Thailand</a> in the opening match. Lorenzo Andrade, 12, was not among the critics. That’s actually the major reason he likes them. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“Their celebrations are awesome,” he said. “They don’t care what people think.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Brady Chase, 10, came from Cape Cod. He plays soccer and loves Alex Morgan — her attitude, her toughness. He has been following this team for the past three years. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">There was purple hair everywhere, styled after <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/sports/soccer/megan-rapinoe-uswnt-world-cup-final.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fsoccer&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=soccer&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=4&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\" title=\"\">Megan Rapinoe</a>, winner of the golden boot as the top scorer in the tournament and the golden ball as the top player. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/d_allentuck/status/1148919126699782144\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">Izzy Chau, 10</a>, loves soccer, loves Rapinoe and wants to be on the U.S. national team one day. She woke up early to make sure her purple hairstyle was perfect. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Adults were there too, and many took off work to cheer them along Broadway. Maggie Menchaca flew from Los Angeles to New York on a red-eye just for the parade and was scheduled to return to California on Wednesday night. She watched from the stands when the Americans won the World Cup in 1999 and 2015. She missed this year’s tournament in France because she was moving, but she wasn’t going to let anything stop her from going to the parade. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s such a cohesive environment and so positive, I just love it,” Menchaca said. “There’s nothing like it.”</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\"><a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/sports/soccer/world-cup-equal-pay.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fsoccer&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=soccer&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;pgtype=sectionfront\" title=\"\">Equal pay</a> was a hot topic throughout the entire day, with chants and signs lining the parade route. Kacie Horstman safety pinned a piece of paper that said “EQUAL PAY” in all caps to the back of her jersey.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“It’s not just about the salaries but the prize money, too. The disparity is crazy,” said Horstman, 26, a former recreational player who took off from her job in central New Jersey to celebrate. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">FIFA doubled the prize money for this summer’s Women’s World Cup, to $30 million, but the women’s total bonus pool remains a fraction of the $400 million that the 32 men’s World Cup teams — which for the first time in a generation did not include the United States — shared in 2018.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">The celebrations continued on the steps of City Hall, with Morgan bringing back her sipping tea move from when she scored against England and Rapinoe throwing her arms out wide. One parade goer spent the past two days crafting a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/d_allentuck/status/1148943493265575936\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">full-size version of Rapinoe’s pose out of Styrofoam </a>to bring with her. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">Rapinoe ended the day with a simple message for the crowd: “We have to be better, we have to love more and hate less. Listen more and talk less.

Gripping a bottle of champagne in one hand and a World Cup trophy in the other, she beamed. “I deserve this!” she said.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">New York City, led by its mayor, Bill de Blasio, who is running for president, went all out for the event. Homemade ticker tape filled the air. </p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">When the team arrived at City Hall, they found a sea of cheering, ebullient paradegoers. Many wore the white jersey of their favorite player.</p><p class=\"css-exrw3m evys1bk0\">“This is one of the best days of my life,” one young girl told midfielder Sam Mewis, inside City Hall’s marbled rotunda.
