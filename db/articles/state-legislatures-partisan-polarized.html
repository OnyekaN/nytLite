{'body': '[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When J.B. Pritzker took over as the governor of Illinois this year, Democratic lawmakers, who had spent four years at an impasse with his Republican predecessor, vowed that their party\\u2019s new grip on the State Capitol would bring immediate change.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The pace has been startling. In recent months, Illinois legislators have moved sharply to the left, deeming abortion a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/101/SB/10100SB0025ham001.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">fundamental right</a> for women no matter what the Supreme Court might decide, raising the minimum wage, taking steps to legalize recreational marijuana and introducing a graduated income tax.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some 700 miles to the south, the Alabama State Capitol, dominated by Republicans, has raced in the opposite direction.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Alabama lawmakers voted during this term to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/abortion-law-alabama.html?module=inline" title="">ban most abortions</a>. They <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/SB69/2019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">eliminated marriage licenses</a>, so that probate judges opposed to same-sex marriage would not have to sign marriage certificates. And they approved requiring sex offenders who commit crimes involving children to undergo <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/HB379/2019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">chemical castration</a> at their own expense.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama, a fellow Republican, earlier signed the abortion and marriage license bills, and on Monday her office announced that she had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/chemical-castration-alabama.html?module=inline" title="">signed the castration legislation</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Read about what </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/chemical-castration-alabama.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">chemical castration means in Alabama</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is the first time in more than a century that all but one state legislature is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/ncslorg/status/1060137062853160961?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">dominated by a single party</a>. Most legislative sessions have ended or are scheduled to end in a matter of days in capitals across the nation, and Republican-held states have rushed forward with conservative agendas as those controlled by Democrats have pushed through liberal ones.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Any hope that single-party control in the states might ease the tone of political discourse has not borne out. Lopsided party dominance has not brought resignation; instead of minority parties conceding that they lack the numbers to effectively fight back, the mood has grown more tense and vitriolic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe whole nation is speaking about how divisive we are,\\u201d Thomas Jackson, a Democrat in the Alabama House of Representatives, told colleagues during a contentious meeting last month.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Oregon, where Democrats control state government, Republicans <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-republican-senate-shutdown-education-funding-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">boycotted </a>sessions for several days over disagreements about taxes and gun control. In Tennessee, where Republicans are in charge, Democrats staged a walkout during a heated and chaotic budget debate, and Republicans <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/02/tennessee-general-assembly-final-days-111-th-legislative-session-house-senate-republicans-democrats/3615928002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ordered the police</a> to go find them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In New York, the State Legislature passed several laws that had been blocked in previous years by Republicans, who lost control of the Senate earlier this year after a decade in power. Those measures included a law <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/nyregion/child-sex-abuse-victims.html?module=inline" title="">extending the period of time</a> for victims of childhood sexual abuse to file lawsuits, and several others <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/nyregion/gun-laws-new-york.html?module=inline" title="">restricting the use of firearms</a>, including bans on bump stocks and teachers carrying guns in schools.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And in Colorado, where Democrats dominate in the capital, Republicans were so upset about the stream of new laws being passed that they demanded each bill be read aloud to slow the pace. Democrats responded by having five computers <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/samuelbrasch/status/1105211490938716160/video/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">simultaneously \\u201cread\\u201d bills</a>.

They won in court, but Democrats went on \\u2014 at a moderated pace \\u2014 to pass legislation that many Republicans opposed, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb18-1274" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reducing greenhouse gas emissions</a>, banning <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/us/gay-conversion-therapy-colorado.html?module=inline" title="">gay conversion therapy</a> for minors and creating a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2019A/bills/2019a_1168_ren.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reinsurance program</a> to lower health care costs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This year was always <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/democrats-gun-control-healthcare.html?module=inline" title="">poised to be contentious</a> in statehouses. Across the nation, nearly 1,700 new lawmakers won seats in last fall\\u2019s elections. The vast majority of the newcomers were Democrats, who won control of six new legislative chambers, meaning that they now dominate both chambers in 18 states. But Republicans continue to control the majority of state legislatures, with 29. (Two states, Nebraska and Alaska, do not easily fit the model, although both are also dominated by Republicans.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Analysts said that issues addressed by state legislatures this year, which included <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6174/Overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">gun control</a>, health care, education and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB392" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">police procedures</a>, might have more immediate, lasting effect than anything approved in Washington, D.C., where government is divided.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The roots of the polarization in state legislatures can be traced to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ballotpedia.org/State_legislative_elections,_2010" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">elections in 2010</a>, when Republicans made decisive gains in statehouses and pressed for policies that included restricting labor unions and abortion access, while expanding gun rights, according to Sarah F. Anzia, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Around the same time, Dr. Anzia said, national organizations representing interest groups ranging from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.aft.org/action/election-2018" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">teachers</a> to gun owners became more active in state capitals, because they found it far easier to make headway in places like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nraila.org/legal-legislation/state-legislation/california/2019/february-2019-litigation-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Sacramento</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wvea.org/content/tax-reform-committee-updated-june-15-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Charleston, W.Va., </a>than in Washington because of gridlock in Congress.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The number of states with either supermajorities of Democrats that also have Democratic governors (California, Nevada and Oregon, among others) or Republicans with Republican governors (Alabama, Ohio and Tennessee, among others) has grown, too, meaning that many lawmakers rarely feel the need to compromise.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cIf you are a Republican in one state, you are probably going to be pushing the same agenda as a Republican in another state, and the same is true for Democrats,\\u201d said Dr. Anzia. \\u201cThat hasn\\u2019t always been true, and the result is that now more than ever, state legislatures are key players in these partisan battles over politics.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Minnesota, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/democrats-gun-control-healthcare.html?module=inline" title="">only state </a>left with a divided legislature, promises of bipartisanship sometimes devolved into stalemate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During a budget standoff last month, Tim Walz, the Democratic governor who campaigned last year on a pledge to work across the aisle, angrily denounced Republicans for blocking gun control efforts and supporting deep tax cuts, saying those policies \\u201cfit better in Mississippi and Alabama than they do in Minnesota.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ultimately, Democrats could win neither new gun laws nor new tax increases, and Republicans also failed to win approval for the bulk of their agenda.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, once the session ended last month, Governor Walz said that \\u201cMinnesota is showing the rest of the nation that Republicans and Democrats can still find compromise and work together to get things done,\\u201d citing spending increases for public education and efforts to fight opioid addiction.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Alabama and Illinois \\u2014 one overwhelmingly red, the other blue \\u2014 were more representative of this year\\u2019s tone, providing perhaps the best examples of political parties moving to enact utterly different agendas.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After Alabama <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/abortion-law-alabama.html?module=inline" title=""> effectively banned abortion</a> last month, female lawmakers in Illinois responded almost immediately, pressing through a bill expanding abortion rights in their state. (Abortion rights groups have sued to stop the Alabama law from taking effect.) And while Illinois voted to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocTypeID=SB&amp;DocNum=3432&amp;GAID=14&amp;SessionID=91&amp;LegID=111418" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">allow sports betting</a> and to legalize recreational marijuana, Alabama failed to approve either a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/SB220/2019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">state lottery</a> or medical marijuana.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was Alabama\\u2019s abortion measure, the strictest in the nation, that sparked the most contentious debate of any legislation this session.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During debates in the Legislature, Rolanda Hollis, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, read a poem to colleagues called <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/if-my-vagina-was-gun-revives-tradition-protest-poetry/313217/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">\\u201cIf My Vagina Was a Gun\\u201d</a> that she said illustrated Alabama\\u2019s consistent protection of Second Amendment rights but not abortion rights.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bobby Singleton, a Senate Democrat, told his Republican colleagues that they had \\u201caborted\\u201d and \\u201craped\\u201d Alabama by supporting the legislation, which was approved generally along party lines.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Terry Lathan, the chair of the Alabama Republican Party, downplayed the uproar over the abortion bill, saying she had seen worse \\u2014 including when a Republican senator <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knXgcd_iAUg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">punched</a> a Democratic colleague on the Senate floor in 2007.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThis is the political arena,\\u201d she said. \\u201cEveryone needs to put on their big girl and boy pants. I mean, come on!\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Illinois, Republicans were in much the same position as Democrats in Alabama: Outnumbered and outflanked. And like Alabama Democrats, Illinois Republicans lost nearly every vote of significance.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to voting to raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2025, the state legislature became the first in the nation to pass a bill legalizing both the sale and possession of marijuana. (In other states, voters have approved such laws through ballot initiatives.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dale Righter, a Republican in the Illinois Senate, said that without power, Republicans\\u2019 hopes relied on conservative Democratic voters deciding that their lawmakers had gone too far.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI have no doubt that there are Democratic voters saying, \\u2018Hey, this isn\\u2019t what I signed up for,\\u2019\\u201d he said.</p>]]', 'link': '/2019/06/11/us/state-legislatures-partisan-polarized.html#commentsContainer', 'title': '<title data-rh="true">With Most States Under One Party\xe2\x80\x99s Control, America Grows More Divided - The New York Times</title>'}
