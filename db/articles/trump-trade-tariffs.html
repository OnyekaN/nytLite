At this point, evidence that Trump tweets are sound and fury signifying nothing is, in effect, good news.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Let\\u2019s review what happened. First, having gone to great lengths to get a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada \\u2014 an agreement that was very similar to the existing agreement, but one he could slap his own name on \\u2014 Trump basically blew up his position by threatening to impose new tariffs unless Mexico did something about border issues that have nothing to do with trade.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This obviously weakens if it doesn\\u2019t destroy Trump\\u2019s ability to negotiate future agreements, on trade or anything else. After all, what\\u2019s the point of making deals with an administration that reneges on its promises whenever it feels like it?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But then, barely a week later, Trump called the whole thing off in return for a statement by Mexico that it would do \\u2026 things it had already agreed to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmaggie-haberman&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">months earlier</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We don\\u2019t know exactly what caused Trump to back down, but a good guess is that the warnings of U.S. manufacturers \\u2014 horrified at the possibility that Trump\\u2019s tariff tantrum would disrupt their supply chains \\u2014 finally made it through to the Oval Office, or the golf course, or wherever he was when they finally got his ear.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/paul-krugman?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[For an even deeper look at what\\u2019s on Paul Krugman\\u2019s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]</em></a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, not having a destructive trade war is a good thing. But what the world learned from this climbdown is that Trump\\u2019s threats are as empty as his promises.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An aside: Recent events have surely reduced the chances that Congress will ever approve the U.S.M.C.A., the Trump-negotiated replacement for Nafta.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Democrats in the House were already reluctant to pass enabling legislation, giving Trump something to boast about, unless they got some serious concessions on issues that matter to them, like labor rights. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump\\u2019s counter was a threat to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/us/politics/trump-withdraw-nafta.html?module=inline" title="">withdraw from Nafta</a> with no replacement. But this would have catastrophic economic effects, leading into an election year. After last week\\u2019s climbdown, who believes that he would carry through on that threat?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump was, of course, unhappy at news reports that accurately described his deal with Mexico over migrants as the nothingburger (nothingtaco?) it actually was. So in addition to lashing out at \\u201cfake news,\\u201d he introduced a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-08/mexico-never-agreed-to-farm-deal-with-u-s-contradicting-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">whole new claim</a>: \\u201cMEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There were a few peculiar things about that claim, despite the extra persuasiveness that always comes when YOU MAKE YOUR ASSERTIONS IN CAPITAL LETTERS. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like many Trump tweets, it reads like a clumsy translation from the original Russian (\\u201cgreat patriot farmers\\u201d?). More to the point, there was nothing at all about agriculture in the official agreement. And at the most basic level, that\\u2019s just not something the Mexican government could deliver, even if it wanted to.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some readers may recall that a few months ago China tried to avert trade conflict by promising to buy 10 million tons of U.S. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-23/china-s-pledge-for-u-s-soy-buying-catches-traders-off-guard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">soybeans</a>. The ploy didn\\u2019t work, but it was at least feasible: State-owned enterprises make up a large part of the Chinese economy, and Beijing can just order them to buy stuff. Mexico, however, is a market economy, in which the private sector, not the government, decides how much Iowa corn to import.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So was Trump confusing Mexico with China? Did he forget that the China deal he was touting months ago actually fell through? Who knows? </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What\\u2019s clear, however, is that on trade policy \\u2014 his signature issue \\u2014 the president of the United States is seriously out to lunch. And you might think that this would worry investors.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as I said, markets appear to be celebrating: As I write this, stock markets are up, while long-term interest rates \\u2014 a better barometer of investor views about economic prospects \\u2014 are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-08/donald-trump-unleashed-animal-spirits-and-then-he-crushed-them" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">off their recent lows</a>. What\\u2019s going on?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The answer, I\\u2019d suggest, is that financial markets are basically discounting Trump\\u2019s rants; they\\u2019ve stopped treating evidence of his unfitness for office as news. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, he\\u2019s deeply ignorant about policy. Yes, his rage-tweets constantly remind us of his egomania and insecurity. But we\\u2019ve known all that for a while; Trump\\u2019s personality is, in effect, already priced in.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What investors want to know instead is the extent to which his character flaws will actually lead to destructive economic policy. Legally, Trump faces remarkably few constraints: U.S. trade law gives the president enormous discretion to impose tariffs at will, and given a spineless Senate, there are a lot of other things he can do in the name of national security. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as of right now, markets appear to be betting that he tweets loudly but carries a small stick.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Is this a good bet? I have my doubts. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The trade war with China still seems to be on, and Europe may be next. More generally, when you have an attention-seeking president, ignoring his antics could well provoke him into even more extreme behavior. But for now, investors are effectively treating Trump as crazy but harmless. Is America great, or what?</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
