The workers followed protocol and waited for the shingles they worked on to cool, but the fire broke out soon after they left, just before 5 a.m.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The flames eventually reached Building 6197, known as the video vault, which housed videotapes, film reels and, crucially, a library of master sound recordings owned by Universal Music Group. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hundreds of firefighters responded to the fire. After trying to douse it with foam retardant and water from a nearby lake, emergency personnel decided to dismantle the warehouse containing the vault to more easily put out the fire.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Musicians </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/universal-music-fire-musician-reactions.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">mourned the fiery destruction</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> of their recordings.]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Almost all of the master recordings stored in the vault were destroyed in the fire, including those produced by some of the most famous musicians since the 1940s. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a confidential report in 2009, Universal Music Group estimated the loss at about 500,000 song titles.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The lost works most likely included masters in the Decca Records collection by Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and Judy Garland. The fire probably also claimed some of Chuck Berry\\u2019s greatest recordings, produced for Chess Records, as well as the masters of some of Aretha Franklin\\u2019s first appearances on record.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Almost of all of Buddy Holly\\u2019s masters were lost, as were most of John Coltrane\\u2019s masters in the Impulse Records collection. The fire also claimed numerous hit singles, likely including Bill Haley and His Comets\\u2019 \\u201cRock Around the Clock,\\u201d Etta James\\u2019s \\u201cAt Last\\u201d and the Kingsmen\\u2019s \\u201cLouie Louie.\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The list of artists affected spans decades of popular music. It includes recordings by Ray Charles, B.B. King, the Four Tops, Joan Baez, Neil Diamond, Sonny and Cher, Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Al Green, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Buffett, the Eagles, Aerosmith, Rufus and Chaka Khan, Barry White, Patti LaBelle, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Police, Sting, Steve Earle, R.E.M., Janet Jackson, Guns N\\u2019 Roses, Mary J. Blige, No Doubt, Nine Inch Nails, Snoop Dogg, Nirvana, Beck, Sheryl Crow, Tupac Shakur, Eminem, 50 Cent and the Roots.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A master recording is the one-of-a-kind original recording of a piece of music. <!-- -->It\\u2019s the source from which other vinyl records, CDs, MP3s and all other recordings are made. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to the article, documents show that the vault contained masters dating back decades, including multitrack recordings on which individual instruments remained isolated from one another. There were also session masters, including recordings that had never been commercially released. The recordings within the vault came from to some of the most important record labels of all time<!-- -->.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Audiophiles and audio professionals view such recordings with special regard.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cA master is the truest capture of a piece of recorded music,\\u201d Adam Block, the former president of Legacy Recordings, Sony Music Entertainment\\u2019s catalog arm, told the magazine. \\u201cSonically, masters can be stunning in their capturing of an event in time. Every copy thereafter is a sonic step away.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the time, the fire made news around the world, and the vault featured heavily in that coverage. But most articles focused only on the video recordings in the archive and, even then, news outlets largely characterized the disaster as a crisis averted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jody Rosen, the writer of the article, described the successful effort to play down the scope of the loss as a \\u201ctriumph of crisis management\\u201d that involved officials working for Universal Music Group on both coasts. Those efforts were undoubtedly aimed at minimizing public embarrassment, but some suggest the company was also particularly worried about a backlash from artists and artist estates whose master recordings had been destroyed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The real extent of the loss was laid out in litigation and company documents obtained by Mr. Rosen, a contributing writer for the magazine. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Rosen described the loss as historic, and even Universal Music Group itself \\u2014 privately \\u2014 viewed what happened in bleak terms: \\u201cLost in the fire was, undoubtedly, a huge musical heritage,\\u201d reads one 2009 internal assessment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Record companies have had a troubled history with such recordings and have been known to trash them in bulk. Decades ago, employees of CBS Records reportedly took power saws to multitrack masters to sell the reels as scrap metal. In the 1970s, RCA destroyed masters by Elvis Presley in a broader purge.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because of that history, industry professionals have long questioned how committed the major music labels are to preserving what they see as priceless artifacts. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today, most commercial recordings from the past century and beyond are controlled by only three giant record companies: Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and, of course, Universal Music Group.</p>]]', 'link': '/2019/06/11/us/master-recordings-universal-fire.html', 'title': '<title data-rh="true">Recordings by Elton John, Nirvana and Thousands More Lost in Fire - The New York Times</title>'}
