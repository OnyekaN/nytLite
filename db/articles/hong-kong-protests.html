One example is a draft law to criminalize <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/world/asia/china-yang-kaili-anthem.html?module=inline" title="">disrespect for the Chinese national anthem</a>; another is the disappearance of people from Hong Kong into mainland custody.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/world/asia/hong-kong-china-extradition-protest.html?module=inline" title="">The extradition measure </a>was initially presented as needed to send a Hong Kong man to Taiwan, where he allegedly killed his girlfriend. But to the democracy-minded people of Hong Kong, this was only cover for a portion of the bill that would also allow extradition to mainland China, which would enable Chinese authorities to pry political foes from Hong Kong by leveling false accusations and demanding their extradition. That, in effect, would extend China\\u2019s reach into Hong Kong and strip its residents of the protection of the law.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sunday\\u2019s protesters vowed to be back in the streets when the bill next comes before the legislature. If Ms. Lam really believes they are acting out of concern for \\u201cthe next generation,\\u201d she would do well to heed them and shelve this cynical assault on Hong Kong\\u2019s rule of law.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
