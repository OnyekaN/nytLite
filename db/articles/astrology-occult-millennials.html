{'body': '[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We\\u2019re living in the middle of a religious revival; it\\u2019s just that the movements that are rising are not what we normally call \\u201creligion.\\u201d The first rising movement is astrology. According to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/01/new-age-beliefs-common-among-both-religious-and-nonreligious-americans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">2018 Pew poll</a>, 29 percent of Americans say they believe in astrology. That\\u2019s more than are members of mainline Protestant churches.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This surge in belief is primarily among the young. According to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/assets/404/science-and-technology-public-attitudes-and-understanding_atables.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">National Science Foundation survey</a>, 44 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds say that astrology is somewhat or very \\u201cscientific.\\u201d Unsurprisingly, online horoscope sites are booming. Stella Bugbee, editor of The Cut, told <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-new-age-of-astrology/550034/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Atlantic</a> that in 2017 the typical horoscope got 150 percent more traffic than it had the year before.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another surging spiritual movement is witchcraft. In 1990, only 8,000 Americans self-identified as Wiccans. Ten years later there were 134,000, and today, along with other neo-pagans, there are over a million. As Tara Isabella Burton put it in an excellent, deeply researched <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/06/07/the-rise-of-progressive-occultism/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">essay</a> in The American Interest, \\u201cWicca, by that estimation, is technically the fastest-growing religion in America.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The third great rising spiritual force is mindfulness, which seems to be everywhere. The fourth is wokeness, what some have called the Great Awokening. Burton\\u2019s essay is really about how astrology and witchcraft have become important spiritual vocabularies within parts of the social justice movement. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In March, she wrote, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shared her birth time with the astrologer Arthur Lipp-Bonewits, who then shared her birth chart with the world, creating an online sensation. \\u201cAOC\\u2019s Aries Moon indicates that she\\u2019s emotionally fed by a certain amount of independence, self-determination, and spontaneity,\\u201d Jeanna Kadlec <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.allure.com/story/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-astrology-birth-chart-reading" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">wrote</a> in Allure.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the Kavanaugh hearings, 13,000 \\u201cresistance witches\\u201d cast a hex on Brett Kavanaugh. There is now a plethora of guidebooks for how to use astrology and witchcraft to advance left-wing causes. They have names like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738759968" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">\\u201cMagic for Resistance: Rituals and Spells for Change\\u201d</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://revelore.press/product/the-new-aradia-a-witchs-handbook-to-magical-resistance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">\\u201cThe New Aradia: A Witch\\u2019s Handbook to Magical Resistance.\\u201d</a> </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These surging movements are people\\u2019s attempts to solve the major needs of the current moment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first need is simply to find a way to be spiritual. People are always saying we live in a more secular age, but secularism never really comes. Humans are transcendent creatures who have spiritual experiences and instinctively appeal to supernatural powers. Even in the most secular parts of society, there is great and unfulfilled spiritual yearning.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Second, there is a widespread need to slow down, to escape the pace of life technology wants and to live at a human pace.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Third, there is a widespread need to express alienation. Interest in the occult rises during periods of transition and disillusion. It happened in the late 1960s, and it\\u2019s happening today. For many, the traditional organized religions are implicated in the existing power structures. Being occult is a way to announce that you stand on the fringe of society, that you stand against the patriarchy, against the heteronormative culture and against the structures of oppression. Political alienation manifests itself in the alt-right and the energized radical left. It makes sense that it would manifest itself in the spiritual realm, too.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fourth is the need for identity markers. We live at a time when many of the traditional sources of identity (ethnicity, rooted neighborhood) are being erased. Astrology tells you who you are and what traits you have. In a highly diverse society, it also tells you what sort of people you\\u2019re likely to be compatible and incompatible with. When I hear people talk about astrology, this is how they are<!-- --> using it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fifth is the desire to live within a coherent creed and community, but without having that creed impinge on your individual autonomy. Being an Orthodox Jew is a thick but binding life. The emerging spirituality is a hodgepodge spirituality. Each person borrows practices from, say, Native American, Buddhist, Christian, Jewish and SoulCycle traditions and blends them in a way he or she finds moving. There is no grand narrative, no specific way one is expected to live, no <!-- -->set of laws you have to obey or even a<!-- --> specific cult leader who might boss you around. Religion bows before individualism.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finally, many people seem to want to be alternative without actually leaving the mainstream world. The people I know who talk about astrology sort of believe it, but they sort of don\\u2019t. Their attitude is ironical, attached and detached all at once.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even the occultists are not really that countercultural. For example, David Salisbury\\u2019s book <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578636570" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">\\u201cWitchcraft Activism: A Toolkit for Magical Resistance\\u201d</a> is surprisingly normal. Salisbury gives standard advice on how to be an activist. It\\u2019s just that he asks you to say a prayer to Hermes, the messenger god, when you send an important email.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I doubt that much of this will be sustainable. I doubt it\\u2019s possible to have tight community and also total autonomy, that it\\u2019s possible to detach spiritual practices from the larger narratives and cultures and still have something life-shaping. But society is groaning. New forms are coming into being. We really are living through a moment of major transitional change.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
