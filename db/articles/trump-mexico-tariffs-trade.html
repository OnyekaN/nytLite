{'body': '[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Remember that time when Donald Trump was going to win the Nobel Peace Prize for ending the threat of nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was almost exactly a year ago. The president was about to meet North Korea\\u2019s Kim Jong-un in Singapore. A group of House Republicans nominated the president for a Nobel Peace Prize. The crowd chanted \\u201cNo-bel!\\u201d at a Trump rally.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the end, the main achievement of the summit, a propaganda victory for North Korea, was mollifying Trump, who\\u2019d been threatening nuclear holocaust. Kim Jong-un agreed to work toward denuclearization, but as even casual news consumers know, the North Korean definition of denuclearization includes the lifting of the American nuclear umbrella over Northeast Asia. Actual North Korean concessions were minimal.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nevertheless, from the right arose a thundering, bullying demand that Trump be given credit. And a few progressives cautioned against making too much of the summit\\u2019s inadequacy, arguing, in part, that it was better for Trump to get suckered and claim victory than to lash out. Democratic critics of the summit, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/trump-kim-jong-un-summit/562934/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">wrote The Atlantic\\u2019s Peter Beinart,</a> risked becoming \\u201cde facto allies of ultra-hawks like John Bolton,\\u201d who wants to discredit diplomacy with North Korea.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a fair enough point, but also a tacit acknowledgment of the inescapable degradation of living under this president, which often feels like being stuck in a house with an unstable and abusive father. You can either placate him by humoring his delusions, or puncture them and risk unpredictable fallout. The choices are complicity or destruction.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nytimes.com/theargument?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Listen to \\u201cThe Argument\\u201d podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Which brings us to Trump\\u2019s recent deal \\u2014 or \\u201cdeal\\u201d \\u2014 with Mexico. Once again, Trump made a series of unhinged threats against another country, leading to high-stakes diplomacy, and the announcement of a breakthrough. Once again, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/08/with-mexico-deal-trump-deals-another-blow-media-elites/?utm_term=.3bad80a8238f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">chest-beating conservatives jeered</a> at Democrats for refusing to concede that Trump\\u2019s belligerence had borne fruit. Once again, when the details were revealed, it became obvious that Trump had accomplished very little of any substance. And once again, Trump has created a situation where it\\u2019s hazardous for his opponents to say too much about his incompetence.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Friday, as the clock ticked down to Trump\\u2019s threatened imposition of 5 percent tariffs on Mexican goods, the two countries announced a last-minute deal. The U.S. would hold off on imposing the levies, and Mexico would take action to deter Central American migrants. For a moment, it looked as if Trump had cowed America\\u2019s neighbor with his madman foreign policy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But giving Trump the benefit of the doubt is almost always a mistake. The president had claimed, using the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1137329348409778177" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">floridly Stalinesque language</a> we\\u2019ve all had to become accustomed to, that Mexico had agreed to \\u201cIMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!\\u201d This <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/9/18658768/mexico-us-trade-tariffs-ambassador-coqui-trump-agricultural-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">appears to be untrue</a>. In fact, as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer" title="">The New York Times reported on Saturday</a>, the deal consisted \\u201clargely of actions that Mexico had already promised to take in prior discussions with the United States.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Months ago, Mexico consented to expanding a program in which migrants seeking asylum in the United States wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated, and to deploying more of its national guard to block migrants. It looks as if negotiators of the deal made on Friday <!-- -->simply<!-- --> ramped up the scale of these agreements to give Trump a face-saving way to back down from tariffs that threatened the American economy as well as the Mexican one.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As it became clear \\u2014 at least to those outside the Fox News bubble \\u2014 how little Trump had achieved, he grew even <!-- -->more<!-- --> splutteringly incoherent than usual. \\u201cMexico was not being cooperative on the Border in things we had, or didn\\u2019t have,\\u201d until the deal, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1137697505683091461" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">he wrote in one tweet.</a> Trump went on to claim that Mexico had made <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1138030976578310144" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">further, secret concessions</a> that would be revealed at a later date, which <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/immigration-mexico-deal-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">Mexico\\u2019s foreign minister denied</a>. (<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/10/trump-mexico-trade-agreement-1358723" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Some have reported</a> that Trump was referring to a potential regional pact on asylum that would include Central and South American countries and the United Nations, which Mexico said it could be open to discussing.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All this was just the latest demonstration that, personal branding to the contrary, the president is terrible at making deals. What he\\u2019s good at is what might be called deal theater \\u2014 made-for-TV melodramas with self-generated crises, over-the-top demands, and suspenseful arbitrary deadlines. The point of these exercises isn\\u2019t to solve a problem, but to pacify Trump with the illusion that he is winning so that he doesn\\u2019t feel the need to break anything.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The question for everyone else is whether to play along, because Trump is less dangerous if he thinks Mexico has submitted. Until now, the president has regularly stoked his nativist base by treating the humanitarian emergency at the border as a security threat. Now he has an interest in exaggerating the degree to which the problem has been solved, just as he now plays down North Korea\\u2019s nuclear capabilities rather than admit his own failure.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facing widespread mockery for his Potemkin deal, Trump tweeted on Monday that if Mexico\\u2019s legislature fails to enact the provisions of its purported secret agreement with the U.S., the tariffs will go into effect. There\\u2019s an implicit threat here: Don\\u2019t provoke him. If he doesn\\u2019t get the headlines he wants, there\\u2019s no telling what he might do.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
