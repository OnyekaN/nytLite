{'body': '[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It starts with a burger.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2008 a Dutch professor named Mark Post presented the proof of concept for what he called \\u201ccultured meat.\\u201d Five years later, in a London TV studio, Mr. Post and his colleagues ate a burger they had grown from animal cells in a laboratory. Secretly funded by Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, the journey from petri dish to plate had cost $325,000 \\u2014 making theirs the most expensive meal in history. Fortunately, the results were promising: Hanni R\\xfctzler, a nutrition scientist, concluded that the patty was \\u201c<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23996-whats-the-beef-cultured-meat-remains-a-distant-dream/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">close to meat but not as juicy</a>.\\u201d The next question was whether this breakthrough could be made cheaper. Much cheaper.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first \\u201ccultured <!-- -->beef<!-- -->\\u201d burgers are likely to enter the market next year, at approximately $50 each. But that won\\u2019t last long. Within a decade they will probably be more affordable than even the cheapest barbecue staples of today \\u2014 all for a product that uses fewer resources, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2011-06-21-lab-grown-meat-would-cut-emissions-and-save-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">produces negligible greenhouse gases</a> and, remarkably, requires no animals to die.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It\\u2019s not just barbecues and burgers. Last year Just, a leader in cellular agriculture, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2018/12/11/JUST-strikes-deal-in-Japan-to-bring-cell-cultured-Wagyu-beef-to-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cut a deal</a> to start producing one of the world\\u2019s tastiest steaks, Wagyu. A company called Endless West, which also makes grapeless wine, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://endlesswest.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">has started to produce Glyph</a>, the world\\u2019s first \\u201cmolecular whiskey.\\u201d Luxury could be coming to all.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The case of cultured food and drink, far from a curiosity, is a template for a better, freer and more affluent world, a world where we provide for the needs of everyone \\u2014 in style.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But how do we get there?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To say the present era is one of crisis borders on clich\\xe9. It differs from the dystopias of George Orwell or Aldous Huxley, or hell in the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. It is unlike Europe during the Black Death or Central Asia as it faced the Mongols. And yet it is true: Ours is an age of crisis. We inhabit a world of low growth, low productivity and low wages, of climate breakdown and the collapse of democratic politics. A world where billions, mostly in the global south, live in poverty. A world defined by inequality.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the most pressing crisis of all, arguably, is an absence of collective imagination. It is as if humanity has been afflicted by a psychological complex, in which we believe the present world is stronger than our capacity to remake it \\u2014 as if it were not our ancestors who created what stands before us now. As if the very essence of humanity, if there is such a thing, is not to constantly build new worlds.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If we can move beyond such a failure, we will be able to see something wonderful. The plummeting cost of information and advances in technology are providing the ground for a collective future of freedom and luxury for all. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Automation, robotics and machine learning will, as many august bodies, from the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ft.com/content/3cea8516-8963-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Bank of England</a> to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/white-house-robot-workers_n_56cdd89ce4b0928f5a6de955" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">White House</a>, have predicted, substantially shrink the work force, creating widespread technological unemployment. But that\\u2019s only a problem if you think work \\u2014 as a cashier, driver or construction worker \\u2014 is something to be cherished. For many, work is drudgery. And automation could set us free from it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gene editing and sequencing could revolutionize medical practice, moving it from reactive to predictive. Hereditary diseases could be eliminated, including Huntington\\u2019s disease, cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia, and cancer cured before it reaches Stage 1. Those technologies could allow us to keep pace with the health challenges presented by societal aging \\u2014 by 2020 there will be <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">more people over the age of 60</a> than under the age of 5 \\u2014 and even to surpass them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What\\u2019s more, renewable energy, which has been experiencing steep annual falls in cost for half a century, could meet global energy needs and make possible the vital shift away from fossil fuels. More speculatively, asteroid mining \\u2014 whose technical barriers are presently being surmounted \\u2014 could provide us with not only more energy than we can ever imagine but also more iron, gold, platinum and nickel. Resource scarcity would be a thing of the past.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The consequences are far-reaching and potentially transformative. For the crises that confront our world today \\u2014 technological unemployment, global poverty, societal aging, climate change, resource scarcity \\u2014 we can already glimpse the remedy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there\\u2019s a catch. It\\u2019s called capitalism. It has created the newly emerging abundance, but it is unable to <!-- -->share round<!-- --> the fruits of technological development. A system where things are produced only for profit, capitalism seeks to ration resources to ensure returns. Just like today\\u2019s, companies of the future will form monopolies and seek rents. The result will be imposed scarcity \\u2014 where there\\u2019s not enough food, health care or energy to go around.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So we have to go beyond capitalism. Many will find this suggestion unwholesome. To them, the claim that capitalism will or should end is like saying a triangle doesn\\u2019t have three sides or that the law of gravity no longer applies while an apple falls from a tree. But for a better world, where everyone has the means to a good life on a habitable planet, it is an imperative.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We can see the contours of something new, a society as distinct from our own as that of the 20th century from feudalism, or urban civilization from the life of the hunter-gatherer. It builds on technologies whose development has been accelerating for decades and that only now are set to undermine the key features of what we had previously taken for granted as the natural order of things.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To grasp it, however, will require a new politics. One where technological change serves people, not profit. Where the pursuit of tangible policies \\u2014 rapid decarbonization, full automation and socialized care \\u2014 are preferred to present fantasies. This politics, which is utopian in horizon and everyday in application, has a name: Fully Automated Luxury Communism.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sounds good, doesn\\u2019t it?</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Aaron Bastani (<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/AaronBastani" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">@AaronBastani</a>) is a co-founder of Novara Media and the author of the forthcoming \\u201cFully Automated Luxury Communism: A Manifesto,\\u201d from which this essay is adapted. </p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
