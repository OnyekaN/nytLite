{'title': 'Acting Border Chief Expected to Resign as Migrant Children Are Returned to Texas Facility', 'author': 'By Caitlin Dickerson and Zolan Kanno-Youngs', 'link': '/2019/06/25/us/migrant-children-border.html'}[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Customs and Border Protection agency’s acting commissioner, John Sanders, is expected to step down in the coming weeks as the government’s primary border enforcement executive, a federal official said Tuesday, a development that comes as the agency faces continuing public fury over the treatment of detained migrant children.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The news of the resignation came shortly after agency officials disclosed that more than 100 children have been returned to a troubled Border Patrol station in Clint, Tex., a location where a group of lawyers who visited recently said hundreds of minor detainees had been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/migrant-children-border-soap.html?module=inline" title="">housed for weeks</a> without access to showers, clean clothing, or sufficient food.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Sanders has led the agency since President Trump tapped the former Customs and Border Protection commissioner, Kevin McAleenan, to replace Kirstjen Nielsen as homeland security secretary. Mr. Sanders specialized in developing technology for national security initiatives and previously served as the chief technology officer for the Transportation Security Administration.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The official who confirmed his resignation, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter, said it was not clear whether the impending resignation was connected to recent criticism over the agency’s management of a large influx of migrant families along the border.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a call with reporters on Tuesday, a Customs and Border Protection official disputed the lawyers’ accounts of conditions for hundreds of migrant children at the facility in Clint, saying that detainees who are housed by the agency are given periodic access to showers, and are offered unlimited snacks throughout the day.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That assertion ran contrary to what the lawyers, from some of the nation’s top law schools, said they were told by children. During a court-ordered visit to the facility earlier this month, some children said they had not been allowed to shower in nearly a month, and were so hungry that it had been hard for them to sleep through the night.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/migrant-children-border-soap.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Read about the conditions migrant children were held in at Clint.</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I personally don’t believe these allegations,” the Customs and Border Protection official, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, told reporters.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The lawyers’ accounts prompted a significant public backlash, after which all but 30 of the roughly 300 children who were being housed in Clint were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/us/border-migrant-children-detention-soap.html?module=inline" title="">transferred elsewhere</a>. Some 249 were placed in a shelter network for children run by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement, while others were moved to a tent facility in El Paso run by Customs and Border Protection.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The C.B.P. official said changes put into place by the agency had alleviated overcrowding in Clint, and allowed the return of more than 100 children there. The spokesman said that no additional resources had been provided to the children who were returned to Clint.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">This story will be updated.</em></p>]
