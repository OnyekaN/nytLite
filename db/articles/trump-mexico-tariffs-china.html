On Monday, he pivoted back to his trade fight with China and vowed to hit Beijing with more <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">tariffs</a> if it did not accede to America\\u2019s trade demands.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe China deal\\u2019s going to work out,\\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview on CNBC. \\u201cYou know why? Because of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">tariffs.</a> Because right now China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own, because they don\\u2019t want to pay the tariffs.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/china-trade-donald-trump.html?module=inline" title="">long favored tariffs</a> as an immediate and unilateral policy tool. But his increasing confidence that the levies have helped accomplish his goals without harming the United States sets up an even more tumultuous period ahead for businesses, consumers and foreign countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cProtectionism shows no signs of abating, rather it is intensifying,\\u201d said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR Inc.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Markets are already counting on the Federal Reserve to come to the rescue by cutting interest rates. Fed officials <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/business/economy/powell-fed-trade-wars.html?module=inline" title="">have begun signaling</a> they are prepared to help prop up the economy to counter any slowdown from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">Mr. Trump\\u2019s trade war</a>, a development that could give the president even more leeway to carry out an aggressive trade policy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump on Monday continued to attack the Fed for raising rates last year, saying it had put the United States at a competitive disadvantage to China, which has a fairly subservient central bank. \\u201cThey devalue their currency. They have for years,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s put them at a tremendous competitive advantage, and we don\\u2019t have that advantage because we have a Fed that doesn\\u2019t lower interest rates.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president insisted his tariffs were having their intended effect \\u2014 pressuring other countries to make deals, prompting companies to move factories back to the United States and generating an enormous amount of money, all without costing American consumers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cA lot of countries have changed their habits because they know they\\u2019re next,\\u201d Mr. Trump said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said he was prepared to place 25 percent <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">tariffs</a> on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods and would do so immediately if a planned meeting with President Xi Jinping of China did not happen this month during the G-20 summit meeting in Japan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWe are scheduled to talk and meet,\\u201d Mr. Trump said during remarks to reporters at the White House. \\u201cWe always have the option to raise it another $300 billion to 25 percent.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump has blamed China for \\u201creneging\\u201d on a trade deal with the United States, and last month, he raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods as punishment. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/business/trump-trade-china.html?module=inline" title="">China has retaliated</a> by raising tariffs on about $60 billion worth of American products, like soybeans. Mr. Trump said on Monday that he saw no downside to taxing nearly everything China sends into the United States, saying it would continue to boost the American economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWe\\u2019ve never gotten 10 cents from China. Now we\\u2019re getting a lot of money from China, and I think that\\u2019s one of the reasons the G.D.P. was so high in the first quarter because of the tariffs that we\\u2019re taking in from China,\\u201d he said, referring to the gross domestic product, which grew about 3.1 percent in the first three months of the year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economists and business leaders <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/business/tariffs-trump-mexico-china.html?module=inline" title="">have rejected</a> Mr. Trump\\u2019s claims that the tariffs are doing no harm and say the trade war is slowing global growth and could ultimately trigger a recession.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Bank <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/549841559120768022/Trade-Amid-Tensions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said late last month</a> that global trade growth has slowed to its lowest level in a decade, while the International Monetary Fund warned that reciprocal tariffs between the United States and China could reduce global gross domestic product by 0.5 percent, or $455 billion, next year. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that at their current levels, Mr. Trump\\u2019s tariffs would cost the typical American household $831 over a year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the president and his top advisers continue to disagree that import taxes \\u2014 both real and threatened \\u2014 are pinching economic growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI don\\u2019t think in any way that the slowdowns you\\u2019re seeing in parts of the world are a result of trade tensions at the moment,\\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/us/politics/g20-us-china-trade-war.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Falan-rappeport&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">told reporters this weekend on the sidelines of the G-20</a> meeting in Japan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That view is unlikely to change absent a steep drop in the stock market or a pronounced slowdown in the American economy, two metrics that Mr. Trump pays close attention to.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/business/wall-street-federal-reserve-interest-rates.html?module=inline" title="">expect the Fed to act</a> before that occurs. Markets now estimate an 80 percent chance of a rate cut at or before the Fed\\u2019s July meeting, and they see a 46 percent chance of three or more .25 percentage point cuts by the end of the year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those estimates fell, but not by much, after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/politics/trump-tariffs-mexico.html?module=inline" title="">Mr. Trump announced on Friday</a> that he had reached an immigration deal with Mexico and would suspend his tariffs, suggesting investors are accepting a rate cut as a done deal. Analysts say that the president\\u2019s willingness to use levies as a negotiating tactic for nontrade matters is helping to perpetuate uncertainty.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, Mr. Trump defended the immigration agreement with Mexico as a victory, and said unequivocally that tariffs were the vehicle that delivered it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cIf we didn\\u2019t have tariffs, we wouldn\\u2019t have made a deal with Mexico,\\u201d the president said. \\u201cWe got everything we wanted.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was not clear what the threat of tariffs on Mexico helped the president to secure. Major terms of the deal were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html?module=inline" title="">agreed to months ago</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But last week, Mexico said it would deploy its national guard around the country, including to its southern border, and expand a program to allow asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their legal cases proceed, both actions that had been discussed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html?module=inline" title="">in prior months</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States and Mexico also reached an agreement in principle to review the number of migrants crossing into the United States in 45 days and again in 90 days. If the number has not dropped sufficiently, Mr. Trump said he could impose tariffs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some said Mr. Trump\\u2019s threats toward Mexico, a close American ally, could send a message that trade wars are winnable and that the president will not back down against China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cIt\\u2019s obvious that on a long-term perspective, President Trump is willing to effectively weaponize tariffs,\\u201d said Wen Lu, a rates strategist at TD Securities. \\u201cI think he\\u2019s almost using this as a political message to reinforce his stance against China.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president\\u2019s fondness for levies has already propelled the United States into the top echelons of tariff-wielding countries. The United States now has an overall tariff level that is more than twice as high as Canada, Britain, Italy and Germany, and even higher than emerging markets like Russia and Turkey, according to research by Torsten Slok, a chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Progress toward a trade agreement with China has stalled since early last month, and Mr. Mnuchin said over the weekend that no further talks were scheduled. The next significant meeting is expected to take place between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi in late June.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the meantime, the United States continues to prepare for the next round of Chinese tariffs. The United States trade representative will hold a hearing on June 17 to allow companies to testify about the effects of the next $300 billion worth of levies on their businesses. That round of tariffs would hit a wide range of consumer goods, including sneakers, televisions and cribs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump has also indicated he sees the fate of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that has been blacklisted from buying American technology, as a point of leverage in the trade talks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The administration <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html?module=inline" title="">announced a ban</a> on Huawei\\u2019s access to American components on May 15, citing security concerns. The executive order blacklisting Huawei had actually been prepared for months, but officials held off issuing it while trade talks continued. When negotiations with the Chinese broke down at the beginning of May, a consensus emerged among top Trump administration officials to proceed with adding the company to an \\u201centity list,\\u201d according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named to discuss private deliberations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, Mr. Trump said he viewed Huawei as a \\u201cthreat\\u201d but \\u201cat the same time, it could be very well that we do something with respect to Huawei as part of our trade negotiations with China.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other countries are watching the threats warily. The Trump administration gave the European Union and Japan <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/us/politics/china-auto-tariffs-donald-trump.html?module=inline" title="">a six-month reprieve</a> from tariffs on their auto exports in May, but negotiators have yet to make much progress on a trade agreement.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The administration has also been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/business/trump-india-trade.html?module=inline" title="">ramping up a trade fight with India</a>, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/trump-currency-manipulators.html?module=inline" title="">laying the groundwork</a> to impose tariffs on a variety of countries for manipulating their currencies.</p>]]', 'link': '/2019/06/10/us/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs-china.html#commentsContainer', 'title': '<title data-rh="true">Trump Says Mexico Tariffs Worked, Emboldening Trade Fight With China - The New York Times</title>'}
