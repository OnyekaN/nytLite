{'body': '[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In spring 2018, Abby Wambach, the most decorated soccer player in American history, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJe40l2waxs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">gave a commencement address</a> at Barnard College that went viral. The player who had scored more goals than any other, male or female, in international competition described standing onstage at the ESPYs the year after she retired in 2015, receiving the Icon Award alongside two peers, Peyton Manning and Kobe Bryant. \\u201cI felt so grateful,\\u201d she recalled. \\u201cI had a momentary feeling of having arrived; like, we women had finally made it.\\u201d As the athletes exited the stage, each having, as Wambach put it, \\u201cleft it all on the field for decades with the same ferocity, talent and commitment,\\u201d it occurred to her that while the sacrifices the men made for their careers were nearly identical to her own, their new lives would not resemble hers in one fundamental way. \\u201cKobe and Peyton walked away from their careers with something I didn\\u2019t have: enormous bank accounts,\\u201d Wambach said. \\u201cBecause of that, they had something else I didn\\u2019t have: freedom. Their hustling days were over; mine were just beginning.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States women\\u2019s national team is the best in the world and has been for decades. Since the FIFA Women\\u2019s World Cup was inaugurated in 1991, the United States has won three of the seven titles, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/sports/soccer/womens-world-cup-usa-defeats-japan-to-win-title.html?searchResultPosition=4&amp;module=inline" title="">including the most recent one in 2015</a>. Since women\\u2019s soccer became an Olympic sport in 1996, it has won four of six gold medals. The team has been ranked No.1 by FIFA for 10 of the last 11 years and has produced some of the biggest female sports stars of the last several decades, from Mia Hamm to Wambach to the current starting center forward, Alex Morgan. The squad playing at the World Cup this month in France includes Morgan; her accomplice on the left wing, the Tilda Swinton doppelg\\xe4nger Megan Rapinoe; and the previous World Cup\\u2019s hat-trick-scoring hero, Carli Lloyd; along with newcomers like the elegant but deadly Mallory Pugh and the ingenious, bruising midfielder Lindsey Horan. The American team is favored to successfully defend its title, despite a field of opponents whose depth, fitness and all-around sophistication improved drastically even in the past four years, reflecting the rapid growth of women\\u2019s soccer globally. \\u201cThis is the first World Cup where I feel like \\u2014 and I\\u2019m rejoicing over this \\u2014 I can count potential World Cup winners on more than one hand,\\u201d the former player and current ESPN commentator Julie Foudy said when calling a recent match between the United States and Mexico.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was particularly important, then, in the months leading up to this moment, for the American women to keep their focus, minimize distractions and avoid drama at all costs. Which they did, with one enormous exception. On March 8, they <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline" title="">sued the United States Soccer Federation</a>, claiming \\u201cpurposeful gender discrimination.\\u201d \\u201cThe bottom line is simple,\\u201d the star defender Becky Sauerbrunn said in a statement. \\u201cIt is wrong for us to be paid and valued less for our work because of our gender.\\u201d Rapinoe, also in a statement, mentioned the responsibility the team feels to advocate \\u201con behalf of our teammates, future teammates, fellow women athletes and women all around the world.\\u201d This was 95 days before the team\\u2019s first World Cup match in France and mere weeks before the beginning of its next training camp \\u2014 a weeklong blend of intense practice and tryouts aimed at enabling Coach Jill Ellis and her staff to get the alchemy just right. But the players felt they could not wait. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t always want to be patient,\\u201d Morgan tells me. \\u201cYou have to seize the moment.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/magazine/why-is-us-womens-soccer-still-fighting-to-exist.html?module=inline"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/magazine/why-is-us-womens-soccer-still-fighting-to-exist.html" title="">[Why is U.S. women\\u2019s soccer still fighting to exist?]</a></a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The lawsuit\\u2019s timing may be dramatic, but it was the natural next step in a continuing dispute that centers on equal compensation. Members of the U.S.W.N.T. have been pursuing fair compensation for years, with only marginal improvement: The lawsuit asserts, for example, that from 2013 to 2016, if a male and a female national team player each played 20 exhibition games in a year, members of the men\\u2019s squad would have earned an average of $263,320, while members of the women\\u2019s squad would have earned a maximum of $99,000. The suit also claims that \\u201cduring the period relevant to this case,\\u201d the women\\u2019s team earned more for U.S. Soccer than the men\\u2019s team did. It cites numbers from the 2016 fiscal year that indicate that the federation had expected a combined net loss for the national teams of $429,929, but that largely because of the women\\u2019s team\\u2019s successes it revised its projections to a $17.7 million profit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a response filed on May 7, U.S. Soccer denies many of the specifics provided in the lawsuit, including those mentioned above, but it doesn\\u2019t dispute that the men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s players are not paid equally. Instead, it asserts that those inequities are a result of \\u201cdifferent pay structures for performing different work.\\u201d It characterizes as \\u201cmisleading and inaccurate\\u201d the claims that the women\\u2019s team generates more revenue than the men\\u2019s, while also framing the women\\u2019s and men\\u2019s teams as so different from each other that they can\\u2019t legitimately be compared at all. This is true in at least one sense: The women are way, way better. The men\\u2019s national team lost in the round of 16 at the 2014 World Cup and didn\\u2019t even qualify for the 2018 World Cup. American men haven\\u2019t won an Olympic medal in more than a century. Partly as a consequence of their superior results, from 2015 to 2018, the women\\u2019s team played 19 more matches than the men. In other words, the women aren\\u2019t working as hard as their male counterparts for less money; they\\u2019re working <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">harder</em> for less money. For the record, the men\\u2019s team\\u2019s players association released a statement of full-throated support for their women\\u2019s team compatriots and the mutual goal of equal pay.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In her Barnard speech, Wambach said she regretted being so caught up in gratitude for what she and her peers did receive that she \\u201cmissed opportunities to demand equality for all of us.\\u201d Her former teammates do not intend to make that same mistake. They are better paid than any women\\u2019s sports team in history, and at least as well known, but it\\u2019s not enough. Not only because by the players\\u2019 calculations they are making as little as 38 cents to their male counterparts\\u2019 dollar, but because these players feel a responsibility to fight, in public, on the biggest stage possible, while they can. \\u201cIt\\u2019s wonderful to be a professional athlete and feel fulfilled, but at the same time, what sort of legacy do you want to leave?\\u201d Morgan wonders. \\u201cI had this dream of being a professional soccer player, and I never knew it entailed being a role model, being an inspiration, standing up for things I believe in, standing up for gender equality. But now I don\\u2019t know a world where I just play soccer. It goes hand in hand.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">On a glittering April</strong> evening in Los Angeles, 20,941 fans crowded into the Banc of California Stadium, home to Major League Soccer\\u2019s Los Angeles F.C., to watch the American women trounce the 20th-ranked Belgians, 6-0, in a match of no real consequence. (This was one of several exhibition matches, known as \\u201cfriendlies,\\u201d the women\\u2019s team played before leaving for France.) Three teenage girls gathered on the south end of the stadium near the Belgian goal. Two wanted to head up to the mezzanine to see if they could get a glimpse of the Hollywood celebrities in the house \\u2014 Natalie Portman, Jessica Chastain, Jennifer Garner, Eva Longoria and Uzo Aduba were all in the V.I.P. box, hanging out with Megan Rapinoe, who was not playing because of a mild injury. But one of the teenagers, a tall brunette in jean shorts and a cropped T-shirt, wasn\\u2019t ready to go actress hunting yet. She stood staring at the action on the pitch, mesmerized. \\u201cLet me just see this last play,\\u201d she pleaded \\u2014 and right then, Carli Lloyd cut back behind her defender and threaded a perfect pass to Alex Morgan, who chipped it into the back of the net.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The official Time\\u2019s Up Instagram account later posted a photo of the actresses, all Time\\u2019s Up supporters, in their U.S.W.N.T. jerseys, with the caption \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for U.S. Soccer Federation to pay their women players what they deserve.\\u201d That Time\\u2019s Up is choosing to formally align itself, and its quest for equal pay in Hollywood, with the women\\u2019s national team is particularly gratifying for the players. They consider their fight to be in keeping with the larger social-justice stories of this era, from the rise of explicitly feminist movements like Time\\u2019s Up and #MeToo to Black Lives Matter and L.G.B.T. advocacy. \\u201cIt\\u2019s one and the same,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cI get asked this question a lot, like, \\u2018Where does this come from?\\u2019 or \\u2018Why do you stand up for these things?\\u2019 To me, it\\u2019s literally all the same, insofar as I want people to respect who I am, what I am \\u2014 being gay, being a woman, being a professional athlete, whatever. That is the exact same thing as what Colin did.\\u201d Rapinoe began kneeling during the national anthem in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick in September 2016; in March 2017, U.S. Soccer instituted a policy requiring players to \\u201cstand respectfully.\\u201d (Rapinoe now stands but does not place her hand over her heart.) \\u201cWho do you want to be?\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cWhat kind of person do you want to be for yourself, but also in the larger context of the country and in the world?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Serena Williams, asked by reporters to comment on the women\\u2019s soccer team\\u2019s lawsuit after a second-round victory at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., called the pay discrepancy \\u201cludicrous,\\u201d adding, \\u201cI think at some point, in every sport, you have to have those pioneers, and maybe it\\u2019s the time for soccer.\\u201d Indeed, American women\\u2019s soccer has its original class of pioneers: the so-called 99ers, members of the 1999 World Cup-winning team. At the Los Angeles friendly, Jennifer Garner wore one of their names \\u2014 Mia Hamm \\u2014 on her jersey, Aduba wore the legendary goalkeeper Briana Scurry\\u2019s number and Jessica Chastain wore the jersey of a player with whom she happens to share a surname: Brandi Chastain. It was Brandi Chastain who became a kind of aesthetic allegory for the spirit of the national team when, after sinking the winning penalty against China in the 1999 final, she whipped off her jersey in celebration. The image of Chastain in her sports bra, six-pack on display, triumph on her face, is one of the most famous in the history of sports, both because it captured a huge moment in soccer and because it launched a backlash against Chastain, who was accused of being disrespectful by critics who appeared to believe it was cool for male players to celebrate in this way but uncouth for women to do the same.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/sports/womens-world-cup-jamaica.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Read about the Women\\u2019s World Cup\\u2019s other inequality: rich vs. poor.]</em></a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many of the 99ers were in attendance at the friendly to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their World Cup victory. It was that win that established the Americans as women\\u2019s soccer\\u2019s first true global stars, the first group of players with the clout to move the needle on issues big (better pay) and small (getting uniforms in women\\u2019s sizes). Before that World Cup, which was held for the first time in the United States, the team was accustomed to playing to crowds of 5,000, but the 1999 World Cup final at the Rose Bowl drew 90,185 people, still the record for a women\\u2019s sporting event. After they won, the players toured the country like rock stars, visiting the White House, Disneyland and \\u201cThe Late Show,\\u201d where David Letterman referred to them as \\u201cbabe city.\\u201d When the dust settled, however, America\\u2019s newest sweethearts discovered that they were out of work. There was still no viable professional league in the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The 99ers were determined to use the leverage gained by their victory to start a fully professional league, the W.U.S.A. But by the time the national team (including a young Abby Wambach) was defending its title four years later, the league had already folded. And so it went for the next decade. The women\\u2019s national team continued to be among the most elite in the world, but it returned home after major victories (Olympic gold in 2004, 2008, 2012) to a succession of professional leagues that never stabilized, all the while clawing out incremental financial advances in a series of collective-bargaining agreements with U.S. Soccer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The National Women\\u2019s Soccer League, now in its seventh season, is the longest-running professional women\\u2019s soccer league ever in the United States, but its players still do not make a living wage: The minimum salary was just bumped up to $16,538. Major League Soccer pays male players a minimum salary in the $50,000-a-year range.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The women\\u2019s national team\\u2019s lawsuit will play out in a Los Angeles courtroom on a date yet to be set by the Federal District Court, where U.S. Soccer will need to show that the pay disparities between their two teams exist for some reason, any reason, other than sex. According to the women\\u2019s lawsuit, U.S. Soccer has said it can\\u2019t grant economic parity because \\u201cmarket realities are such that the women do not deserve to be paid equally to the men.\\u201d Then there\\u2019s the \\u201cBut you agreed to be paid less\\u201d argument, which appears to be central to U.S. Soccer\\u2019s strategy: In April 2017, the women\\u2019s national team and U.S. Soccer signed a new collective-bargaining agreement in which the women gained ground but did not receive the equal pay they were hoping for. \\u201cIt was the best deal we could get at the time,\\u201d Rapinoe says.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The previous agreement had been in place since 2013. As the 2016 Olympics loomed, the female players were reportedly considering striking \\u2014 hoping to leverage their position as defending gold medalists to increase their shot at earning equal compensation in their next collective-bargaining agreement \\u2014 when U.S. Soccer sued to prevent them from doing so and won.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shortly before that ruling came down, five members of the team \\u2014 Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Becky Sauerbrunn, Alex Morgan and Hope Solo, the goalkeeper at the time \\u2014 filed a federal discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is required before you can sue. This February, when the team was between training camps, the five original players named in the 2016 complaint finally received a response in the form of \\u201cright to sue\\u201d letters, meaning that no determination had been reached one way or another and that they had 90 days to file suit in federal court. So they did.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The 2019 Women\\u2019s World Cup is expected to be the most watched in history. In the United States, these matches will most likely be among the highest-rated soccer games ever played. (The 2015 final in Canada, between the United States and Japan, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/sports/soccer/womens-world-cup-final-was-most-watched-soccer-game-in-united-states-history.html?searchResultPosition=6&amp;module=inline" title="">averaged 23 million English-language viewers</a> in the States, six million more than the 2014 Men\\u2019s World Cup final.) Yes, the Americans are favored, but they have never won Women\\u2019s World Cup titles back to back, and the United States has lately shown some vulnerability. The last major tournament it won was the 2015 World Cup. In 2017, it failed to perform as well as expected in two invitational events hosted on home soil, coming in last in the SheBelieves Cup and finishing second to Australia in the Tournament of Nations. At that point, several senior players, in what Sports Illustrated called a \\u201cplayer revolt,\\u201d initiated conversations with U.S. Soccer about replacing Coach Jill Ellis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This unrest came in the wake of the most psychologically gutting performance in team history, at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil. For the first time ever, the team failed to make the Olympic gold medal match; they lost on penalty kicks to Sweden in the quarterfinals. To say the humiliation of this defeat still stings is to put it mildly. \\u201cA lot of the players on this team that have never been to a World Cup did go to the Olympics and were a part of the team that didn\\u2019t perform as well as we should have and had the worst exit that we\\u2019ve ever had in the Olympics, and we never want to replicate that ever in this program, but especially this World Cup,\\u201d Alex Morgan told me in an unusually breathless burst. \\u201cThat\\u2019s definitely in the back of my mind.\\u201d At the end of 2017, U.S. Soccer made it clear that Ellis was staying, and by 2018 things had stabilized a bit; the team went undefeated last year. But in their first match of 2019, they lost 3-1 to France, a rising power that will no doubt be emboldened this summer, playing on its home turf.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In filing suit when they did, the players set themselves up for a very tense few months \\u2014 in part because they believe that their performance on the pitch holds the key to their progress off it. \\u201cAlways and forever, how well the team does on the biggest stage is probably the most important thing,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I stress to these kids,\\u201d she continues, referring to the younger players like Pugh and Horan, who walked into the national team\\u2019s world believing that their job was merely to play the best soccer of their lives and are now learning that\\u2019s only part of it. \\u201cEverything is more and better,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cI want them to understand that it\\u2019s better because we earned it; but it\\u2019s also better because we won. The most important thing is continuing to win.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">In the lobby</strong> of a boutique hotel in downtown Santa Barbara, where the national team stayed during its World Cup training camp in March, well-heeled tourists poured cucumber water from glass vats and discussed where to lunch. The whole place smelled like expensive candles. \\u201cNo more Marriott Residence Inn for us,\\u201d Rapinoe said with a grin after settling into an overstuffed love seat next to a stunning bouquet of flowers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About an hour earlier, the 28 athletes who were in contention for the World Cup team (23 would make the cut) finished practice. As some traipsed through the lobby, sweaty and joking with one another, a few sang the chorus to Lil Nas X\\u2019s \\u201cOld Town Road\\u201d (\\u201cCan\\u2019t nobody tell me nothin\\u2019/You can\\u2019t tell me nothin\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d), which had been a fixture in camp. Soon they would shower and have group lunch. The day before, the players also had morning training followed by lunch, then a meeting with the team\\u2019s sports psychologist before group dinner. After training, there are ice baths and other recovery work. This is how the players\\u2019 lives are programmed: Eat, train, recover, eat, sleep, repeat. \\u201cSoccer is like \\u2018Groundhog Day,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s great, it\\u2019s fine, but it\\u2019s not that exciting all the time.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWe know the sacrifices we make; it\\u2019s no different than what men make,\\u201d Carli Lloyd says. \\u201cWe\\u2019re away from our families. We\\u2019re away from our friends. We\\u2019re spending every waking hour dedicating ourselves to this.\\u201d If an international squad is a collection of roles filled by a rotating cast of actual human beings, Lloyd is currently in the \\u201cseasoned veteran in the twilight of her career\\u201d spot, the one Wambach was in during the last World Cup. A two-time FIFA player of the year, Lloyd scored a hat trick in the first 16 minutes of the 2015 final against Japan, topping off an already remarkable run of play. Lloyd is 36 now. She feels as sharp as ever, she says, and has been playing largely as a second-half substitute in these recent friendlies, scoring thrilling clutch goals. But she is not likely to get a ton of playing time in France, and even if she does, this is almost certainly her last World Cup.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When I joked about how it would be amusing to try to train with her, she snickered and told me about one reporter who tried that and tore her A.C.L. \\u2014 \\u201cYou could hear the pop\\u201d \\u2014 and another who broke her wrist trying to block a Lloyd shot. But Lloyd turned wistful when she shared that she and her husband are planning to start a family in the next few years, but in looking at their bank account she realized: \\u201cI can\\u2019t just say, \\u2018O.K., this is my last game, and I\\u2019ve made tens of millions of dollars and it\\u2019s stashed away and we\\u2019re good.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d For the moment, Lloyd has no interest in retiring. She remains committed to the lawsuit \\u2014 though she acknowledges she \\u201cmay be done playing by the time this gets resolved\\u201d \\u2014 and to winning in France. She also deeply enjoys the rigorous two-a-day training sessions she does when home in New Jersey. This is all part of what Lloyd calls her eternal addiction to \\u201cchasing something I need to improve on.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They all talk like this, about a state of permanent dissatisfaction and a pleasure taken in pursuing the very perfection they know is unattainable. The one thing every of them has is this superhuman drive. \\u201cPlayers come in all the time, great players, sometimes more talented players,\\u201d says the forward Christen Press, the squad\\u2019s resident \\u201cWhat does it all mean?\\u201d existential philosopher, who first played on the team in 2012. \\u201cThe players that survive here are the most competitive ones. No one on this team has been here for more than two years and not felt like they had their face planted on the ground. Many just don\\u2019t get up. The people that last here get up.\\u201d She continues: \\u201cIt\\u2019s such a small, elite group that you\\u2019re filtered out if you don\\u2019t have that.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If Lloyd represents one role in the life cycle of a national team player, Lindsey Horan represents its opposite: the young-gun rising star and one of the picks to emerge from this World Cup a newly minted superstar. Her path is itself a testament to the progress that has been made in opportunities for American women who love to play soccer. When Lloyd made her debut on the team in 2005, there was <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">still</em> no viable professional league in the United States. Lloyd played all four years at Rutgers, then came to the national team \\u201cright when they were negotiating stable salaries and contracts,\\u201d she remembers. Horan, on the other hand, went straight to the pros from high school. This is a controversial move. Press calls it \\u201ccrazy\\u201d for most players, laughing and shaking her head. \\u201cThe league is not stable enough,\\u201d she explains. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re playing in the N.B.A., you can make two years of your salary and pay for your college anytime you want to go back. But that\\u2019s not the case with the N.W.S.L.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Advisable or not, by 2012, when Horan got on the plane to France to begin her time at Paris Saint-Germain, professional women\\u2019s leagues were prominent enough, in the States and in Europe, that such a move was possible. It was her dream, so she went for it. Horan is not much for keeping her cards close to her chest. Getting called up, training, playing well in international tournaments, then focusing on showing her best game in camp these last months has been enough of a challenge, she says, without the added pressure to become a civil rights activist overnight. \\u201cIt has been very hard,\\u201d Horan says. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always just been like: Oh, I love soccer. I love being here. I\\u2019m so happy to be a part of this team.\\u201d But lately, that has shifted. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always wanted to just stay out of that and focus on the game, but now I think that is almost selfish, because we do have a voice, and so many people watch us, and we\\u2019re their inspirations, and we\\u2019re their idols, and us speaking up is huge.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The \\u201cfour or five girls that are very vocal\\u201d who Horan says helped her reach this conclusion \\u2014 the team leaders when it comes to advocacy \\u2014 have a knack for instilling a sense of social responsibility in others. \\u201cWe try, first of all, education,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cWe break down the inequities. We tell them: This is why we are choosing to take this stance, for these reasons. We try to show specifically how it affects each individual player, but then also the team as a whole.\\u201d Could someone have declined to join the lawsuit if she wanted to? \\u201cYeah,\\u201d says Rapinoe, slowly. \\u201cIt\\u2019s always possible, and we had some players that took longer.\\u201d But, she says, \\u201cIf you want the door open, you have to open it.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">On a welcome</strong> bright April day after a very wet stretch in Denver, 10-year-old Lilli and her 9-year-old friend, Reese, sat in their soccer kits, legs dangling off white folding chairs, in front of City Hall. This was a school day, but Reese\\u2019s mother brought them to watch two of their heroes, Lindsey Horan and Mallory Pugh, receive an honorary street sign and a \\u201cchallenge coin,\\u201d the equivalent of a key to the city. Pugh and Horan are both Denver-area natives, and both came up through the hypercompetitive ranks of Colorado youth soccer. They are models for what Lilli and Reese plan to become when they grow up: pro soccer players. \\u201cIt\\u2019s educational!\\u201d Lilli insisted of this field trip for two. Then she showed off the ball, shoes, shin guards and backpack she had brought to have signed. By which player? \\u201cBoth of them!\\u201d Lilli plays offense, and this kind of game-day aggressiveness will come in handy for her on the field, for sure, but it may be even more important off the field if she\\u2019s serious about a career in professional soccer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Watching Horan and Pugh stand only somewhat awkwardly next to the mayor, with their parents snapping pictures and a local news crew on hand to document the quaint pageantry, felt like watching the opening scene in a biopic. Each is already a groundbreaker: Pugh is the youngest American player, at 17, ever to play in an Olympic-qualifying match, and Horan is the first American woman to go straight from high school to the pros. They now play for top teams in the N.W.S.L. \\u2014 Pugh for the Washington Spirit, Horan for the Portland Thorns \\u2014 and they have high-profile endorsement deals (Pugh with Nike, Horan with Adidas). Pugh and Horan didn\\u2019t know this yet, but they would each make the World Cup squad \\u2014 another milestone reached. But the question remains: Will one or both of these players break the record so many of her predecessors could not and become the first in women\\u2019s soccer history to retire without having to worry about her next paycheck? And if not Pugh or Horan, how about by the time we get to Lilli or Reese?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The 28 women suing U.S. Soccer have, in some cases, very little in common other than their sport. Avowed Christians and atheists, gay and straight, politically active and not, they have nonetheless rallied behind this collective cause. \\u201cYou really do need everyone,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a crazy intimate environment. We\\u2019re not all really, really close, but we\\u2019re extremely intimate.\\u201d At the hotel in Santa Barbara, she brought up the concept of \\u201cthe double earn,\\u201d a reference to the unpaid labor taken on by women, especially at home, that goes largely unacknowledged; Rapinoe was drawing a parallel between that work and the work that she and her teammates are having to do to secure equal rights that should already be theirs. The soccer players, differences aside, have something powerful in common besides competitive drive: They are, every one of them, from 20-year-old defender Tierna Davidson to 36-year-old Carli Lloyd, pulling a double shift. \\u201cWe really don\\u2019t want to be doing all of this all of the time,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cWe\\u2019d much prefer to not be engaging in litigations. We\\u2019d much prefer not to have to be the nag in the room. We\\u2019d prefer to be thought partners and business partners.\\u201d Rapinoe sat up a little straighter in her seat. \\u201cBut obviously that\\u2019s not the case.\\u201d</p>]]', 'link': '/2019/06/10/magazine/womens-soccer-inequality-pay.html#commentsContainer', 'title': '<title data-rh="true">The Best Women\xe2\x80\x99s Soccer Team in the World Fights for Equal Pay - The New York Times</title>'}
