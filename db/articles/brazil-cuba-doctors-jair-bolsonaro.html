It impedes early diagnoses, the monitoring of children, pregnancies and the continuation of treatments that were already underway.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist, committed to making major changes to the Mais M\\xe9dicos program, an initiative begun in 2013 when a leftist government was in power. The program sent doctors into Brazil\\u2019s small towns, indigenous villages and violent, low-income urban neighborhoods.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About half of the Mais M\\xe9dicos doctors were from Cuba, and they were deployed to 34 remote indigenous villages and the poorer quarters of more than 4,000 towns and cities, places that established Brazilian physicians largely shun.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe willingness of Cuban doctors to work in difficult conditions became a cornerstone of the public health system,\\u201d said Ms. Bahia, the professor.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Brazil paid millions of dollars a month to Cuba for the doctors, making them <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/world/americas/venezuela-cuban-doctors.html?module=inline" title="">a vital export for the island\\u2019s coffers</a>. But most of the money went directly to Cuba\\u2019s Communist government, an arrangement Mr. Bolsonaro warned he would change.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cuban doctors <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/world/americas/brazil-cuban-doctors-revolt.html?module=inline" title="">have long complained about getting only a small cut</a> of the money for their work, and Mr. Bolsonaro said they would have to be allowed to keep their entire salaries and to bring their families with them to Brazil. They would also have to pass equivalency exams to prove their qualifications.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cOur Cuban brothers will be freed,\\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro said in an official campaign proposal presented to electoral authorities. \\u201cTheir families will be allowed to migrate to Brazil. And, if they pass the revalidation, they will begin to receive the entire amount that was being robbed by the Cuban dictators!\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two weeks after Mr. Bolsonaro <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election.html?module=inline" title="">won the presidency in October</a>, Cuba ordered all its doctors out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Access to free health care is a right under Brazilian law, and Mais M\\xe9dicos was enacted in 2013 by President Dilma Rousseff in a bid to provide medical care to communities that were not being served by the public health system. Through a network of free clinics, the program provided 60 million Brazilians with access to a family doctor in their community for the first time.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the first four years of Mais M\\xe9dicos, the percentage of Brazilians receiving primary care rose to 70 percent from 59.6 percent, according to<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.paho.org/bra/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5809:opas-lanca-relatorio-30-anos-de-sus-que-sus-para-2030-e-destaca-importancia-de-atencao-primaria-e-mais-medicos&amp;Itemid=843" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> a report</a> by the Pan-American Health Organization, which coordinated Cuba\\u2019s participation in the program.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The withdrawal of Cuban doctors could reverse that trend, with the consequences especially severe for those under 5, potentially leading to the deaths of up to 37,000 young children by 2030, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.terra.com.br/vida-e-estilo/saude/saida-de-cubanos-pode-levar-a-aumento-de-37-mil-mortes-diz-opas,c9da3a2fd30f623b7f4a90f607913279de24ust3.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">warned Dr. Gabriel Vivas</a>, an official with the Pan-American Health Organization.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In February, it looked as if Mr. Bolsonaro would fulfill his promise: the national Health Ministry announced that all of the positions left vacant by Cuba\\u2019s withdrawal had been filled with Brazilian doctors. But by April, thousands of the new recruits had either quit or failed to show up for work in the first place.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More than 2,000 Cuban doctors have chosen to remain in Brazil, defying the call to return home. But with the special arrangement with Cuba terminated, they are now ineligible to practice medicine until they pass an exam \\u2014 which the Brazilian government has not offered since 2017 and for which the Health Ministry has set no date.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Luiz Henrique Mandetta, Brazil\\u2019s health minister, said the new government was working on a bill to ensure the goals of Mais M\\xe9dicos were achieved and the doctors replaced.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cEven if the program has various problems, it has a positive side, which is, precisely, diminishing the inequality in health care neglect,\\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Mr. Mandetta initially said the bill would be sent to Congress between April and May. Now, the ministry says it will be introduced by the end of June.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Karel S\\xe1nchez was one of four Cuban doctors sent to the remote region of Cachoeira do Arari in the Brazilian Amazon. He waited there for five months after his government ordered the withdrawal of all Cuban doctors, with the expectation that Mr. Bolsonaro would respect his campaign pledge to provide an exam so he could continue to work and receive his full salary.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI was happy when Bolsonaro said he wouldn\\u2019t support a dictatorship,\\u201d Dr. S\\xe1nchez said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In April, Dr. S\\xe1nchez gave up and moved to S\\xe3o Paulo, where he scrapes together money by selling homemade sweets and working as a baggage handler at an airport.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cNow he doesn\\u2019t talk about us at all, just silence,\\u201d Dr. S\\xe1nchez said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Embu-Gua\\xe7u, Dr. Santa Cobas, the Cuban doctor who had been serving residents at the clinic now only open on Thursdays, was still nearby and eager to work.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Dr. Cobas is unemployed, and the 4,000 people she once cared for don\\u2019t have access to a local doctor six days a week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cNow we end up doing triage all day \\u2014 deciding who needs to rush to another hospital, who gets to see the visiting doctor on Thursday and who will just have to wait,\\u201d said Erica Toledo, the head nurse at the clinic, Jardim Campestre, which was opened in 2015.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cDr. Santa was here from the first day, and it was the first time people felt taken care of by their \\u2018own\\u2019 doctor,\\u201d Ms. Toledo said. \\u201cThey really love her.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The health secretary of Embu-Gua\\xe7u, Dr. Maria Dalva, said she was frustrated that 63 percent of the city had voted for Mr. Bolsonaro, despite his overt antipathy for Mais M\\xe9dicos.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe child mortality rate here dropped to 7 percent from 17 percent in five years thanks to Mais M\\xe9dicos,\\u201d said Dr. Dalva. \\u201cI told people to think about that before they voted.\\u201d</p>]]', 'link': '/2019/06/11/world/americas/brazil-cuba-doctors-jair-bolsonaro.html#commentsContainer', 'title': '<title data-rh="true">Brazil Fails to Replace Cuban Doctors, Hurting Health Care of 28 Million - The New York Times</title>'}
