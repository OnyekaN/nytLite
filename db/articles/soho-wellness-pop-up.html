{'body': '[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Within a half-mile radius in downtown Manhattan, there are five matcha stores: MatchaBar, Matchaful, Cha Cha Matcha, the other Cha Cha Matcha and Matcha n\\u2019 More, which are each less than five minutes apart on foot. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Matcha, a kind of powdered green tea used in Japanese tea ceremonies, has become a popular drink in the wellness scene for its grassy green color and antioxidants. High-end cafes in SoHo like Matchaful blend it with nut milks or spices and sell it for $7, more than the cost of a latte.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the same time, places that once catered to health-minded New Yorkers before wellness became a buzzword \\u2014 spots like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/dining/souen-nyc-closing.html?module=inline" title="">Souen</a>, Integral Yoga Natural Foods and Angelica Kitchen \\u2014 are closing. All three opened in the 1970s, when SoHo was home to an artistic and creative community.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the 1960s and \\u201970s, the neighborhood was a magnet for artists. Then came fancy shops and French restaurants. Most young artists haven\\u2019t been able to afford to live or maintain studios there for the last couple of decades.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Instead there is By Chloe, a vegan fast food restaurant, which sells a quinoa taco salad for $12.45; Brodo, which sells cups of bone broth for $10; the Good Market, which sells pineapple raspberry kombucha organic slushies for $4.50; Welleco and the Nue Co, both supplement stores; the Hemp Garden, where CBD sheet masks sell for $29.99; the Detox Market, where the Vintner\\u2019s Daughter Active Treatment Essence face oil is $225; Lululemon and Nike; boutique fitness establishments like Y-7 Studio, New York Pilates (three locations), SLT and SoulCycle, where classes are upward of $30.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In early April, Kind, the snack food company, organized a two-day pop-up highlighting its \\u201cSweeteners Uncovered\\u201d campaign, which shows hidden sugars in popular snack foods.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This took the form of a high-tech bodega at 579 Broadway, a space that once housed an Aldo shoe store and whose rent for the space Kind declined to share. At the pop-up, the sugar content from Kind\\u2019s competitors could be revealed by scanning a QR code. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of the few dozen people there bypassed the nutritional information to stuff free plastic fanny packs with free Kind Bars. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company hosted a pop-up in Times Square two years ago, but Jenna <!-- -->Keplesky<!-- -->, who works in Kind\\u2019s communications department, lobbied to move this one to SoHo. \\u201cI was encouraging locations that were more cost effective, but Jenna wanted the right brand message,\\u201d said Daniel Lubetzky, the chief executive of Kind. \\u201cI do think there\\u2019s a sense that SoHo is more representative and ahead of the curve in health and wellness in New York City.\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The neighborhood is also known to have a steady stream of foot traffic from New Yorkers and tourists alike, Ms. Keplesky said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In many cases, fanciful and high-concept pop-ups have followed wellness retailers to SoHo and its surrounding streets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Blume, which sells self-care and menstrual products marketed to young women and teenagers, had a pop-up at <!-- -->224 Mulberry Street<!-- --> in NoLIta in February that included a slumber party and panel discussion. The founders, Taran and Bunny Ghatrora, wrote in an email that they chose the location because it is one of their favorite neighborhoods and that a large portion of their New York community is based there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The condom company Sustain Natural hosted the Get on Top Pop-Up in April 2018 at 208 Bowery, with neon vulva art installations and tampon-filled bathtubs leading into a back event space called the womb. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Meika Hollender, its chief executive, said that foot traffic and a neighborhood affinity for wellness made her choose the Bowery: \\u201cThere are so many like-minded wellness studios and brands showcasing their products in this area that it felt like a natural opportunity to reach consumers in a fun and accessible way. I mean, who wouldn\\u2019t be curious walking past a vagina-themed pop-up.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buffy, which makes comforters out of recycled plastic bottles and eucalyptus plants, had a \\u201cphysical touch-point\\u201d called Soft-Space at 150 Wooster Street (where, last year, a penthouse sold for $32.6 million) during the 2018 holiday season. According to a news release for the company, inspiration came from Buckminster Fuller and the hippie modernist movement of the 1960s and \\u201970s.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Clean Market, a store on 54th Street and Second Avenue that sells natural beauty products and services like vitamin IV drips, has a pop-up in NoLIta at Project by Equinox on <!-- -->Mulberry Street<!-- -->. \\u201cWe want the downtown crowd to get to know us,\\u201d said the founder Lily Kunin one afternoon as she sent an associate on an errand a few blocks north to the Farmer\\u2019s Dog pop-up at Showfields at 11 Bond Street. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Currently Showfields has pop-ups decorated with potted plants and pink velveteen chairs from the Australian skin care brand Frank Body and Quip, a dental company that frequently advertises on podcasts. <!-- -->The<!-- --> cafe, called Coffee \\u2019n Clothes, sells miniature cupcakes and lattes emblazoned with the logos of fashion brands. (Showfields, which calls itself \\u201cthe Most Interesting Store in the World,\\u201d occupies a 1913 NoHo building that, before its purchase in 2015 by FRF Realty for $26 million, housed a 43-bed women\\u2019s shelter.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the fact that the <!-- -->store<!-- --> was virtually empty on a recent Monday afternoon, some tenants, who pay a flat fee for space, are pleased with early results. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWhat we\\u2019ve managed to do in sales in three weeks was greater in total than one of our retail partners who has 13 or 14 doors nationwide,\\u201d said Jasmina Aganovic, the founder of Mother Dirt, a skin care line in Boston that has a second-floor space at Showfields. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a sexy location in New York City, and we have a large concentration of customers in New York and Brooklyn in particular.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Large companies have used wellness businesses as destinations for their own events. OtterBox introduced its Otter &amp; Pop phone cases to press at Chillhouse, a cafe, nail salon and massage studio on the neighboring Lower East Side. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Landlords are enthusiastic about wellness-related tenants, according to Paul Wexler, the head of Wexler Healthcare Properties at the Corcoran Group. \\u201cLandlords are generally encouraged by it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a way to fill retail spaces, and an amenity to their buildings. There are spaces we\\u2019re marketing with that in mind.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some smaller wellness businesses are looking to spread brand awareness if they could only find the right space. Justine Monsul, the founder of Monfefo, a beverage company that makes organic pressed ginger and turmeric shots, has been looking for a pop-up storefront. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cTrying to find a place in New York is like winning the lottery,\\u201d she said on the phone during a trip to Israel. \\u201cI want to share my story and have more of a relationship to my customers. You don\\u2019t just want a store, you want an experience. You want some palo santo burning.\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Colette Dong, the co-founder and C.E.O. of the Ness, opened a pop-up trampoline workout studio in nearby TriBeCa in a location that was a Bikram yoga studio. The pop-up lease was \\u201ca way to get our feet wet without getting locked into a five- or 10-year lease term and test the demand for it,\\u201d Ms. Dong said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWill we even have studios in five years?\\u201d Ms. Dong said. \\u201cWill there be studios to do our online streaming workouts? Will we be working out with robots?\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Maybe best not to commit to anything too long-term.</p>]]', 'link': '/2019/06/10/style/self-care/soho-wellness-pop-up.html', 'title': '<title data-rh="true">Has SoHo Become One Big Wellness Pop-Up? - The New York Times</title>'}
