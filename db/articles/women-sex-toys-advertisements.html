{'title': 'Opinion | Vaginas Deserve Giant Ads, Too', 'author': 'By Jackie Rotman', 'link': '/2019/06/25/opinion/women-sex-toys-advertisements.html'}[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Anyone who takes the subway regularly in New York City knows that riders can’t escape the ads for erectile dysfunction drugs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are the Hims ads, which suggestively feature cactuses, both standing and slumping; there are the Roman ads, offering to deliver such drugs directly to men’s doorsteps. Given all of this, shouldn’t we expect to also walk by an equal number of ads hawking women’s sexual health and wellness products, featuring, say, a giant papaya? And yet, as we all know, such placards are few and far between.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last week, Dame Products, a sex toy company featuring products that cater to women, sued the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for violating Dame’s rights to free speech, due process and equal protection. Why? Because, despite the abundance of cactuses everywhere, the authority won’t allow Dame’s advertisements on the subway. Dame’s lawsuit speaks to critical obstacles for sexual equality in our business practices and culture today.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the past 18 months, I have interviewed more than 30 entrepreneurs in female and male sexual wellness, as well as venture capitalists who have invested in this field. I have researched and worked on investments in sex education and contraception technology companies. What I’ve learned is that while women’s sexual wellness represents a large and growing market, the companies trying to address it face barriers that businesses aimed at the sexual wellness of men, relatively speaking, do not.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Certainly, many women would benefit from more tools to help them improve their sexual health. Nearly three out of four women experience pain during intercourse at some point. Half of women 18 to 35 have trouble reaching orgasm with a partner. Many menopausal women are not supported even as their bodies’ natural changes affect their sex lives.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">No surprise, then, that more women than men report using sex toys, according to researchers at Indiana University School of Public Health. Researchers have found that across almost every measure of women’s sexual function — desire, arousal, lubrication, lack of pain, and orgasm — vibrator users have more positive experiences.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So why was a new sex toy for women banned last winter from exhibition at the Consumer Electronics Show, the world’s largest consumer technology trade show? And why did the show revoke a robotics award that it originally granted the product? (Several months later, following a public outcry, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48200118" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">it was re-awarded</a>.) The Consumer Technology Association<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">, </strong>which operates the show, initially called the toy “immoral” and “profane.” Yet it also dedicated an entire room to virtual reality pornography, and it has prominently featured sex robots <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">— </strong>all targeted at male users.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And why won’t the popular payment processor Stripe work with companies that make sex toys like vibrators? While Stripe concedes on its website that such bans are “outdated and overly moralizing,” it also states that its partners — financial institutions and payment networks — think these businesses pose a brand risk, and do not want to be associated with them. Many banks, credit card companies and the most popular payment processors have policies against working with sex toy companies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s not just sex toy companies that get the cold shoulder; it’s also sex education companies. Stripe has turned away the company <!-- -->For Goodness Sake,<!-- --> which operates a website, OMGyes, for education on women’s pleasure. While Stripe says on its website that it wanted to do business with the company, it also said its financial partners were not comfortable with the arrangement. O.school, another online sex education platform, which reaches a diverse population and has a majority female user base, was, according to its founder<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">, </strong>denied a bank account by two premier banks in Silicon Valley.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Melanie Cristol left a partner-track career in law to develop Lorals, single-use latex panties intended to help women feel safer and more comfortable during oral sex. A condom factory in the United States was thrilled to manufacture Lorals — until discovering it was for oral sex on women. The manufacturer then backed out, Ms. Cristol said, stating that it reviewed the matter with its shareholders and did not want to be involved with the product. A bank then told<!-- --> the company<!-- --> that it would not be precluded from applying for a loan — only to change its mind, deciding the business was too sexual. Another lending institution later denied the business a loan for the same reason.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Perhaps the area in which the male-female pleasure priority gap is most apparent to the average consumer is in advertising. Beyond the New York subway, the advertising double standards are true for online spaces like Facebook and Instagram. Facebook even rejects ads offering lubricants and telehealth consultations for women going through menopause. That’s because its rules say advertisements cannot promote “adult products or services” unless they focus on contraception or family planning. That is, they cannot discuss pleasure or sexual enhancement (so condom ads are allowed if they focus on preventing pregnancy, for example, but not if, say, they talk about innovative ribbing). </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Facebook has never satisfactorily explained why erectile dysfunction drugs do not fall into the pleasure or sexual enhancement categories. It’s unclear whether ads for “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1826515124316584" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ball hair manscaping</a>” are about pleasure or not, but they are allowed, while ads for Ohnut, a product that became available last year to help prevent painful sex for women, including those who have undergone cancer treatments or who suffer from medical conditions like endometriosis, are not.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today’s business policies reflect a broader cultural norm in which women’s sexual pleasure is devalued compared with men’s. But this shouldn’t be, not only because women’s sexual well-being is equally valid as men’s, but also because it could be equally, if not more, profitable. Sex toys alone are a $27 billion global industry, of which the vibrator market makes up $6.5 billion and is growing at 13 percent annually. This is multiple times larger than the erectile dysfunction market, projected by some to be <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/erectile-dysfunction-drugs-market-size-expected-to-reach-usd-263-billion-by-2025-2019-03-19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">$2.6</a> billion to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/erectile-dysfunction-drugs.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">$2.9 billion</a> in six or seven years, though estimates vary. The menopause treatment, endometriosis and lubricant markets are also worth some <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/brandfeatures/venture-capital/article?id=50159" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">$3.3 billion</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.biospace.com/article/endometriosis-treatment-market-to-grow-at-a-cagr-of-2-9-percent-by-2028/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">$2.5 billion</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.arizton.com/news/press-release/global-personal-lube-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">$1.4 billion</a>, respectively.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A generation ago, smart women found a way to achieve gains in women’s sexual health for which they had long fought. Prescription contraception was not largely covered by insurance for about 40 years — until Viagra was introduced in 1998 and quickly covered. Women’s groups then showed it was discriminatory to cover Viagra but not prescription contraception.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today, old erectile-dysfunction patents are expiring, enabling a new wave of innovation and E.D. start-ups. They’ve been accompanied by mass advertising, not the wink-and-nod advertisements of decades ago, but ads that are more explicit than ever. And so it’s time once again to point out double standards and demand improvements in women’s lives. I, for one, am fine with walking onto the subway and seeing giant penises depicted as cactuses; I would simply like to see some papayas alongside them.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Jackie Rotman is the founder and chief executive of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://intimacyjustice.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Center for Intimacy Justice</a>, the first advocacy nonprofit dedicated to equal business rules toward women’s sexual wellness companies.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
