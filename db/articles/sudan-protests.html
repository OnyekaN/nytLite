General Hamdan leads <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/14/man-who-terrorized-darfur-is-leading-sudans-supposed-transition-hemeti-rsf-janjaweed-bashir-khartoum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the Rapid Support Forces</a>, the paramilitary force created by rebranding the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.france24.com/en/20190605-sudan-military-protest-janjaweed-dagalo-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">janjaweed</a> militias that conducted the genocide in Darfur.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The crackdown came after weeks of negotiations between protest leaders and the military council reached an impasse.

A delegation traveled to Cairo to secure political and financial support from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which disapproved of Mr. al-Bashir\\u2019s ties to Islamists and his outreach to Turkey and Qatar. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates followed up by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://apnews.com/e30e894617cf4dfb9a811af2df22de93" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reaching out to General al-Burhan and General Hamdan</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the Transitional Military Council assumed power, the Saudis and the Emiratis made their influence soon felt: On April 21, they <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-protests/saudi-arabia-uae-to-send-3-billion-in-aid-to-sudan-idUSKCN1RX0DG" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">approved $3 billion</a> in aid to Sudan, <!-- -->in a bid to strengthen the council. <!-- -->Yet in the weeks after, protesters continued to increase the pressure, as the number at sit-in camps swelled even as tense negotiations continued.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In late May, General Hamdan met with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia and reaffirmed his <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thenational.ae/world/mena/sudan-s-military-leadership-pledges-to-back-saudi-arabia-against-iran-threats-1.866068" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">commitment</a> to a close alliance with the kingdom.

But Sudan\\u2019s uprising against Mr. al-Bashir is an uprising against political Islamists; the protest leaders who have been negotiating with the military council are not Islamists. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are instead driven by their own <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/05/saudi-arabia-sudan-uprising-omar-al-bashir" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">fear</a> that should a major Arab country transition to democracy, it would lead to upheavals at home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With Sudan\\u2019s Arab neighbors under Saudi and Emirati sway, with the United States doing little beyond expressing concern, it has fallen to Ethiopia\\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, to take the lead in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/06/07/world/africa/07reuters-sudan-politics.html?searchResultPosition=5&amp;module=inline" title="">mediation</a> between the military council and the opposition.
