{'title': 'Opinion | Self-Inflicted Medical Misery', 'author': 'By Paul Krugman', 'link': '/2019/06/24/opinion/republican-states-health-care.html'}[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the weekend The Washington Post published a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/the-clinic-of-last-resort/2019/06/22/2833c8a0-92cc-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a_story.html?utm_term=.9e3e9565fe68" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">heart-rending description</a> of a pop-up medical clinic in Cleveland, Tenn. — a temporary installation providing free care for two days on a first-come-first-served basis. Hundreds of people showed up many hours before the clinic opened, because rural America is suffering from a severe crisis of health care availability, with hospitals closing and doctors leaving.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since the focus of the report was on personal experience, not policy, it’s understandable that the article mentioned only in passing the fact that Tennessee is one of the 14 states that still <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">refuse</a> to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. So I’m not sure how many readers grasped the reality that America’s rural health care crisis is largely — not entirely, but largely — a direct result of political decisions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The simple fact is that the Republicans who run Tennessee and other “non-expansion” states have chosen to inflict misery on many of their constituents, rural residents in particular. And it’s not even about money: The federal government would have paid for Medicaid expansion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So if rural America is suffering, a large part of the explanation is gratuitous political cruelty. This cruelty has denied health insurance to millions who could have had it with a stroke of the pen. And rural hospitals are closing, rural doctors leaving, in large part because people can’t afford to pay for care.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/paul-krugman?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[For an even deeper look at what’s on Paul Krugman’s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]</em></a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To see what I mean, just compare Tennessee with its neighbor Kentucky. As recently as 2013, just before the Affordable Care Act went into full effect, the two states looked similar in terms of health care: In both states, about 20 percent of nonelderly adults lacked insurance. But unlike Tennessee, Kentucky did expand Medicaid, and it also did its best to make Obamacare work. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The result was a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/adults-19-64/?activeTab=graph&amp;currentTimeframe=0&amp;startTimeframe=7&amp;selectedDistributions=uninsured&amp;selectedRows=%7B%22states%22:%7B%22kentucky%22:%7B%7D,%22tennessee%22:%7B%7D%7D%7D&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">two-thirds drop</a> in the uninsurance rate. At the same time, progress in Tennessee was far more limited. At this point, adults in Tennessee are twice as likely as their neighbors to lack health insurance.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And the divergence in destinies was even greater for rural residents. According to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ccf.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/FINALHealthInsuranceCoverage_Rural_2018.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Georgetown University study</a> that covered a seven-year period spanning the introduction of the A.C.A., the percentage of low-income rural adults without health insurance fell 27 points in Kentucky, only six points in Tennessee.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Of course, if the U.S. were like every other wealthy nation, and provided some kind of universal health care, there would be no uninsured at all. Those heart-rending scenes in Cleveland would be inconceivable anywhere else in the advanced world. But the A.C.A. isn’t a future aspiration, it’s an already-existing program — and a lot of rural America’s medical misery could be avoided if states like Tennessee were willing to take advantage of that program.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And we’re not just talking about having insurance; we’re talking about whether there are doctors and hospitals available to provide care. True, rural hospitals have been closing in many states as the nonmetropolitan<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/population-migration/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> population</a> declines. But a project that tracks <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">rural hospital closings</a> since 2010 finds that a great majority have taken place in states that didn’t expand Medicaid. Four rural hospitals have closed in California, but 17 have closed in Texas. Tennessee has had three times as many closings as Kentucky.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The point is that much of the collapse of rural health care could have been avoided, and could be easily reversed, if so many state governments hadn’t chosen to impose misery on their own rural constituents.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> While rural Americans often tell reporters that they feel neglected and ignored by big-city coastal elites, the people preventing them from getting health care aren’t in New York or D.C., they’re in their own state capitals. And these state politicians hold power in large part thanks to the strong <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://wthh.dataforprogress.org/blog/the-urban-suburban-rural-divide-in-the-2018-midterms" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Republican leaning</a> of rural voters.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But why are Republican state-level politicians so determined to punish their own base? As I said, it’s not about the money: Rejecting the Medicaid expansion actually costs a state jobs and hence revenue.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of it may reflect the general meanspiritedness, the embrace of cruelty, that was already infecting the G.O.P. even before Donald Trump, and has now become one of the party’s defining traits. Yes, that’s harsh, but you know that it’s true.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There’s also, I suspect, an element of cynical calculation. As I said, rural voters often complain that national elites don’t care about their needs. Well, one way to make people feel hostile toward those elites is to block their access to federal benefits, and hope they don’t realize who’s actually causing their misery. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Is it conceivable that conservative politicians have that much contempt for their base? Yes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In any case, the point is that while rural decline in general is a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/opinion/rural-america-economic-decline.html?module=inline" title="">hard problem</a>, with no easy answers, rescuing rural health care isn’t hard at all. We know how to ensure that rural Americans get the health care they need. This isn’t a problem of policy, it’s a problem of politics — and most of the blame lies with Republican state governments.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
