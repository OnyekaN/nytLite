{'body': '[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">CINCINNATI \\u2014 Most of us can probably agree that eating food is more enjoyable than watching someone else eat food. For one, it\\u2019s a basic human need. It also tastes good a lot of the time. Not to mention, people can be pretty gross when they eat, especially when they do so in over-the-top, finger-licking fashion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, hundreds of thousands of people tune in each week to watch Bethany Gaskin binge-eat shellfish on YouTube.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mrs.<!-- --> Gaskin, 44, has capitalized on the popularity of a food-video genre known as mukbang, which involves scarfing down, on camera, more grub than should rightly be consumed in a single sitting. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On her two YouTube channels, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG_Nlvx1EoxkeZkuLjelWdA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Bloveslife</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqzQA4tjCh-uAOAHz8_qGpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">BlovesASMR Eating Her Way</a>, Mrs. Gaskin chats up her audience while eating king crab legs, mussels, lobster tails, hard-boiled eggs and roasted red potatoes. The videos, produced in her Cincinnati home, have made her a millionaire, she said. But getting into the business wasn\\u2019t about money; mukbang was more of a calling than a vocation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI think of mukbanging as a ministry,\\u201d Mrs. Gaskin said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t consult with my husband before I quit my job. I knew this was it, and I quit by faith.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mukbang seems to have begun as an internet trend more than a decade ago in South Korea.<!-- --> The name is a mash-up of the Korean words for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31130947" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">let\\u2019s eat (\\u201cmuk-ja\\u201d) and broadcasting (\\u201cbang-song\\u201d)</a>. Korean live-streamers often schedule their mukbang videos to align with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://qz.com/592710/why-some-koreans-make-10000-a-month-to-eat-on-camera/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">dinnertime hours</a>, so their viewers eating alone at home feel like they\\u2019re sharing a meal with a friend.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Viewers cite other benefits too. Watching the videos can serve as an appetite-curbing exercise. And for a certain subset, the sounds of a person eating foster an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/magazine/how-asmr-videos-became-a-sensation-youtube.html?module=inline" title="">autonomous sensory meridian response, or A.S.M.R.</a>; viewers derive pleasure from the sounds created by extra-loud crunching, slurping and lip smacking. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Craig Richard, 49, a professor of physiology at Shenandoah University and the creator of a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://asmruniversity.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">website dedicated to the study of A.S.M.R.</a>, said that while the phenomenon is not medically diagnosed, people who enjoy A.S.M.R. experience a sensation of \\u201csparkling brain tingles\\u201d while viewing \\u201ctrigger\\u201d videos.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On a recent Tuesday, Mrs. Gaskin sat down in her home studio for a recording session <!-- -->with her son Dalvin<!-- -->, who is 25 and something of a prot\\xe9g\\xe9, and his friend Nicole.<!-- --> On the walls were plaques commemorating the day she reached the one-million-subscriber mark on YouTube, as well as <!-- -->a framed letter from Susan Wojcicki, the C.E.O. of YouTube.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mrs. Gaskin began the show with a friendly singsong greeting: \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up my Bloveleez?,\\u201d a nickname she uses to refer to her viewers. Then she announced the night\\u2019s meal, elongating the vowels in \\u201cseafood boil\\u201d as a soccer commentator would when announcing a goal. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before diving into her food, she said a brief prayer: \\u201cHeavenly Father, in the name of Jesus, I thank you for this food I\\u2019m about to receive. In Jesus\\u2019s name, I pray. Amen.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The food was strategically positioned on a <!-- -->serving tray<!-- -->, with the most colorful items on top and accented by bright yellow lemons and corn on the cob. On the table in front of the tray were three glass bowls of Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s homemade Smackalicious sauce. She wants to manufacture the spices used in the sauce so viewers can make their own.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before taking the first bite of food, Mrs. Gaskin, Dalvin and Nicole<!-- --> <!-- -->briefly paused in front of the camera. They posed with a crab leg, and, while smiling, they sang the word \\u201cthumbnail.\\u201d After the photo, the real action began. Once Mrs. Gaskin dipped her food into her Smackalicious sauce, she took her first bite and closed her eyes as she chewed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While nodding, she said, \\u201cYup, umm hmm y\\u2019all, this is good.\\u201d<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>She used slurping noises to indicate that something was juicy, followed by more head nods and \\u201cyup\\u201d utterances, as well as some vaguely orgasmic sounds. Dr. Richard said that these \\u201cmouth sounds,\\u201d in combination with Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s \\u201ckind and positive disposition\\u201d and the abundance of the food, are textbook A.S.M.R. triggers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s house, these kinds of table manners aren\\u2019t punished but celebrated. She and her Bloveleez slurp and chew noisily and, as she put it, \\u201cunapologetically.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Perhaps the noisy and bad-mannered eating is off-putting for most, but the genre has a lot of devotees, if Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s success is any indication. Her primary YouTube channel, Bloveslife, has 1.8<!-- --> million subscribers<!-- -->, and on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/bloveslife2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Instagram</a> she has a following of nearly 900,000, one of whom is Cardi B. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Through advertising on her videos, Mrs. Gaskin said she has made more than $1 million, <!-- -->providing screenshots of a report from YouTube.<!-- --> </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before becoming a YouTube sensation, Mrs. Gaskin, who has an associate\\u2019s degree in early childhood development, owned a day care facility. After five years, she sold the business and used the money to pay off loans and leases. She then got a job making circuit boards for the military for a year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2017, she started making Food Network-style cooking videos in her home kitchen and posting them on YouTube. \\u201cI\\u2019m a foodie,\\u201d Mrs. Gaskin said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always liked to cook.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThen I did a mukbang, and people just went crazy,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was like, \\u2018People want to see me eat, this is weird,\\u2019 and since they were easier to record, I just started doing mukbangs and all of a sudden, it just took off from there.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s first mukbang video featured a seafood boil and a largely improvised monologue. Viewers left comments like: \\u201cSmacking, finger licking, straight getting down!! Just being yourself\\u2026very cool stuff!\\u201d and \\u201cI\\u2019m allergic so I can\\u2019t eat it, but you make me wanna take the risk of eating a fried shrimp, just in front of the Emergency Room.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cHer first 10 seafood boils were doing amazing, and I think it was the fifth one that was recognized by the \\u2018Stranger Things\\u2019 cast,\\u201d her son Darius, 18, said. His mother\\u2019s \\u201covernight\\u201d success is something he is still getting used to, more than two years into her YouTube career.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her husband, Nate, said that, in the beginning, he didn\\u2019t see how mukbang could help support the family.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWhen she first started this, I thought it was just going to be a hobby that she wanted to do,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut when it took off, it really changed the dynamic financially for our family, because in a very short period of time, she was making more money than I was.\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s success encouraged her husband to retire early from his 20-year managerial position at General Electric. Since then, Mr. Gaskin has been his wife\\u2019s full-time manager.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her audience has now surpassed that of the YouTubers who inspired her to pursue mukbang. She said that in particular videos by Jasper Daze, who died in 2016 after complications with diabetes, helped her pick shellfish as her cuisine of choice. She dedicated her first mukbang to him.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though the chatter around mukbang videos tends to focus on their benefits, there are also some who see reason for concern. Theresa Kinsella, 42, a dietitian, said in a phone interview that these videos \\u201cglorify overeating,\\u201d promote disordered eating and ignore the possible risks associated with overconsumption.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe short-term health risks are physical discomfort, gastrointestinal distress, lethargy and fatigue,\\u201d Ms. Kinsella said. As for the long-term effects, she cited weight gain, heart disease and diabetes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before the recording, Mrs. Gaskin, a surprisingly petite 4-foot-11, said that mukbang hasn\\u2019t affected her health. She eats only when she films, she said, which is on average twice a day.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of her fans send gifts. <!-- -->Others describe her as their \\u201cmedication,\\u201d<!-- --> Mrs. Gaskin said, adding that some cancer patients have thanked her for helping them regain their appetites.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Reese Anthony, 34, from St. Louis, Mo., is a fan of Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s fried chicken and shrimp dipping videos, and says that A.S.M.R. videos have helped him with his anxiety and depression. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWhen I first started watching these videos, and some of my friends knew I was watching these videos, they thought it was weird,\\u201d he <!-- -->said<!-- --> in a phone interview. \\u201cBut they don\\u2019t get it because they aren\\u2019t tapping into their senses.\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Anthony also alluded to the A.S.M.R. quality of Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s screen presence. \\u201cThe videos can put me to sleep and relax me,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt makes my hair on my arms stand up or gives me goose bumps because it\\u2019s so relaxing.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mrs. Gaskin credits her ability to appear authentic as a reason for her success. The other is her faith. \\u201cAs long as my family and God are behind me, I\\u2019m good,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd I wake up happy every day.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It wasn\\u2019t always easy. At one point during her childhood, Mrs. Gaskin said, she was homeless. \\u201cI know the struggle,\\u201d she said. \\u201cMy mom would sacrifice eating to make sure me and my brother ate.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That\\u2019s when Dalvin and Nicole walked through the door. Mrs. Gaskin asked, \\u201cDid y\\u2019all eat?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dalvin said they had not.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cDo y\\u2019all want to eat with me?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And the workday began.</p>]]', 'link': '/2019/06/11/style/youtube-mukbang-bloveslife-bethany-gaskin.html', 'title': '<title data-rh="true">The Queen of Eating Shellfish Online - The New York Times</title>'}
