And the reactions played out like a preview of the divisions the party could face in presidential politics and a key Senate race in 2020.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Arizona\\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, a proxy for the Republican establishment, predicted devastation if<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title=""> tariffs</a> were placed on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">Mexican imports</a> such as fruits and vegetables. Grass-roots Trump supporters \\u2014 who are often at odds with the business community \\u2014 stuck with the president.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWho cares about the price of an avocado when we\\u2019re having to pay for the illegals coming seeking asylum,\\u201d said Dodie Bell, a small-business owner in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler, voicing support for the president the day Mr. Trump announced a deal with Mexico and withdrew the tariff threat.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Tim Maiefski, a wealth manager out to dinner downtown, where restaurants sprayed cooling mists over outdoor tables, said that without immigrant labor, the state\\u2019s economy would grind to a halt. Mr. Maiefski, who has always voted straight Republican, wants his party to nominate someone else in 2020. \\u201cI hope to God they get somebody in there\\u201d other than Mr. Trump, he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those crosscurrents are on ample display in Chandler, a desert boomtown of 250,000 that reflects the demographic changes buffeting Arizona, a state where immigration is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ohpredictive.com/promotional-content/mo-dashboard/the-arizona-2018-2020-likely-voter-opinion-poll/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the top issue</a> for voters in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/politics/voter-polls/arizona.html?utm_term=.981aed834eae" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">polls</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The city, once farmland where ostriches were raised, was the first in the country to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.chandleraz.gov/news-center/chandler-first-nation-include-autonomous-vehicles-and-ride-sharing-zoning-code" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">rewrite its zoning code</a> to make way for self-driving cars. High-tech employers like Intel lure transplants from California, India and West Africa who have brought with them more liberal views.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once staunchly Republican, many Chandler precincts were colored purple on a map of last year\\u2019s midterms. Swing voters helped elect Democrats to the United States Senate, the secretary of state\\u2019s office and, for the first time in the city\\u2019s memory, the State Legislature.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, both parties believe that Arizona, which <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">Mr. Trump</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/arizona?module=inline" title="">won by about 90,000 votes</a>, or 3.5 percentage points, is in play in the 2020 presidential race. Who wins will come down, in no small part, to places like Chandler, with its well-educated independent voters.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics?smid=rd%3Faction%3Dclick&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up for our politics newsletter</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> and join our conversation about the 2020 presidential race.]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Maiefski and his girlfriend, Tricia Mitchell, had passed a roofing crew in their neighborhood laboring outdoors in 103-degree heat. \\u201cThey work harder than anybody,\\u201d Ms. Mitchell, an analyst for a tech firm, said of immigrants.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Mitchell did not vote in 2016. But she plans to show up next year \\u2014 to cast a ballot against the president. She has a Hispanic daughter from an earlier relationship, and ever since Mr. Trump\\u2019s election, she said, her daughter has faced racial hostility.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To Democrats, the importance of making inroads in the Sun Belt followed the thunderclap of 2016, when Mr. Trump\\u2019s appeal to white voters without a college degree won him Rust Belt states that had seemed permanently out of Republicans\\u2019 reach.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If the president is able to hold on to even one of the so-called blue-wall states he won in 2016 \\u2014 Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \\u2014 Democrats must find somewhere else to win.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To many analysts, Arizona could be that somewhere else, thanks to the influx of college-educated transplants and the mobilization of Latino voters, especially young Latinos, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://kjzz.org/content/923981/2018-midterms-saw-massive-turnout-women-latino-and-young-voters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">whose turnout in 2018</a> was higher than the 2016 presidential race \\u2014 highly unusual for a midterm.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThis is not your dad\\u2019s Arizona anymore,\\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, a Republican consultant in the state. He said Midwest retirees, the traditional conservative base, were aging and being replaced by younger, more diverse and independent voters.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Recently, Mr. Coughlin sent a copy of a New York Times opinion column headlined \\u201c<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/opinion/republicans-generation-gap.html?module=inline" title="">The Coming G.O.P. Apocalypse</a>\\u201d to the Trump campaign\\u2019s Arizona state director, Drew Sexton.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI\\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this column,\\u201d he wrote. It noted that only 12 percent of millennials identify as mostly or consistently conservative.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cGot lots of thoughts,\\u201d Mr. Sexton, himself a millennial, replied, according to Mr. Coughlin. \\u201cMost of them bum me out.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other Republican strategists said Arizona, which has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1996, is not about to flip next year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cEvery two years my friends on the left side of the spectrum declare that this is the election that will prove Arizona has become a purple swing state,\\u201d said Stan Barnes, a former Republican state lawmaker who is now a lobbyist. \\u201cEvery year it ends up falling short.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said that even though Mr. Trump\\u2019s approval was 45 percent in Arizona, with 51 percent disapproval, the Democratic nominee was likely to be outside the state\\u2019s mainstream.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most recently, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democrat whom Arizona Republican strategists most fear, abandoned decades of support for a ban on federal money to pay for abortions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe Democratic Party seems determined to miss this moment and lurch to the left,\\u201d Mr. Barnes said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re going to be so far outside the spectrum of Arizona politics that Donald Trump becomes more attractive, even if you don\\u2019t like his style and some of his policies.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last year\\u2019s Senate race, won by Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat, is a lens through which both parties interpret the political lay of the land. Republicans argue that Ms. Sinema won by regularly voting for Trump priorities as a congresswoman, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2018/04/01/kyrsten-sinema-tom-ohalleran-side-donald-trump-more-often-than-some-republicans/471206002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">siding with the president</a> more than some Republicans \\u2014 a centrism no Democratic presidential nominee would espouse.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To Democrats, Ms. Sinema successfully branded herself as an \\u201cArizonan,\\u201d neither Democrat nor Republican, and her opponent, Martha McSally, damaged herself with independents by hugging Mr. Trump too tightly.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. McSally, a former Air Force combat pilot, was later appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated when Senator John McCain died last year. She will probably be on the ballot again in 2020, likely facing Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, in one of the decisive races for Senate control.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A factor that some Republicans fear could further alienate independents in both the presidential and Senate races is the resurgence of the far-right fringe in Arizona, which Mr. McCain had fought to marginalize.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In January, the hard right elected as state Republican chairwoman Kelli Ward, whom national Republicans have attacked as a conspiracy theorist. Donations to the state party <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/KelliWardAZ/photos/a.172389932849085/2211405948947463/?type=3&amp;theater" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">have fallen sharply</a> under Ms. Ward. Recently, she <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2019/05/20/how-extremists-reasserting-themselves-into-mainstream-gop-politics-arizona-republican-party/3568202002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">shared a stage with far-right figures</a> at a suburban rally supported by three \\u201cpatriot\\u201d organizations <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2019/04/12/four-things-know-about-next-weeks-patriotism-over-socialism-rally-arizona" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">identified as hate groups</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a telephone town hall last week, Ms. McSally faced a wave of criticism from grass-roots Republicans for breaking with Mr. Trump on his threat of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">Mexican tariffs</a>, which the senator warned would harm the state economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWe\\u2019re being invaded,\\u201d parried a caller from Tucson, according to a transcript provided by a person who recorded the event. \\u201cI don\\u2019t see why the Republicans don\\u2019t stick together on this.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A second caller demanded, \\u201cOn the record today, are you going to support Donald Trump if he goes ahead with tariffs?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Arizonans have more knowledge and experience of the porous border than most Americans do, and voters are sharply divided over Mr. Trump\\u2019s harsh language about migrants, his demand for a wall and his handling of a surge in Central American families seeking asylum.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">John Giles, the Republican mayor of Mesa, said Mr. Trump would win the state again, but he cautioned, \\u201cThe president would be well served to soften his rhetoric when it comes to immigration if he wants to be successful in Arizona.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Voters in Chandler, as elsewhere, often fell into two camps: those who complain that taxpayers are providing services to undeserving, undocumented immigrants, and those who said migrants\\u2019 economic contributions were substantial, and they deserved empathy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThere\\u2019s too many coming over, the state\\u2019s taking care of millions, something\\u2019s got to happen to stop it,\\u201d said Eileen Cram, a retired school administrator, who moved to Chandler from Oregon.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She plans to vote for Mr. Trump a second time. \\u201cSomebody has to be in there that\\u2019s strong, and he\\u2019s strong \\u2014 not wishy-washy,\\u201d she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another educator, Altreana Anderson, 43, a former principal of a primary school with a majority Hispanic population, said the real crisis was the failure to meet the health care needs of undocumented children and to offer legal work status to their parents, which traps families in poverty.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI do understand peoples\\u2019 frustrations with them not paying taxes,\\u201d Ms. Anderson said. \\u201cIf you gave them citizenship, they would pay into the system just as you and I do.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She plans to vote against Mr. Trump for a second time in 2020. \\u201cHe\\u2019s been wrong since Day 1,\\u201d about immigration, accusing Mexico of sending criminals and rapists, she said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWe are getting some very good people,\\u201d she said. \\u201cPeople I trust and love. We have no problem employing them. Walk into any neighborhood, and I can guarantee they have a landscaper who is undocumented.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Betty Iparraguirre, who voted for Mr. Trump, said she will not do so again.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI thought because he wasn\\u2019t a politician he would be different,\\u201d said Ms. Iparraguirre, a real estate agent whose family is from Mexico.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI can\\u2019t understand half of what he\\u2019s saying,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s almost like watching a reality TV show.
