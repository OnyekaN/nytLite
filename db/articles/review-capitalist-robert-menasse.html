{'body': '[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It would be a mistake to call Robert Menasse\\u2019s melancholy and satirical \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d a great food novel. It has a lot more on its mind than breakfasts, lunches and dinners.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But it opens, after a prologue, with a question \\u2014 \\u201cWho invented mustard?\\u201d \\u2014 and takes off from there. By the next page, the author is describing \\u201cstaring at mustard on a plate while a sausage burns in the frying pan as a clear and typical symptom of depression.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Menasse\\u2019s roomy novel is set in contemporary Brussels, and its characters can often be found consuming throwback comfort foods like <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">stoemp</em>, a sausage and potato dish, and impenetrable stews such as <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">waterzooi</em> and <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">bigos</em>, and sighing with happiness. A lot of cigarettes are lit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It would be a mistake, too, to call \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d a great novel of the European Union, though some have tried. (The book has received deservingly rapturous reviews abroad.) Menasse\\u2019s novel is in part about bureaucratic infighting at the E.U., a subject he manages to make not just interesting but drolly comic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Make no mistake: The author admires this institution and the notion of pushing past the nationalism that has tilted the world toward racism and war. But he can\\u2019t help but satirize the vanities of his career-minded characters, with their little wheelie suitcases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If you tasked an excellent writer with turning a tall stack of recent issues of The Economist into a novel, you might get \\u201cThe Capital.\\u201d Somehow I mean this as high praise.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Born in 1954, Menasse is Austrian and well-known in Europe. He\\u2019s published many books of fiction and nonfiction, and has received dozens of accolades. Few of his books have been translated into English, however. This is a situation, I predict, that will soon change.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Perhaps what we have in \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d is a great murder mystery. The book opens with an assassination in a hotel, a murky, John le Carr\\xe9-world sort of event.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It\\u2019s an unusual murder story, though, because the suspense lies not in discovering the identity of the assassin (we follow him as he goes on the lam) but the identity of the dead man. You come to suspect that the murder is a kind of MacGuffin, that maybe it doesn\\u2019t matter at all.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I enjoyed \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d so much that I could keep going like this. It\\u2019s possible this is a great Holocaust-minded novel for a new millennium. Some of its characters are survivors of Auschwitz; others visit it. Still others think long and hard about the meanings to which the camp can be put as a symbol of the need for overcoming national sentiment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One survivor meets yet another young person with a shaved head and tattoos and loses his cool. \\u201cDid they know what they were doing, what they were expressing, what associations they were evoking?\\u201d He thinks: \\u201cYou\\u2019re insulting the world\\u2019s memory!\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the end I think \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d may be a major book about coincidences, of linked and overlapping meanings. G.K. Chesterton thought of coincidences as \\u201cspiritual puns.\\u201d For Menasse they have similar meaning. In this Balzac-like novel, he introduces us to a dozen or so characters \\u2014 bureaucrats, police inspectors, academics, lobbyists \\u2014 and spins them around one another. Their lives intersect and chime in resonant ways.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of these characters is Fenia Xenopoulou, a Greek woman turning 40 who has been given a job with no clout and almost no budget, as head of communications for the Directorate-General for Culture. She needs to get out. She kisses up, sleeping with a powerful colleague, and kicks down, ordering one of her subordinates, a sympathetic man named Martin Susman, to come up with an idea to help her consolidate her power.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We meet an economist, Grace Atkinson, who hopes to escape the blame when Martin\\u2019s idea goes awry. A police inspector, \\xc9mile Brunfaut, pushes back against a political cover-up of the hotel murder. An aging Austrian academic named Alois Erhart tells difficult truths about European nationalism, truths no one wants to hear.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Alois reminds us that everything is getting worse. The nature of truth has been degraded. Tabloids stir up base instincts and abet the rise of heinous old ghosts. \\u201cHe had been prepared for everything,\\u201d we read, in a line made for the age of Donald Trump, \\u201cbut not everything in caricature.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The heavy tourism in Brussels weighs on everyone, too. About \\xc9mile, the police inspector, Menasse writes: \\u201cBack in 1914, his grandfather had said, Brussels was the richest and most beautiful city in the world \\u2014 then they came three times, twice in their boots with rifles, the third time in their trainers with cameras.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is a deeply humane novel, a novel for adults. It carries the wisdom and weight and weariness of late middle age. Menasse writes not about the way things should be but about the way things are, rare enough these days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The translation, by Jamie Bulloch, is adroit. Yet \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d made me want to learn to read in German, where it is surely even better.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is a baggy book, with room for everything Menasse wants to put into it. It has its share of longueurs. But there is also pointed writing not just about politics but about subways and orgasms and woolly underwear and air conditioning and retirement homes. You will learn a surprising amount about European pork production.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">W.H. Auden lamented, near the end of his life, that nothing he wrote saved a single Jew from the ovens. It\\u2019s hard to reckon with the political impact a book like \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d might have. I suspect it will be nil.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But this novel evidences a sharp awareness of the forces remaking European life, with Brexit as only one example. Ties are coming apart. To borrow a line from Ali Smith\\u2019s recent novel, \\u201cSpring,\\u201d \\u201cHow\\u2019re you doing, apart from the end of liberal capitalist democracy?\\u201d</p>]]', 'link': '/2019/06/10/books/review-capitalist-robert-menasse.html', 'title': '<title data-rh="true">\xe2\x80\x98The Capital\xe2\x80\x99 Is a Sharp Political Satire About Europe at This Perilous Moment - The New York Times</title>'}
