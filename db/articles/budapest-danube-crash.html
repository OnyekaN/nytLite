The cause is still under investigation, but the accident has raised concerns that at the municipal and national levels, where tourism has become a major source of revenue, political calculations and the drive for profit outweighed safety concerns.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Either the national government or the city, both controlled by Prime Minister Viktor Orban\\u2019s Fidesz party, could have acted to limit the number of ships and boats operating in Budapest; the national tourism agency grants permits to sightseeing vessels, while the city controls access to the docks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cCity officials were warned about the dangers of too much traffic,\\u201d said Gabor Demszky, the mayor of Budapest from 1990 to 2010. \\u201cBut they failed to act. It is a very profitable business.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, a floating crane slowly lifted the Mermaid to the surface, and divers recovered four bodies from the wreck. The vessel carried 33 tourists from South Korea and two crew members; only seven of those aboard survived, and several of the victims have still not been found.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/asia/sewol-ferry-accident.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The accident had resonance in South Korea, whose own ferry industry remains troubled even after the deaths of 250 schoolchildren in a sinking.</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The 64-year-old Ukrainian captain of the Viking Sigyn, identified only as Yuriy C., has been arrested on suspicion of negligence. Viking Cruises confirmed reports that he was part of the crew of another ship, the Viking Idun, that was involved in a collision in the Netherlands in April, raising questions about how he had been allowed to take the helm of one of the newest and largest vessels in the company\\u2019s fleet.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But beyond the role of human error, people have long pointed to the risks of heavy river traffic through Budapest \\u2014 especially at night, when tourist vessels offer views of the city at its most spectacular. City officials have been warned, in at least two reports, that the number of vessels navigating this stretch of the Danube and the lack of communication between international and local ships could pose a danger.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A 2013 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://budapest.hu/Documents/V%C3%A1ros%C3%A9p%C3%ADt%C3%A9si%20F%C5%91oszt%C3%A1ly/_Budapest%20Duna-menti%20ter%C3%BCeteinek%20fejleszt%C3%A9si%20tanulm%C3%A1nyterve%201.%20k%C3%B6tet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">development study</a> commissioned by the city warned that the increase in hotel boats \\u201chas led to numerous points of tension,\\u201d including overcrowding on the waterway. This year, a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://budapest.hu/Documents/20190411_Bp_Mobilit%C3%A1si_Terv_2030_egyeztet%C3%A9si%20v%C3%A1ltozat.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">transportation development study</a> prepared by the Budapest Transportation Authority found that more \\u201ccooperation was needed between professional and tourism-related vessels on the Budapest\\u201d stretch of the Danube.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Hungarian tourism agency said that the country complied with all international regulations regarding the waterway, including those regarding the safe navigation of large vessels.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThere are several indications that human error was responsible,\\u201d the agency said, adding that it expressed its deepest condolences to the victims of the tragedy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The newest cruise ships, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vikingrivercruises.co.uk/ships/longships/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">known as longships</a>, are essentially floating hotels, almost 450 feet long and able to accommodate several hundred guests.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hotel ships, like the 442-foot Viking Sigyn, must compete for space with local sightseeing vessels like the Mermaid, an 89-foot, Soviet-era vessel, as well as with industrial transport barges, permanently docked restaurants and other floating structures used for entertainment. Budapest residents say the increased volume is striking, as is the rise in air pollution from the ships.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Danube stretches some 1,800 miles from Germany to the Black Sea and flows through 10 countries, making it hard to get a complete picture of river traffic and safety.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.inland-navigation-market.org/en/rapports/2018/q2/7-river-cruises/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a study cofinanced by the European Commission</a> released in April 2018 found that the amount of traffic on the Danube, measured at the German-Austrian border, increased by 89 percent from 2002 to 2017. It also reported that the number of cruise vessels plying the river more than doubled from 2004 to 2017, to 346 ships with 50,616 beds.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Capt. Branislav Vajda, the president of the Association of Professional Carriers of Serbia, said that crowding on the Danube in and around Belgrade, that country\\u2019s capital, was so severe, \\u201cit is only a matter of time before we have a tragedy of our own to announce.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy found <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1937/05/20/archives/54-hurt-as-budapest-hails-victor-emmanuel-the-citys-first-royal.html?module=inline" title="">when he visited Budapest in 1937</a> and his hosts lit up the majestic Chain Bridge for the first time, the city\\u2019s imperial grandeur is at its most magical at night. And the best vantage point for seeing the sights, from Buda Castle to the monumental Parliament building, is the river.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe government and the oligarchs around the government officials, are always looking for new resources and, in this business, they found one,\\u201d said Mr. Demszky, the former mayor.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said that the current mayor, Istvan Tarlos, an ally of Mr. Orban, was supported by the national government, \\u201cso he is not really free to act.\\u201d Mr. Tarlos declined to respond to a request for an interview.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the days after the accident, according to people familiar with the tourism industry, scores of boats seemed to disappear as the authorities cracked down on those operating without the proper permits. But many said they believed the moves were only temporary.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Orban and his Fidesz party have near complete control over the state and have been exerting increasing influence over the private economy, including tourism, one of the most profitable sectors. Mr. Orban\\u2019s daughter, Rahel Orban, who has a master\\u2019s degree in hospitality management from the private <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ehl.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">\\xc9cole H\\xf4teli\\xe8re de Lausanne</a> in Switzerland, is an unpaid adviser to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://abouthungary.hu/hungarian-tourism-agency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Hungarian Tourism Agency</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2016, Mr. Orban earmarked more than $3 billion in public funds for tourism ventures across Hungary up to 2030, including a $1 billion resort complex near Lake Balaton. Ms. Orban\\u2019s husband, Istvan Tiborcz, has come under criticism for his stake in the development. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/hungary-orban-balaton/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">A Reuters investigation published in 2018</a> found that Mr. Tiborcz \\u201cstands to collect almost half of any profits from a venture which acquired the resort\\u2019s biggest hotel.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Hungarian Tourism Agency, which manages all tourism-related projects, including those funded by the European Union, is overseen by the Prime Minister\\u2019s Office and co-owns the slips for international ships along the Budapest stretch of the Danube.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe authorities should examine whether business considerations unduly overruled expert opinions that the increased hotel boat traffic on the Danube River in Budapest may cause serious accidents,\\u201d said Miklos Ligeti, legal director for the public information advocacy group <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://transparency.hu/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Transparency International</a> in Hungary. \\u201cIf this can be established, there is a serious indication of gross negligence which should be prosecuted.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials from Viking Cruises declined to answer questions about overcrowding on the river, but industry officials noted that river cruise ships remain among the safest modes of travel, with a record better even than the airline industry.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Zsolt Varga, head of the Hungarian Federation of Passenger Fleet Operators, said he did not believe that the recent tragedy was the result of overcrowding.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThose two boats could have been the only boats on the Danube at that time and this still could have happened,\\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, he acknowledged that there was concern about coordination between local boats and the larger cruise ships. That is why, he said, a new rule was instituted last year requiring ships doing a sightseeing loop in Budapest to travel past the Arpad Bridge in the north and Rakoczi Bridge in the south before making turns.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">David Szekeres, a 47-year-old boat captain who trains skippers with his Gabriella Sailing company, said navigating around Budapest presented specific challenges, including jetties unmarked on maps and navigation markers in the wrong places. Within the city, the Danube rises and falls as much as eight meters \\u2014 more than in other cities, where dams and levees regulate the flow. When the river is running high and fast, it carries all sorts of debris, and leaves little room for error passing under bridges.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not all those at the helm are up to the task, Mr. Szekeres said, in part because the licensing process has been weakened.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For instance, he said that the test for a pilot license for boats under 20 feet changed in 2013, when a former government official took over a company that trained pilots for the written part of the exam.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to learn anything about sailing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou just have to learn the exact answers to pass the test.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was near the Margaret Bridge that the accident took place.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the Viking ship bore down on the Mermaid from behind, investigators said, there was no radio communication between them. No warning horn was sounded.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The inquiry has been hampered by treacherous currents and poor underwater visibility. The Viking ship left Budapest for Passau, Germany, less than two days after the fatal collision.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gyorgy Magyar, a Hungarian lawyer representing the family of the Hungarian crewman aboard the Mermaid, said it was wrong for the authorities to allow the Viking to depart from Budapest so soon after the accident.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThat vessel was involved in an accident and it is evidence that shouldn\\u2019t be released until the professional and all-encompassing investigation has concluded,\\u201d he said. Letting it leave means \\u201cthe evidence has been tampered with,\\u201d he added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some clues as to the cause of the crash might be revealed now that the Mermaid has been recovered from the riverbed. But whatever investigators find, it will not change what people who know the Danube have long said is the basic problem.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cFor me, it is overcrowded,\\u201d Mr. Szekeres said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cAnd now, you have these really big cruise ships doing sightseeing tours, and they are just too big,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThey should not be doing this. Especially at night.\\u201d</p>]]', 'link': '/2019/06/11/world/europe/budapest-danube-crash.html', 'title': '<title data-rh="true">Before Fatal Boat Crash in Budapest, Safety Warnings Went Unheeded - The New York Times</title>'}
