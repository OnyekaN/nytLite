Biden Jr. repeatedly ripped into each other on Tuesday as unfit to lead the country as they both traveled to the battleground state of Iowa, giving voters a preview of what a general election matchup between the two men might look like.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the most ferocious day of attacks in the six-month-old presidential campaign, Mr. Trump resorted to taunts and name-calling over several hours, saying Mr. Biden was \\u201ca loser,\\u201d \\u201ca sleepy guy\\u201d and \\u201cthe weakest mentally,\\u201d and claiming that \\u201cpeople don\\u2019t respect him.\\u201d Mr. Biden took a different tack, laying out ways Mr. Trump was \\u201can existential threat\\u201d to the country, its international standing and its values.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden, who leads in early polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, also brought up subjects he had previously avoided with reporters, such as Mr. Trump siding with the North Korean state media\\u2019s insults on Mr. Biden\\u2019s I.Q.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201dHe embraces dictators like Kim Jong-un, who\\u2019s a damn murderer and a thug?\\u201d Mr. Biden said at his second event of the day, in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. \\u201cThe one thing they agree on: Joe Biden, he shouldn\\u2019t be president.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The hostile exchanges, which went back and forth across multiple Iowa campaign stops, were the clearest evidence yet that the two men see political advantages in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/trump-biden-iowa.html?module=inline" title="">waging a battle against one another</a> at this early stage of the race.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden has largely ignored his 22 Democratic rivals while building his campaign around the urgent need to oust Mr. Trump. Rather than get drawn into squabbles with more liberal candidates or lesser-known ones, he is trying to present himself as presidential material and the most electable Democrat against Mr. Trump \\u2014 particularly in swing states like Iowa, where the president trounced Hillary Clinton in 2016 after Barack Obama carried the state in 2008 and 2012.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump, mindful of polling that shows him trailing Mr. Biden in several key states, has targeted him with ridicule lately, far more than he has the other Democratic candidates. While the 2020 general election campaign is still a year away, Mr. Trump is repurposing some of his most effective ad hominem attacks from the last election.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In his remarks at an ethanol plant in Council Bluffs, for instance, Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Biden\\u2019s only message was to criticize him, and then brought up his oft-repeated insult for his 2016 opponent, Mrs. Clinton.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThat reminds me of Crooked Hillary,\\u201d Mr. Trump said, earning chuckles from the audience. \\u201cShe did the same thing. And then when it came time to vote, they all said, \\u2018You know, she doesn\\u2019t like Trump very much, but what does she stand for?\\u2019 Same thing is happening with Sleepy Joe.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While they have attacked each other from a distance, their appearances in the same state on Tuesday seemed primed to intensify the hostility. Mr. Biden wasted no time trying to frame the debate, releasing excerpts at 6 a.m. Tuesday from the remarks he had prepared to deliver at a speech in Davenport in the evening.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Throughout the day, Mr. Biden laced into Mr. Trump over a range of policy issues, such as pursuing an \\u201cerratic war on trade\\u201d and his approach to tariff negotiations, as farmers \\u2014 including in this heavily agricultural state \\u2014 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/china-tariffs-republicans.html?module=inline" title="">have struggled</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the sharpest part of Mr. Biden\\u2019s remarks in Davenport was his argument that, while the nation \\u201ccan overcome four years of this presidency,\\u201d Mr. Trump would pose an existential threat to \\u201cthe character of this nation\\u201d if he were re-elected and served another term.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He portrayed Mr. Trump\\u2019s words and actions as antithetical to the nation\\u2019s \\u201ccore values \\u2014 what we stand for, who we are, what we believe in,\\u201d citing the president\\u2019s child separation policy at the southern border and referencing his remark that there were \\u201cvery fine people on both sides\\u201d of the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden also argued that Mr. Trump was a threat to \\u201cour standing in the world,\\u201d noting that the president has attacked NATO while embracing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and saying he had shown poor character by using \\u201ccrude language\\u201d and \\u201cembarrassing behavior that is burrowing deep into our culture.\\u201d And he said Mr. Trump was undermining American democracy by criticizing law enforcement agencies, defying the authority of Congress and using phrases like \\u201cenemy of the people\\u201d to describe a free press.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cIn 2020, we not only have to repudiate Donald Trump\\u2019s policies and values \\u2014 we have to clearly and fully reject, for our own safety\\u2019s sake, his view of the presidency,\\u201d Mr. Biden said. \\u201cQuote: \\u2018I have complete power.\\u2019 No you don\\u2019t, Donald Trump.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201c\\u2018Only I can fix it.\\u2019 Fix yourself first,\\u201d Mr. Biden said as the crowd enthusiastically drowned him out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The early excerpts from Mr. Biden\\u2019s remarks received prominent attention in the news media on Tuesday morning. Mr. Trump, as he departed the Oval Office, told reporters that he thought Mr. Biden was \\u201ca loser\\u201d and questioned his mental fitness.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI\\u2019d rather run against, I think, Biden than anybody,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think he\\u2019s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally. I think Joe is the weakest up here. The other ones have much more energy.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After arriving in Council Bluffs, Mr. Trump hinted that he was waiting until his kickoff rally on June 18 in Orlando for his official \\u201cpolitical season\\u201d to begin. But he couldn\\u2019t help but take glancing blows at Mr. Biden in between touting the low unemployment rate and the boom in blue-collar jobs. \\u201cHe was someplace in Iowa today and he said my name so many times that people couldn\\u2019t stand it anymore,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201c\\u2018No, don\\u2019t keep saying it.\\u2019 Sleepy guy.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Later, Mr. Trump noted that America \\u201cwould never be treated with respect\\u201d under Mr. Biden\\u2019s leadership, \\u201cbecause people don\\u2019t respect him.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The attacks by Mr. Trump were, in one way, a boost for Mr. Biden after days of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/politics/biden-abortion-hyde-amendment.html?module=inline" title="">Democratic criticism over his shifting stances</a> on federal funding for abortion. On Tuesday, there was wall-to-wall cable news coverage of the Trump-Biden feud, not of abortion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden, responding to reporters\\u2019 questions in Iowa after Mr. Trump\\u2019s attacks, laughed off the president\\u2019s remarks about his stamina and mental fitness, and repeated his past statements that voters have a right to question all of the candidates\\u2019 ages.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cLook at him and look at me and answer the question,\\u201d Mr. Biden said, when one reporter raised those comments. \\u201cIt\\u2019s self-evident, you know it\\u2019s a ridiculous assertion on his part.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pressed specifically on Mr. Trump\\u2019s remark that Mr. Biden is \\u201cweak mentally,\\u201d the former vice president laughed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to stoop down to where he is,\\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden\\u2019s face-off against Mr. Trump on Tuesday could have downsides, some Democratic strategists cautioned.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe Biden campaign clearly seems to relish sparring with Trump. In their minds, they believe it elevates him above the rest of the Democratic field,\\u201d said Brian Fallon, who served as press secretary for Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s 2016 campaign. \\u201cThe potential downside is that, as Trump road tests different attacks on Biden, it may help the Democratic primary electorate better visualize potential vulnerabilities that Biden would have in a general election.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Fallon said that if any of those attacks \\u2014 from his supposed lack of energy to his support for the 1994 crime bill \\u2014 changed voter perceptions, \\u201cthat could erode the aura of electability that is right now Biden\\u2019s strongest asset.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday night, Mr. Trump skipped over Mr. Biden and focused on painting top Democrats as socialists. In a red-meat speech to a red-cap-wearing crowd of 700 Iowa Republicans in West Des Moines, Mr. Trump argued, without evidence, that the United States could tumble into a state of decline like Venezuela under the wrong leadership. He notably name-checked Senator Bernie Sanders, who is set to give a speech on democratic socialism on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cMore than 100 Democrats have signed up for the Bernie Sanders government takeover of health care,\\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Sanders\\u2019s \\u201cMedicare for all\\u201d plan. \\u201cWe have 180 million Americans having great private health care. That would all be taken away. Democrats also support the $100 trillion Green New Deal, how about that beauty.\\u201d Making an oblique reference to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Trump said the bill was \\u201cmade up by a young woman, who is, well, let\\u2019s see how she works out.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Public and private polls that show Mr. Trump trailing Mr. Biden in critical states have contributed to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/trump-biden-iowa.html?module=inline" title="">his preoccupation with Mr. Biden</a>, whom the president has told aides to describe as old and feeble (Mr. Biden is 76; Mr. Trump will turn 73 this week).</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Up to this point, Mr. Biden has largely resisted responding to Mr. Trump\\u2019s individual broadsides, insisting repeatedly that he wants to avoid a \\u201cmud-wrestling match\\u201d with the president and often ignoring shouted questions from reporters about Mr. Trump\\u2019s remarks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But that hardly means Mr. Biden avoids discussing Mr. Trump. He is centering his campaign squarely on defeating the president, calling him an \\u201caberration.\\u201d It is a point of emphasis <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/us/politics/biden-trump-republicans-2020.html?module=inline" title="">sharply at odds with several of his Democratic opponents</a>, who believe Trumpism has redefined the Republican Party and say the country needs bigger, structural change that goes beyond defeating one man.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At every turn, Mr. Biden is seeking to keep the focus on a possible general election matchup between himself and Mr. Trump. He has recently visited Pennsylvania and Ohio, important general election swing states, arguing that he is able to connect in the industrial Midwest and torching Mr. Trump\\u2019s leadership approach.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While many of the voters who filed into his Ottumwa event shared Mr. Biden\\u2019s near-single-minded focus on Mr. Trump, praising Mr. Biden as someone who could appeal to moderates and independents, Cheri Scherr, 63, said she had hoped to hear \\u201cmore about his ideas.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI wish he would talk less about Trump,\\u201d said Ms. Scherr, of Pella, Iowa. \\u201cWe\\u2019re Democrats, we know why we don\\u2019t like Trump.\\u201d</p>]]', 'link': '/2019/06/11/us/politics/iowa-trump-biden.html', 'title': '<title data-rh="true">Trump and Biden Get Personal in Iowa Skirmish - The New York Times</title>'}
