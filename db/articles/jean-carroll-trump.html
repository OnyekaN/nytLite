Jean Carroll, who wrote for years for Elle magazine, was “lying” when she said that he threw her up against a wall and forced himself on her in the mid-1990s, and he insisted that he did not know her.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’ll say it with great respect,” he said in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/450116-trump-vehemently-denies-e-jean-carroll-allegation-shes-not-my-type" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">an interview with The Hill</a>, a Capitol Hill news organization. “No. 1, she’s not my type. No. 2, it never happened. It never happened, O.K.?”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Earlier Monday, Ms. Carroll spoke about an excerpt from her new book — “What Do We Need Men For?” — that was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/06/donald-trump-assault-e-jean-carroll-other-hideous-men.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published in New York magazine</a>. She said in an interview on CNN that Mr. Trump threw her up against a wall so hard that “I hit my head really hard: boom.” She said that she tried to fight back against Mr. Trump’s violent advances in a fitting room of Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the Hill interview, Mr. Trump said Ms. Carroll was making up the story. “Totally lying. I don’t know anything about her,” he said. “I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is — it’s just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump in the past has rejected other sexual assault accusations by asserting that the women who accused him of taking advantage of them were not attractive enough to engage in such behavior.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you,” Trump told supporters at a campaign event in 2016 after a woman accused him of putting his hand up her skirt while on an airplane. “You don’t know. That would not be my first choice.” As the crowd laughed, he said, “Check out her Facebook, you’ll understand.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fitting room episode took place in late 1995 or early 1996, according to Ms. Carroll, who said Monday that Mr. Trump asked her to model lingerie that he was looking to purchase. At the time, Mr. Trump was married to Marla Maples. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The minute he closed that door, I was banged up against the wall,” Ms. Carroll said during an appearance on “New Day” with <!-- -->Alisyn Camerota<!-- -->. “I want women to know that I did not stand there. I did not freeze. I was not paralyzed, which is a reaction I could have had because it was so shocking. No, I fought.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Our executive editor </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/reader-center/e-jean-carroll-trump-allegations.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">revisits how The Times initially handled</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> E.

CNN played the 2005 clip during Ms. Carroll’s appearance on Monday. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It knocked me back; I felt relief,” Ms. Carroll said. “We have to change this culture of sexual violence.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More than a dozen women have accused Mr. Trump of sexual misconduct that they said took place before he was elected president. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s the same,” Ms. Carroll said. “He denies it. He turns it around. He attacks and then he threatens. I am sick of it. Think how many women have come forward. Nothing happens.” </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Carroll, 75, stopped short of using the word “rape” on Monday to characterize the episode, which she said in the New York magazine excerpt that she disclosed to two friends at the time. One urged her to report it to the police, while a journalist friend warned her to keep quiet because Mr. Trump would “bury you.” The New York Times spoke to the two friends, who confirmed that Ms. Carroll had spoken about it with them but said they did not want to be identified.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I have difficulty with the word,” Ms. Carroll, the author of “Ask E. Jean” in Elle, said Monday. “I see it as a fight. He pulled down my tights. It was over very quickly. It was against my will 100 percent.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Carroll rejected the president’s contention that she was motivated by publicity for her book. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Male authors never get this question,” Ms. Carroll said. “It was not about selling a book about Donald Trump.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement on Friday, the president said he had never met Ms. Carroll, but the two were photographed together at a party in 1987 with Ms. Carroll’s former husband, John Johnson. Mr. Trump said on Saturday that the image was misleading. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Standing with my coat on in a line?” Mr. Trump said. “Give me a break — with my back to the camera? I have no idea who she is.”</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Neil Vigdor from New York.</em></p>]
