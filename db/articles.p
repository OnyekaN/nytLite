Secretly funded by Sergey Brin, a co-founder of Google, the journey from petri dish to plate had cost $325,000 \\u2014 making theirs the most expensive meal in history. Fortunately, the results were promising: Hanni R\\xfctzler, a nutrition scientist, concluded that the patty was \\u201c<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23996-whats-the-beef-cultured-meat-remains-a-distant-dream/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">close to meat but not as juicy</a>.\\u201d The next question was whether this breakthrough could be made cheaper. Much cheaper.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first \\u201ccultured <!-- -->beef<!-- -->\\u201d burgers are likely to enter the market next year, at approximately $50 each. But that won\\u2019t last long. Within a decade they will probably be more affordable than even the cheapest barbecue staples of today \\u2014 all for a product that uses fewer resources, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2011-06-21-lab-grown-meat-would-cut-emissions-and-save-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">produces negligible greenhouse gases</a> and, remarkably, requires no animals to die.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It\\u2019s not just barbecues and burgers. Last year Just, a leader in cellular agriculture, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2018/12/11/JUST-strikes-deal-in-Japan-to-bring-cell-cultured-Wagyu-beef-to-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cut a deal</a> to start producing one of the world\\u2019s tastiest steaks, Wagyu. A company called Endless West, which also makes grapeless wine, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://endlesswest.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">has started to produce Glyph</a>, the world\\u2019s first \\u201cmolecular whiskey.\\u201d Luxury could be coming to all.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The case of cultured food and drink, far from a curiosity, is a template for a better, freer and more affluent world, a world where we provide for the needs of everyone \\u2014 in style.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But how do we get there?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To say the present era is one of crisis borders on clich\\xe9. It differs from the dystopias of George Orwell or Aldous Huxley, or hell in the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. It is unlike Europe during the Black Death or Central Asia as it faced the Mongols. And yet it is true: Ours is an age of crisis. We inhabit a world of low growth, low productivity and low wages, of climate breakdown and the collapse of democratic politics. A world where billions, mostly in the global south, live in poverty. A world defined by inequality.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the most pressing crisis of all, arguably, is an absence of collective imagination. It is as if humanity has been afflicted by a psychological complex, in which we believe the present world is stronger than our capacity to remake it \\u2014 as if it were not our ancestors who created what stands before us now. As if the very essence of humanity, if there is such a thing, is not to constantly build new worlds.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If we can move beyond such a failure, we will be able to see something wonderful. The plummeting cost of information and advances in technology are providing the ground for a collective future of freedom and luxury for all. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Automation, robotics and machine learning will, as many august bodies, from the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ft.com/content/3cea8516-8963-11e5-90de-f44762bf9896" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Bank of England</a> to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/white-house-robot-workers_n_56cdd89ce4b0928f5a6de955" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">White House</a>, have predicted, substantially shrink the work force, creating widespread technological unemployment. But that\\u2019s only a problem if you think work \\u2014 as a cashier, driver or construction worker \\u2014 is something to be cherished. For many, work is drudgery. And automation could set us free from it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gene editing and sequencing could revolutionize medical practice, moving it from reactive to predictive. Hereditary diseases could be eliminated, including Huntington\\u2019s disease, cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia, and cancer cured before it reaches Stage 1. Those technologies could allow us to keep pace with the health challenges presented by societal aging \\u2014 by 2020 there will be <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">more people over the age of 60</a> than under the age of 5 \\u2014 and even to surpass them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What\\u2019s more, renewable energy, which has been experiencing steep annual falls in cost for half a century, could meet global energy needs and make possible the vital shift away from fossil fuels. More speculatively, asteroid mining \\u2014 whose technical barriers are presently being surmounted \\u2014 could provide us with not only more energy than we can ever imagine but also more iron, gold, platinum and nickel. Resource scarcity would be a thing of the past.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The consequences are far-reaching and potentially transformative. For the crises that confront our world today \\u2014 technological unemployment, global poverty, societal aging, climate change, resource scarcity \\u2014 we can already glimpse the remedy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there\\u2019s a catch. It\\u2019s called capitalism. It has created the newly emerging abundance, but it is unable to <!-- -->share round<!-- --> the fruits of technological development. A system where things are produced only for profit, capitalism seeks to ration resources to ensure returns. Just like today\\u2019s, companies of the future will form monopolies and seek rents. The result will be imposed scarcity \\u2014 where there\\u2019s not enough food, health care or energy to go around.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So we have to go beyond capitalism. Many will find this suggestion unwholesome. To them, the claim that capitalism will or should end is like saying a triangle doesn\\u2019t have three sides or that the law of gravity no longer applies while an apple falls from a tree. But for a better world, where everyone has the means to a good life on a habitable planet, it is an imperative.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We can see the contours of something new, a society as distinct from our own as that of the 20th century from feudalism, or urban civilization from the life of the hunter-gatherer. It builds on technologies whose development has been accelerating for decades and that only now are set to undermine the key features of what we had previously taken for granted as the natural order of things.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To grasp it, however, will require a new politics. One where technological change serves people, not profit. Where the pursuit of tangible policies \\u2014 rapid decarbonization, full automation and socialized care \\u2014 are preferred to present fantasies. This politics, which is utopian in horizon and everyday in application, has a name: Fully Automated Luxury Communism.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sounds good, doesn\\u2019t it?</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Aaron Bastani (<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/AaronBastani" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">@AaronBastani</a>) is a co-founder of Novara Media and the author of the forthcoming \\u201cFully Automated Luxury Communism: A Manifesto,\\u201d from which this essay is adapted. </p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

It also reported that the number of cruise vessels plying the river more than doubled from 2004 to 2017, to 346 ships with 50,616 beds.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Capt. Branislav Vajda, the president of the Association of Professional Carriers of Serbia, said that crowding on the Danube in and around Belgrade, that country\\u2019s capital, was so severe, \\u201cit is only a matter of time before we have a tragedy of our own to announce.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy found <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1937/05/20/archives/54-hurt-as-budapest-hails-victor-emmanuel-the-citys-first-royal.html?module=inline" title="">when he visited Budapest in 1937</a> and his hosts lit up the majestic Chain Bridge for the first time, the city\\u2019s imperial grandeur is at its most magical at night. And the best vantage point for seeing the sights, from Buda Castle to the monumental Parliament building, is the river.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe government and the oligarchs around the government officials, are always looking for new resources and, in this business, they found one,\\u201d said Mr. Demszky, the former mayor.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said that the current mayor, Istvan Tarlos, an ally of Mr. Orban, was supported by the national government, \\u201cso he is not really free to act.\\u201d Mr. Tarlos declined to respond to a request for an interview.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the days after the accident, according to people familiar with the tourism industry, scores of boats seemed to disappear as the authorities cracked down on those operating without the proper permits. But many said they believed the moves were only temporary.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Orban and his Fidesz party have near complete control over the state and have been exerting increasing influence over the private economy, including tourism, one of the most profitable sectors. Mr. Orban\\u2019s daughter, Rahel Orban, who has a master\\u2019s degree in hospitality management from the private <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ehl.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">\\xc9cole H\\xf4teli\\xe8re de Lausanne</a> in Switzerland, is an unpaid adviser to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://abouthungary.hu/hungarian-tourism-agency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Hungarian Tourism Agency</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2016, Mr. Orban earmarked more than $3 billion in public funds for tourism ventures across Hungary up to 2030, including a $1 billion resort complex near Lake Balaton. Ms. Orban\\u2019s husband, Istvan Tiborcz, has come under criticism for his stake in the development. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/hungary-orban-balaton/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">A Reuters investigation published in 2018</a> found that Mr. Tiborcz \\u201cstands to collect almost half of any profits from a venture which acquired the resort\\u2019s biggest hotel.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Hungarian Tourism Agency, which manages all tourism-related projects, including those funded by the European Union, is overseen by the Prime Minister\\u2019s Office and co-owns the slips for international ships along the Budapest stretch of the Danube.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe authorities should examine whether business considerations unduly overruled expert opinions that the increased hotel boat traffic on the Danube River in Budapest may cause serious accidents,\\u201d said Miklos Ligeti, legal director for the public information advocacy group <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://transparency.hu/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Transparency International</a> in Hungary. \\u201cIf this can be established, there is a serious indication of gross negligence which should be prosecuted.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials from Viking Cruises declined to answer questions about overcrowding on the river, but industry officials noted that river cruise ships remain among the safest modes of travel, with a record better even than the airline industry.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Zsolt Varga, head of the Hungarian Federation of Passenger Fleet Operators, said he did not believe that the recent tragedy was the result of overcrowding.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThose two boats could have been the only boats on the Danube at that time and this still could have happened,\\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, he acknowledged that there was concern about coordination between local boats and the larger cruise ships. That is why, he said, a new rule was instituted last year requiring ships doing a sightseeing loop in Budapest to travel past the Arpad Bridge in the north and Rakoczi Bridge in the south before making turns.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">David Szekeres, a 47-year-old boat captain who trains skippers with his Gabriella Sailing company, said navigating around Budapest presented specific challenges, including jetties unmarked on maps and navigation markers in the wrong places. Within the city, the Danube rises and falls as much as eight meters \\u2014 more than in other cities, where dams and levees regulate the flow. When the river is running high and fast, it carries all sorts of debris, and leaves little room for error passing under bridges.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not all those at the helm are up to the task, Mr. Szekeres said, in part because the licensing process has been weakened.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For instance, he said that the test for a pilot license for boats under 20 feet changed in 2013, when a former government official took over a company that trained pilots for the written part of the exam.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to learn anything about sailing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou just have to learn the exact answers to pass the test.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was near the Margaret Bridge that the accident took place.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the Viking ship bore down on the Mermaid from behind, investigators said, there was no radio communication between them. No warning horn was sounded.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The inquiry has been hampered by treacherous currents and poor underwater visibility. The Viking ship left Budapest for Passau, Germany, less than two days after the fatal collision.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gyorgy Magyar, a Hungarian lawyer representing the family of the Hungarian crewman aboard the Mermaid, said it was wrong for the authorities to allow the Viking to depart from Budapest so soon after the accident.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThat vessel was involved in an accident and it is evidence that shouldn\\u2019t be released until the professional and all-encompassing investigation has concluded,\\u201d he said. Letting it leave means \\u201cthe evidence has been tampered with,\\u201d he added.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some clues as to the cause of the crash might be revealed now that the Mermaid has been recovered from the riverbed. But whatever investigators find, it will not change what people who know the Danube have long said is the basic problem.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cFor me, it is overcrowded,\\u201d Mr. Szekeres said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cAnd now, you have these really big cruise ships doing sightseeing tours, and they are just too big,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThey should not be doing this. Especially at night.\\u201d</p>]]'

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the last month there have been two big profiles, one in this newspaper and one in Washingtonian, of young men who were radicalized into some version of the alt-right and then later abjured far-right politics.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2019/05/05/what-happened-after-my-13-year-old-son-joined-the-alt-right/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Washingtonian profile</a> is a mother\\u2019s first-person account of watching her 13-year-old son join an extremist internet community and then find his way back out. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html?module=inline" title="">The Times profile</a>, by my colleague Kevin Roose, follows a 20-something college dropout who has turned to progressive politics after a sojourn as a <!-- -->\\u201ctradcon.\\u201d<!-- --> Both pieces locate their subjects in a larger sociology, but both are especially concerned with the role of YouTube in accelerating radicalization, and in particular with the way its algorithm, intended to reward videos that prompt intense engagement, is creating a pathway into extremist content by rewarding provocation and letting content purveyors essentially monetize the rabbit hole.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since I might be described (even in the comment thread below this column, who knows?) as some sort of \\u201ctradcon\\u201d myself, I have some doubts about categorizations that purport to define the moment when respectable conservatism becomes dangerous extremism. Nonetheless I agree with several of the profiles\\u2019 anti-YouTube premises: Education-by-algorithm is a bad idea; Silicon Valley has monetized amoral slippery slopes in all kinds of arenas (with pedophilia being the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/world/americas/youtube-pedophiles.html?module=inline" title="">latest grim example</a>); and the stew of racism and conspiracy theory at the far-right edges of social media is an example of where one such slope can lead.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That said, the profiles are rich enough to illustrate a complexity that can\\u2019t just be reduced to algorithms run amok. When it comes to explaining the phenomenon of right-wing populism, liberals are likely to argue both that the populist era has exposed a darkness always present at the heart of conservative politics and that a toxic, post-truth new-media ecosystem has greased the skids for President Trump, Brexit and the rest. In the case of white-identitarian media personalities popular on YouTube, the two arguments converge.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in the profiles you can also see clear illustrations of two arguments that a certain kind of conservative \\u2014 the kind who locate their politics somewhere between the Trumpians and the Resistance \\u2014 is likely to offer in response to liberalism\\u2019s explanations. First, that populism is a reaction to the breakdown of community outside the liberal metropole, a breakdown that the fiscally conservative-socially liberal \\u201ccentrism\\u201d of our leaders has worsened or left unaddressed. And second, that far-right personalities attract people by offering an escape from the airlessness of liberalism, a chance to rebel against its <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/opinion/campaign-stops/clintons-samantha-bee-problem.html?module=inline" title="">cultural hegemony</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/opinion/sunday/how-liberalism-loses.html?module=inline" title="">increasing ideological conformism</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Caleb Cain, Roose\\u2019s subject, illustrates the first argument, to the extent that he seems like a character from the pages of Charles Murray\\u2019s \\u201cComing Apart\\u201d or Tim Carney\\u2019s \\u201cAlienated America\\u201d or J.D. Vance\\u2019s \\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\\u201d to cite just the most prominent right-leaning authors who have written about lower-middle-class decay:</p>, <p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">The internet was an escape. Mr. Cain grew up in postindustrial Appalachia and was raised by his conservative Christian grandparents. He was smart, but shy and socially awkward, and he carved out an identity during high school as a countercultural punk. He went to community college, but dropped out after three semesters.</p>, <p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">Broke and depressed, he resolved to get his act together. He began looking for help in the same place he looked for everything: YouTube.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In other words, a story about the internet is also a story about the attenuation of non-online forms of community, about fatherlessness and family breakdown, about the travails of the \\u201csome college\\u201d demographic, about the social crisis of coal country and the Rust Belt. And it\\u2019s therefore an example of why attempts to wall off explanations for populism into mutually exclusive \\u201ceconomic anxiety\\u201d and \\u201cracism\\u201d categories are so futile: There is an <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">integrated</em> relationship between socioeconomic conditions in downscale America and the appeal of redpilled YouTube, between changing personal and material conditions and the appeal of virtual white-identitarian \\u201ccommunity.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There is also an integrated relationship between how elite liberalism has evolved and the kind of reactions it provokes. Here is the opening act, from the Washingtonian profile, of the suburban-D.C. episode that sent its 13-year-old subject into the online wilds in search of support and solidarity:</p>, <p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">One morning during first period, a male friend of Sam\\u2019s mentioned a meme whose suggestive name was an inside joke between the two of them. Sam laughed. A girl at the table overheard their private conversation, misconstrued it as a sexual reference, and reported it as sexual harassment. Sam\\u2019s guidance counselor pulled him out of his next class and accused him of \\u201cbreaking the law.\\u201d Before long, he was in the office of a male administrator who informed him that the exchange was \\u201cillegal,\\u201d hinted that the police were coming, and delivered him into the custody of the school\\u2019s resource officer. At the administrator\\u2019s instruction, that man ushered Sam into an empty room, handed him a blank sheet of paper, and instructed him to write a \\u201cstatement of guilt.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">No one called me as this unfolded, even though Sam cried for about six hours straight as staff members parked him in vacant offices to keep him away from other students. When he stepped off the bus that afternoon and I asked why his eyes were so swollen, he informed me that he would probably be suspended, but possibly also expelled and arrested.</p>, <p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">\\u2026 In an out-of-body moment, I imagined that this very episode would be cited by some future cultural critic on the limits of liberalism \\u2026</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And yes, perhaps too predictably, here I am citing it \\u2014 as a particularly vivid example, from inside the D.C. bubble, of how progressivism fosters alienation and potential rebellion long before any sinister Silicon Valley algorithms get involved. And, going further, as an example of how the alt-right\\u2019s promise of \\u201csecret knowledge\\u201d about gender, race and sexuality finds a ready audience among young people primed by aspects of their own progressive education to suspect that the system is enforcing ideology rather than imparting truth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Which, let me stress again, doesn\\u2019t mean that the far-right YouTubers are actually good or the algorithms actually benign. Nor does it mean that conservatives reacting to liberal critiques of YouTube should automatically leap to the defense of either \\u2014 on the assumption that as goes the YouTube success of Stefan Molyneux, so goes the non-racist right.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, it\\u2019s understandable for conservatives to worry that if Silicon Valley censors the likes of Molyneux, it will end up censoring them. It\\u2019s sensible for them to join parts in the left in worrying about the concentrated power over information that the stewards of social-media platforms enjoy. And it\\u2019s necessary for them to recognize that the influence of redpillers and white-identitarians reflects their own failure, across the decades of movement-conservative institution building, to create something that seems more compelling to fugitives from liberalism than the Spirit of the Reddit Thread.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With all that said, though, a humane conservatism should still be able to thrive in a world where white nationalists have trouble monetizing their extremism, in which YouTube algorithms are built to maximize something other than addiction. And the endpoint of both the Times and Washingtonian profiles, in which personal contact with real-life alt-righters and counterarguments from online left-wingers suffice to pull the main characters away from the far right, suggests that the current Very Online alternative to liberalism is not necessarily built to last.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But if conservatives would be unwise to commit themselves to the defense of some inalienable right to sell crackpottery on YouTube, liberals would be equally unwise to focus so intently on the algorithm, and to pour so much energy into pressuring Silicon Valley to build a better, more progressive way of steering their readers through the information sea.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Whatever role the structure of the internet plays in radicalization, the root causes are still primarily sociological and political, and they will perdure and manifest themselves somewhere, somehow, no matter what YouTube suggests for your next video when you watch a Milton Friedman lecture.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Moreover, there is no better example of the technocratic spirit\\u2019s moral idiocy than the idea that, with a social crisis in the hinterland and ideological calcification at the heart of educated power, what we need is a better <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">algorithm</em> to prevent people \\u2014 young men, especially \\u2014 from getting too restless or rebellious or extreme.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The healing of the body politic will not be accomplished with such fiddling. There may be left-wing or liberal solutions to our deeper problems. But an elite that tries to manage them away with more enlightened media curation deserves to inherit nothing but the wind.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

Brian said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve never been on television before, so it was definitely a new experience. I tried to pretend that the camera was not there, and just act naturally.

For decades, their value slowly climbed. Then, between 2002 and 2014, the price skyrocketed \\u2014 from $200,000 dollars to $1.2 million.

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We\\u2019re living in the middle of a religious revival; it\\u2019s just that the movements that are rising are not what we normally call \\u201creligion.\\u201d The first rising movement is astrology. According to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/01/new-age-beliefs-common-among-both-religious-and-nonreligious-americans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">2018 Pew poll</a>, 29 percent of Americans say they believe in astrology. That\\u2019s more than are members of mainline Protestant churches.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This surge in belief is primarily among the young. According to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2018/nsb20181/assets/404/science-and-technology-public-attitudes-and-understanding_atables.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">National Science Foundation survey</a>, 44 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds say that astrology is somewhat or very \\u201cscientific.\\u201d Unsurprisingly, online horoscope sites are booming. Stella Bugbee, editor of The Cut, told <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/01/the-new-age-of-astrology/550034/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Atlantic</a> that in 2017 the typical horoscope got 150 percent more traffic than it had the year before.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another surging spiritual movement is witchcraft. In 1990, only 8,000 Americans self-identified as Wiccans. Ten years later there were 134,000, and today, along with other neo-pagans, there are over a million. As Tara Isabella Burton put it in an excellent, deeply researched <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.the-american-interest.com/2019/06/07/the-rise-of-progressive-occultism/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">essay</a> in The American Interest, \\u201cWicca, by that estimation, is technically the fastest-growing religion in America.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The third great rising spiritual force is mindfulness, which seems to be everywhere. The fourth is wokeness, what some have called the Great Awokening. Burton\\u2019s essay is really about how astrology and witchcraft have become important spiritual vocabularies within parts of the social justice movement. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In March, she wrote, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shared her birth time with the astrologer Arthur Lipp-Bonewits, who then shared her birth chart with the world, creating an online sensation. \\u201cAOC\\u2019s Aries Moon indicates that she\\u2019s emotionally fed by a certain amount of independence, self-determination, and spontaneity,\\u201d Jeanna Kadlec <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.allure.com/story/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-astrology-birth-chart-reading" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">wrote</a> in Allure.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the Kavanaugh hearings, 13,000 \\u201cresistance witches\\u201d cast a hex on Brett Kavanaugh. There is now a plethora of guidebooks for how to use astrology and witchcraft to advance left-wing causes. They have names like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.llewellyn.com/product.php?ean=9780738759968" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">\\u201cMagic for Resistance: Rituals and Spells for Change\\u201d</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://revelore.press/product/the-new-aradia-a-witchs-handbook-to-magical-resistance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">\\u201cThe New Aradia: A Witch\\u2019s Handbook to Magical Resistance.\\u201d</a> </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These surging movements are people\\u2019s attempts to solve the major needs of the current moment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first need is simply to find a way to be spiritual. People are always saying we live in a more secular age, but secularism never really comes. Humans are transcendent creatures who have spiritual experiences and instinctively appeal to supernatural powers. Even in the most secular parts of society, there is great and unfulfilled spiritual yearning.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Second, there is a widespread need to slow down, to escape the pace of life technology wants and to live at a human pace.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Third, there is a widespread need to express alienation. Interest in the occult rises during periods of transition and disillusion. It happened in the late 1960s, and it\\u2019s happening today. For many, the traditional organized religions are implicated in the existing power structures. Being occult is a way to announce that you stand on the fringe of society, that you stand against the patriarchy, against the heteronormative culture and against the structures of oppression. Political alienation manifests itself in the alt-right and the energized radical left. It makes sense that it would manifest itself in the spiritual realm, too.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fourth is the need for identity markers. We live at a time when many of the traditional sources of identity (ethnicity, rooted neighborhood) are being erased. Astrology tells you who you are and what traits you have. In a highly diverse society, it also tells you what sort of people you\\u2019re likely to be compatible and incompatible with. When I hear people talk about astrology, this is how they are<!-- --> using it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fifth is the desire to live within a coherent creed and community, but without having that creed impinge on your individual autonomy. Being an Orthodox Jew is a thick but binding life. The emerging spirituality is a hodgepodge spirituality. Each person borrows practices from, say, Native American, Buddhist, Christian, Jewish and SoulCycle traditions and blends them in a way he or she finds moving. There is no grand narrative, no specific way one is expected to live, no <!-- -->set of laws you have to obey or even a<!-- --> specific cult leader who might boss you around. Religion bows before individualism.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finally, many people seem to want to be alternative without actually leaving the mainstream world. The people I know who talk about astrology sort of believe it, but they sort of don\\u2019t. Their attitude is ironical, attached and detached all at once.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even the occultists are not really that countercultural. For example, David Salisbury\\u2019s book <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://redwheelweiser.com/detail.html?id=9781578636570" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">\\u201cWitchcraft Activism: A Toolkit for Magical Resistance\\u201d</a> is surprisingly normal. Salisbury gives standard advice on how to be an activist. It\\u2019s just that he asks you to say a prayer to Hermes, the messenger god, when you send an important email.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I doubt that much of this will be sustainable. I doubt it\\u2019s possible to have tight community and also total autonomy, that it\\u2019s possible to detach spiritual practices from the larger narratives and cultures and still have something life-shaping. But society is groaning. New forms are coming into being. We really are living through a moment of major transitional change.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Within a half-mile radius in downtown Manhattan, there are five matcha stores: MatchaBar, Matchaful, Cha Cha Matcha, the other Cha Cha Matcha and Matcha n\\u2019 More, which are each less than five minutes apart on foot. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Matcha, a kind of powdered green tea used in Japanese tea ceremonies, has become a popular drink in the wellness scene for its grassy green color and antioxidants. High-end cafes in SoHo like Matchaful blend it with nut milks or spices and sell it for $7, more than the cost of a latte.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the same time, places that once catered to health-minded New Yorkers before wellness became a buzzword \\u2014 spots like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/dining/souen-nyc-closing.html?module=inline" title="">Souen</a>, Integral Yoga Natural Foods and Angelica Kitchen \\u2014 are closing. All three opened in the 1970s, when SoHo was home to an artistic and creative community.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the 1960s and \\u201970s, the neighborhood was a magnet for artists. Then came fancy shops and French restaurants. Most young artists haven\\u2019t been able to afford to live or maintain studios there for the last couple of decades.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Instead there is By Chloe, a vegan fast food restaurant, which sells a quinoa taco salad for $12.45; Brodo, which sells cups of bone broth for $10; the Good Market, which sells pineapple raspberry kombucha organic slushies for $4.50; Welleco and the Nue Co, both supplement stores; the Hemp Garden, where CBD sheet masks sell for $29.99; the Detox Market, where the Vintner\\u2019s Daughter Active Treatment Essence face oil is $225; Lululemon and Nike; boutique fitness establishments like Y-7 Studio, New York Pilates (three locations), SLT and SoulCycle, where classes are upward of $30.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In early April, Kind, the snack food company, organized a two-day pop-up highlighting its \\u201cSweeteners Uncovered\\u201d campaign, which shows hidden sugars in popular snack foods.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This took the form of a high-tech bodega at 579 Broadway, a space that once housed an Aldo shoe store and whose rent for the space Kind declined to share. At the pop-up, the sugar content from Kind\\u2019s competitors could be revealed by scanning a QR code. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of the few dozen people there bypassed the nutritional information to stuff free plastic fanny packs with free Kind Bars. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company hosted a pop-up in Times Square two years ago, but Jenna <!-- -->Keplesky<!-- -->, who works in Kind\\u2019s communications department, lobbied to move this one to SoHo. \\u201cI was encouraging locations that were more cost effective, but Jenna wanted the right brand message,\\u201d said Daniel Lubetzky, the chief executive of Kind. \\u201cI do think there\\u2019s a sense that SoHo is more representative and ahead of the curve in health and wellness in New York City.\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The neighborhood is also known to have a steady stream of foot traffic from New Yorkers and tourists alike, Ms. Keplesky said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In many cases, fanciful and high-concept pop-ups have followed wellness retailers to SoHo and its surrounding streets.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Blume, which sells self-care and menstrual products marketed to young women and teenagers, had a pop-up at <!-- -->224 Mulberry Street<!-- --> in NoLIta in February that included a slumber party and panel discussion. The founders, Taran and Bunny Ghatrora, wrote in an email that they chose the location because it is one of their favorite neighborhoods and that a large portion of their New York community is based there.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The condom company Sustain Natural hosted the Get on Top Pop-Up in April 2018 at 208 Bowery, with neon vulva art installations and tampon-filled bathtubs leading into a back event space called the womb. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Meika Hollender, its chief executive, said that foot traffic and a neighborhood affinity for wellness made her choose the Bowery: \\u201cThere are so many like-minded wellness studios and brands showcasing their products in this area that it felt like a natural opportunity to reach consumers in a fun and accessible way. I mean, who wouldn\\u2019t be curious walking past a vagina-themed pop-up.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buffy, which makes comforters out of recycled plastic bottles and eucalyptus plants, had a \\u201cphysical touch-point\\u201d called Soft-Space at 150 Wooster Street (where, last year, a penthouse sold for $32.6 million) during the 2018 holiday season. According to a news release for the company, inspiration came from Buckminster Fuller and the hippie modernist movement of the 1960s and \\u201970s.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Clean Market, a store on 54th Street and Second Avenue that sells natural beauty products and services like vitamin IV drips, has a pop-up in NoLIta at Project by Equinox on <!-- -->Mulberry Street<!-- -->. \\u201cWe want the downtown crowd to get to know us,\\u201d said the founder Lily Kunin one afternoon as she sent an associate on an errand a few blocks north to the Farmer\\u2019s Dog pop-up at Showfields at 11 Bond Street. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Currently Showfields has pop-ups decorated with potted plants and pink velveteen chairs from the Australian skin care brand Frank Body and Quip, a dental company that frequently advertises on podcasts. <!-- -->The<!-- --> cafe, called Coffee \\u2019n Clothes, sells miniature cupcakes and lattes emblazoned with the logos of fashion brands. (Showfields, which calls itself \\u201cthe Most Interesting Store in the World,\\u201d occupies a 1913 NoHo building that, before its purchase in 2015 by FRF Realty for $26 million, housed a 43-bed women\\u2019s shelter.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the fact that the <!-- -->store<!-- --> was virtually empty on a recent Monday afternoon, some tenants, who pay a flat fee for space, are pleased with early results. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWhat we\\u2019ve managed to do in sales in three weeks was greater in total than one of our retail partners who has 13 or 14 doors nationwide,\\u201d said Jasmina Aganovic, the founder of Mother Dirt, a skin care line in Boston that has a second-floor space at Showfields. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a sexy location in New York City, and we have a large concentration of customers in New York and Brooklyn in particular.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Large companies have used wellness businesses as destinations for their own events. OtterBox introduced its Otter &amp; Pop phone cases to press at Chillhouse, a cafe, nail salon and massage studio on the neighboring Lower East Side. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Landlords are enthusiastic about wellness-related tenants, according to Paul Wexler, the head of Wexler Healthcare Properties at the Corcoran Group. \\u201cLandlords are generally encouraged by it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a way to fill retail spaces, and an amenity to their buildings. There are spaces we\\u2019re marketing with that in mind.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some smaller wellness businesses are looking to spread brand awareness if they could only find the right space. Justine Monsul, the founder of Monfefo, a beverage company that makes organic pressed ginger and turmeric shots, has been looking for a pop-up storefront. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cTrying to find a place in New York is like winning the lottery,\\u201d she said on the phone during a trip to Israel. \\u201cI want to share my story and have more of a relationship to my customers. You don\\u2019t just want a store, you want an experience. You want some palo santo burning.\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Colette Dong, the co-founder and C.E.O. of the Ness, opened a pop-up trampoline workout studio in nearby TriBeCa in a location that was a Bikram yoga studio. The pop-up lease was \\u201ca way to get our feet wet without getting locked into a five- or 10-year lease term and test the demand for it,\\u201d Ms. Dong said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWill we even have studios in five years?\\u201d Ms. Dong said. \\u201cWill there be studios to do our online streaming workouts? Will we be working out with robots?\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Maybe best not to commit to anything too long-term.</p>]]'

It impedes early diagnoses, the monitoring of children, pregnancies and the continuation of treatments that were already underway.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During his campaign for the presidency, Mr. Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist, committed to making major changes to the Mais M\\xe9dicos program, an initiative begun in 2013 when a leftist government was in power. The program sent doctors into Brazil\\u2019s small towns, indigenous villages and violent, low-income urban neighborhoods.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About half of the Mais M\\xe9dicos doctors were from Cuba, and they were deployed to 34 remote indigenous villages and the poorer quarters of more than 4,000 towns and cities, places that established Brazilian physicians largely shun.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe willingness of Cuban doctors to work in difficult conditions became a cornerstone of the public health system,\\u201d said Ms. Bahia, the professor.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Brazil paid millions of dollars a month to Cuba for the doctors, making them <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/world/americas/venezuela-cuban-doctors.html?module=inline" title="">a vital export for the island\\u2019s coffers</a>. But most of the money went directly to Cuba\\u2019s Communist government, an arrangement Mr. Bolsonaro warned he would change.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cuban doctors <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/world/americas/brazil-cuban-doctors-revolt.html?module=inline" title="">have long complained about getting only a small cut</a> of the money for their work, and Mr. Bolsonaro said they would have to be allowed to keep their entire salaries and to bring their families with them to Brazil. They would also have to pass equivalency exams to prove their qualifications.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cOur Cuban brothers will be freed,\\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro said in an official campaign proposal presented to electoral authorities. \\u201cTheir families will be allowed to migrate to Brazil. And, if they pass the revalidation, they will begin to receive the entire amount that was being robbed by the Cuban dictators!\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two weeks after Mr. Bolsonaro <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election.html?module=inline" title="">won the presidency in October</a>, Cuba ordered all its doctors out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Access to free health care is a right under Brazilian law, and Mais M\\xe9dicos was enacted in 2013 by President Dilma Rousseff in a bid to provide medical care to communities that were not being served by the public health system. Through a network of free clinics, the program provided 60 million Brazilians with access to a family doctor in their community for the first time.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the first four years of Mais M\\xe9dicos, the percentage of Brazilians receiving primary care rose to 70 percent from 59.6 percent, according to<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.paho.org/bra/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5809:opas-lanca-relatorio-30-anos-de-sus-que-sus-para-2030-e-destaca-importancia-de-atencao-primaria-e-mais-medicos&amp;Itemid=843" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> a report</a> by the Pan-American Health Organization, which coordinated Cuba\\u2019s participation in the program.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The withdrawal of Cuban doctors could reverse that trend, with the consequences especially severe for those under 5, potentially leading to the deaths of up to 37,000 young children by 2030, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.terra.com.br/vida-e-estilo/saude/saida-de-cubanos-pode-levar-a-aumento-de-37-mil-mortes-diz-opas,c9da3a2fd30f623b7f4a90f607913279de24ust3.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">warned Dr. Gabriel Vivas</a>, an official with the Pan-American Health Organization.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In February, it looked as if Mr. Bolsonaro would fulfill his promise: the national Health Ministry announced that all of the positions left vacant by Cuba\\u2019s withdrawal had been filled with Brazilian doctors. But by April, thousands of the new recruits had either quit or failed to show up for work in the first place.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More than 2,000 Cuban doctors have chosen to remain in Brazil, defying the call to return home. But with the special arrangement with Cuba terminated, they are now ineligible to practice medicine until they pass an exam \\u2014 which the Brazilian government has not offered since 2017 and for which the Health Ministry has set no date.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Luiz Henrique Mandetta, Brazil\\u2019s health minister, said the new government was working on a bill to ensure the goals of Mais M\\xe9dicos were achieved and the doctors replaced.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cEven if the program has various problems, it has a positive side, which is, precisely, diminishing the inequality in health care neglect,\\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Mr. Mandetta initially said the bill would be sent to Congress between April and May. Now, the ministry says it will be introduced by the end of June.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Karel S\\xe1nchez was one of four Cuban doctors sent to the remote region of Cachoeira do Arari in the Brazilian Amazon. He waited there for five months after his government ordered the withdrawal of all Cuban doctors, with the expectation that Mr. Bolsonaro would respect his campaign pledge to provide an exam so he could continue to work and receive his full salary.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI was happy when Bolsonaro said he wouldn\\u2019t support a dictatorship,\\u201d Dr. S\\xe1nchez said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In April, Dr. S\\xe1nchez gave up and moved to S\\xe3o Paulo, where he scrapes together money by selling homemade sweets and working as a baggage handler at an airport.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cNow he doesn\\u2019t talk about us at all, just silence,\\u201d Dr. S\\xe1nchez said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Embu-Gua\\xe7u, Dr. Santa Cobas, the Cuban doctor who had been serving residents at the clinic now only open on Thursdays, was still nearby and eager to work.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Dr. Cobas is unemployed, and the 4,000 people she once cared for don\\u2019t have access to a local doctor six days a week.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cNow we end up doing triage all day \\u2014 deciding who needs to rush to another hospital, who gets to see the visiting doctor on Thursday and who will just have to wait,\\u201d said Erica Toledo, the head nurse at the clinic, Jardim Campestre, which was opened in 2015.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cDr. Santa was here from the first day, and it was the first time people felt taken care of by their \\u2018own\\u2019 doctor,\\u201d Ms. Toledo said. \\u201cThey really love her.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The health secretary of Embu-Gua\\xe7u, Dr. Maria Dalva, said she was frustrated that 63 percent of the city had voted for Mr. Bolsonaro, despite his overt antipathy for Mais M\\xe9dicos.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe child mortality rate here dropped to 7 percent from 17 percent in five years thanks to Mais M\\xe9dicos,\\u201d said Dr. Dalva. \\u201cI told people to think about that before they voted.\\u201d</p>]]'

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The events of the past few weeks destroyed whatever credibility Donald Trump may still have had on economic policy. And investors are celebrating. At this point, evidence that Trump tweets are sound and fury signifying nothing is, in effect, good news.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Let\\u2019s review what happened. First, having gone to great lengths to get a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada \\u2014 an agreement that was very similar to the existing agreement, but one he could slap his own name on \\u2014 Trump basically blew up his position by threatening to impose new tariffs unless Mexico did something about border issues that have nothing to do with trade.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This obviously weakens if it doesn\\u2019t destroy Trump\\u2019s ability to negotiate future agreements, on trade or anything else. After all, what\\u2019s the point of making deals with an administration that reneges on its promises whenever it feels like it?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But then, barely a week later, Trump called the whole thing off in return for a statement by Mexico that it would do \\u2026 things it had already agreed to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fmaggie-haberman&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">months earlier</a>. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We don\\u2019t know exactly what caused Trump to back down, but a good guess is that the warnings of U.S. manufacturers \\u2014 horrified at the possibility that Trump\\u2019s tariff tantrum would disrupt their supply chains \\u2014 finally made it through to the Oval Office, or the golf course, or wherever he was when they finally got his ear.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/paul-krugman?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[For an even deeper look at what\\u2019s on Paul Krugman\\u2019s mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]</em></a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, not having a destructive trade war is a good thing. But what the world learned from this climbdown is that Trump\\u2019s threats are as empty as his promises.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An aside: Recent events have surely reduced the chances that Congress will ever approve the U.S.M.C.A., the Trump-negotiated replacement for Nafta.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Democrats in the House were already reluctant to pass enabling legislation, giving Trump something to boast about, unless they got some serious concessions on issues that matter to them, like labor rights. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump\\u2019s counter was a threat to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/us/politics/trump-withdraw-nafta.html?module=inline" title="">withdraw from Nafta</a> with no replacement. But this would have catastrophic economic effects, leading into an election year. After last week\\u2019s climbdown, who believes that he would carry through on that threat?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump was, of course, unhappy at news reports that accurately described his deal with Mexico over migrants as the nothingburger (nothingtaco?) it actually was. So in addition to lashing out at \\u201cfake news,\\u201d he introduced a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-08/mexico-never-agreed-to-farm-deal-with-u-s-contradicting-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">whole new claim</a>: \\u201cMEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There were a few peculiar things about that claim, despite the extra persuasiveness that always comes when YOU MAKE YOUR ASSERTIONS IN CAPITAL LETTERS. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like many Trump tweets, it reads like a clumsy translation from the original Russian (\\u201cgreat patriot farmers\\u201d?). More to the point, there was nothing at all about agriculture in the official agreement. And at the most basic level, that\\u2019s just not something the Mexican government could deliver, even if it wanted to.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some readers may recall that a few months ago China tried to avert trade conflict by promising to buy 10 million tons of U.S. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-23/china-s-pledge-for-u-s-soy-buying-catches-traders-off-guard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">soybeans</a>. The ploy didn\\u2019t work, but it was at least feasible: State-owned enterprises make up a large part of the Chinese economy, and Beijing can just order them to buy stuff. Mexico, however, is a market economy, in which the private sector, not the government, decides how much Iowa corn to import.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So was Trump confusing Mexico with China? Did he forget that the China deal he was touting months ago actually fell through? Who knows? </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What\\u2019s clear, however, is that on trade policy \\u2014 his signature issue \\u2014 the president of the United States is seriously out to lunch. And you might think that this would worry investors.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as I said, markets appear to be celebrating: As I write this, stock markets are up, while long-term interest rates \\u2014 a better barometer of investor views about economic prospects \\u2014 are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-08/donald-trump-unleashed-animal-spirits-and-then-he-crushed-them" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">off their recent lows</a>. What\\u2019s going on?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The answer, I\\u2019d suggest, is that financial markets are basically discounting Trump\\u2019s rants; they\\u2019ve stopped treating evidence of his unfitness for office as news. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes, he\\u2019s deeply ignorant about policy. Yes, his rage-tweets constantly remind us of his egomania and insecurity. But we\\u2019ve known all that for a while; Trump\\u2019s personality is, in effect, already priced in.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What investors want to know instead is the extent to which his character flaws will actually lead to destructive economic policy. Legally, Trump faces remarkably few constraints: U.S. trade law gives the president enormous discretion to impose tariffs at will, and given a spineless Senate, there are a lot of other things he can do in the name of national security. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as of right now, markets appear to be betting that he tweets loudly but carries a small stick.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Is this a good bet? I have my doubts. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The trade war with China still seems to be on, and Europe may be next. More generally, when you have an attention-seeking president, ignoring his antics could well provoke him into even more extreme behavior. But for now, investors are effectively treating Trump as crazy but harmless.

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fire that swept across the backlot of Universal Studios Hollywood on Sunday, June 1, 2008, began early that morning, in New England. At 4:43 a.m., a security guard at the movie studio and theme park saw flames rising from a rooftop on the set known as New England Street, a stretch of quaint Colonial-style buildings where small-town scenes were filmed for motion pictures and television shows. That night, maintenance workers had repaired the roof of a building on the set, using blowtorches to heat asphalt shingles. They finished the job at 3 a.m. and, following protocol, kept watch over the site for another hour to ensure that the shingles had cooled. But the roof remained hot, and some 40 minutes after the workers left, one of the hot spots flared up.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fire moved quickly. It engulfed the backlot\\u2019s famous New York City streetscape. It burned two sides of Courthouse Square, a set featured in \\u201cBack to the Future.\\u201d It spread south to a cavernous shed housing the King Kong Encounter, an animatronic attraction for theme-park visitors. Hundreds of firefighters responded, including Universal Studios\\u2019 on-site brigade. But the fire crews were hindered by low water pressure and damaged sprinkler systems and by intense radiant heat gusting between combustible structures.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Eventually the flames reached a 22,320-square-foot warehouse that sat near the King Kong Encounter. The warehouse was nondescript, a hulking edifice of corrugated metal, but it was one of the most important buildings on the 400-acre lot. Its official name was Building 6197. To backlot workers, it was known as the video vault.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shortly after the fire broke out, a 50-year-old man named Randy Aronson was awakened by a ringing phone at his home in Canyon Country, Calif., about 30 miles north of Universal City, the unincorporated area of the San Fernando Valley where the studio sits. Aronson had worked on the Universal lot for 25 years. His title was senior director of vault operations at Universal Music Group (UMG). In practice, this meant he spent his days overseeing an archive housed in the video vault. The term \\u201cvideo vault\\u201d was in fact a misnomer, or a partial misnomer. About two-thirds of the building was used to store videotapes and film reels, a library controlled by Universal Studios\\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal. But Aronson\\u2019s domain was a separate space, a fenced-off area of 2,400 square feet in the southwest corner of the building, lined with 18-foot-high storage shelves. It was a sound-recordings library, the repository of some of the most historically significant material owned by UMG, the world\\u2019s largest record company.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Aronson let the phone call go to voice mail, but when he listened to the message, he heard sirens screaming in the background and the frantic voice of a colleague: \\u201cThe vault is on fire.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Musicians </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/universal-music-fire-musician-reactions.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">mourned the fiery destruction</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> of their recordings.]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Aronson dressed and steered his car to Interstate 5. A few minutes later, the air picked up a harsh scent: the acrid odor of the fire, riding the early-morning breeze into Santa Clarita, roughly 20 miles from the backlot. Aronson sped south. When he turned onto the Hollywood Freeway, he saw clouds of greenish-black smoke pouring into the sky. It was 5:45 a.m. when he gained access to the lot and made his way to the vault.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There, he found an inferno. Fire was blasting out of the building as if shot from giant flamethrowers. The heat was extraordinary. There were at least a dozen fire engines ringing the vault, and as Aronson looked around he noticed one truck whose parking lights seemed to be melting.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The vault lay near Park Lake, a man-made body of water that appeared in the classic B-movie \\u201cCreature From the Black Lagoon.\\u201d Fire crews began drafting water from the lake. They rained water from the tops of ladders; they doused the building with foam fire retardant. These efforts proved futile. \\u201cIt was like watching molten lava move through the building,\\u201d Aronson remembers. \\u201cJust a huge blob of fire that flowed and flowed.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before long, firefighters switched tactics, using bulldozers to knock down the burning warehouse and clear away barriers to extinguishing the fire, including the remains of the UMG archive: rows of metal shelving and reels of tape, reduced to heaps of ash and twisted steel. Heavy machinery was still at work dismantling the building as night fell. The job was finished in the early morning of June 2, nearly 24 hours after the first flames appeared.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fire made news around the world, and the destruction of the video vault featured prominently in the coverage. But nearly all news outlets characterized the vault fire as a close call, in which worst cases were averted. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/01/us/01cnd-fire.html?module=inline" title="">The New York Times reported</a> that \\u201ca vault full of video and television images\\u201d had burned up, but added that \\u201cin no case was the destroyed material the only copy of a work,\\u201d a claim attributed to Universal Studios officials. Subsequent articles focused on the fire\\u2019s impact on film festivals, which relied on prints from Universal\\u2019s library. But journalists moved on from the story, and there has never been a full accounting of film and video losses in the fire.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Times\\u2019s report was typical in another way: It contained no mention of a music archive in the devastated warehouse. The confusion was understandable. Universal Studios Hollywood was a movie backlot, not a record-company headquarters. What\\u2019s more, a series of mergers and acquisitions had largely severed the ties between Universal\\u2019s film and music businesses. In 2004, Universal Studios was purchased by General Electric and merged with G.E.\\u2019s television property, NBC, to become NBCUniversal; UMG was cast under separate management, and in 2006 fell wholly under the ownership of Vivendi, the French media conglomerate. When the fire struck in June 2008, UMG was a rent-paying tenant on NBC Universal\\u2019s lot.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of the few journalists to note the existence of the UMG archive was Nikki Finke, the entertainment-industry blogger and gadfly. In <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://deadline.com/2008/06/update-universal-fire-burns-music-history-5937/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a Deadline.com post</a> on the day of the fire, Finke wrote that \\u201c1,000\\u2019s of original ... recording masters\\u201d might have been destroyed in the warehouse, citing an anonymous source. The next day Finke published a \\u201cclarification,\\u201d quoting an unnamed representative from the record company: \\u201cThankfully, there was little lost from UMG\\u2019s vault. A majority of what was formerly stored there was moved earlier this year to our other facilities. Of the small amount that was still there and waiting to be moved, it had already been digitized so the music will still be around for many years to come.\\u201d The same day, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1045218/universal-music-group-masters-unharmed-in-fire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in the music trade publication Billboard</a>, a UMG spokesperson again pushed back against the idea that thousands of masters were destroyed with a more definitive denial: \\u201cWe had no loss.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These reassuring pronouncements concealed a catastrophe. When Randy Aronson stood outside the burning warehouse on June 1, he knew he was witnessing a historic event. \\u201cIt was like those end-of-the-world-type movies,\\u201d Aronson says. \\u201cI felt like my planet had been destroyed.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The archive in</strong> Building 6197 was UMG\\u2019s main West Coast storehouse of masters, the original recordings from which all subsequent copies are derived. A master is a one-of-a-kind artifact, the irreplaceable primary source of a piece of recorded music. According to UMG documents, the vault held analog tape masters dating back as far as the late 1940s, as well as digital masters of more recent vintage. It held multitrack recordings, the raw recorded materials \\u2014 each part still isolated, the drums and keyboards and strings on separate but adjacent areas of tape \\u2014 from which mixed or \\u201cflat\\u201d analog masters are usually assembled. And it held session masters, recordings that were never commercially released.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">UMG maintained additional tape libraries across the United States and around the world. But the label\\u2019s Vault Operations department was managed from the backlot, and the archive there housed some of UMG\\u2019s most prized material. There were recordings from dozens of record companies that had been absorbed by Universal over the years, including several of the most important labels of all time. The vault housed tape masters for Decca, the pop, jazz and classical powerhouse; it housed master tapes for the storied blues label Chess; it housed masters for Impulse, the groundbreaking jazz label. The vault held masters for the MCA, ABC, A&amp;M, Geffen and Interscope labels. And it held masters for a host of smaller subsidiary labels. Nearly all of these masters \\u2014 in some cases, the complete discographies of entire record labels \\u2014 were wiped out in the fire.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The scope of this calamity is laid out in litigation and company documents, thousands of pages of depositions and internal UMG files that I obtained while researching this article. UMG\\u2019s accounting of its losses, detailed in a March 2009 document marked \\u201cCONFIDENTIAL,\\u201d put the number of \\u201cassets destroyed\\u201d at 118,230. Randy Aronson considers that estimate low: The real number, he surmises, was \\u201cin the 175,000 range.\\u201d If you extrapolate from either figure, tallying songs on album and singles masters, the number of destroyed recordings stretches into the hundreds of thousands. In another confidential report, issued later in 2009, UMG asserted that \\u201can estimated 500K song titles\\u201d were lost.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The monetary value of this loss is difficult to calculate. Aronson recalls hearing that the company priced the combined total of lost tape and \\u201closs of artistry\\u201d at $150 million. But in historical terms, the dimension of the catastrophe is staggering. It\\u2019s impossible to itemize, precisely, what music was on each tape or hard drive in the vault, which had no comprehensive inventory. It cannot be said exactly how many recordings were original masters or what type of master each recording was. But legal documents, UMG reports and the accounts of Aronson and others familiar with the vault\\u2019s collection leave little doubt that the losses were profound, taking in a sweeping cross-section of popular music history, from postwar hitmakers to present-day stars.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among the incinerated Decca masters were recordings by titanic figures in American music: Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland. The tape masters for Billie Holiday\\u2019s Decca catalog were most likely lost in total. The Decca masters also included recordings by such greats as Louis Jordan and His Tympany Five and Patsy Cline.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fire most likely claimed most of Chuck Berry\\u2019s Chess masters and multitrack masters, a body of work that constitutes Berry\\u2019s greatest recordings. The destroyed Chess masters encompassed nearly everything else recorded for the label and its subsidiaries, including most of the Chess output of Muddy Waters, Howlin\\u2019 Wolf, Willie Dixon, Bo Diddley, Etta James, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy and Little Walter. Also very likely lost were master tapes of the first commercially released material by Aretha Franklin, recorded when she was a young teenager performing in the church services of her father, the Rev. C.L. Franklin, who made dozens of albums for Chess and its sublabels.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Virtually all of Buddy Holly\\u2019s masters were lost in the fire. Most of John Coltrane\\u2019s Impulse masters were lost, as were masters for treasured Impulse releases by Ellington, Count Basie, Coleman Hawkins, Dizzy Gillespie, Max Roach, Art Blakey, Sonny Rollins, Charles Mingus, Ornette Coleman, Alice Coltrane, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, Pharoah Sanders and other jazz greats. Also apparently destroyed were the masters for dozens of canonical hit singles, including Bill Haley and His Comets\\u2019 \\u201cRock Around the Clock,\\u201d Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats\\u2019 \\u201cRocket 88,\\u201d Bo Diddley\\u2019s \\u201cBo Diddley/I\\u2019m A Man,\\u201d Etta James\\u2019s \\u201cAt Last,\\u201d the Kingsmen\\u2019s \\u201cLouie Louie\\u201d and the Impressions\\u2019 \\u201cPeople Get Ready.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The list of destroyed single and album masters takes in titles by dozens of legendary artists, a genre-spanning who\\u2019s who of 20th- and 21st-century popular music. It includes recordings by Benny Goodman, Cab Calloway, the Andrews Sisters, the Ink Spots, the Mills Brothers, Lionel Hampton, Ray Charles, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Clara Ward, Sammy Davis Jr., Les Paul, Fats Domino, Big Mama Thornton, Burl Ives, the Weavers, Kitty Wells, Ernest Tubb, Lefty Frizzell, Loretta Lynn, George Jones, Merle Haggard, Bobby (Blue) Bland, B.B. King, Ike Turner, the Four Tops, Quincy Jones, Burt Bacharach, Joan Baez, Neil Diamond, Sonny and Cher, the Mamas and the Papas, Joni Mitchell, Captain Beefheart, Cat Stevens, the Carpenters, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Al Green, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Elton John, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Buffett, the Eagles, Don Henley, Aerosmith, Steely Dan, Iggy Pop, Rufus and Chaka Khan, Barry White, Patti LaBelle, Yoko Ono, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Police, Sting, George Strait, Steve Earle, R.E.M., Janet Jackson, Eric B. and Rakim, New Edition, Bobby Brown, Guns N\\u2019 Roses, Queen Latifah, Mary J. Blige, Sonic Youth, No Doubt, Nine Inch Nails, Snoop Dogg, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Hole, Beck, Sheryl Crow, Tupac Shakur, Eminem, 50 Cent and the Roots.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then there are masters for largely forgotten artists that were stored in the vault: tens of thousands of gospel, blues, jazz, country, soul, disco, pop, easy listening, classical, comedy and spoken-word records that may now exist only as written entries in discographies.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today Universal Music Group is a Goliath, by far the world\\u2019s biggest record company, with soaring revenues bolstered by a boom in streaming music and a market share nearly double that of its closest competitor, Sony Music Entertainment. Last year, Vivendi announced a plan to sell up to 50 percent of UMG. The sale is the talk of the music business; rumored potential buyers include Apple, Amazon and the Chinese conglomerate Alibaba. The price tag is expected to be hefty: In January, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/universal-music-group-is-worth-33bn-says-deutsche-bank/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Deutsche Bank raised its valuation of UMG</a> to more than $33 billion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The label\\u2019s dominance rests in large part on its roster of current chart toppers \\u2014 stars like Drake, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. But UMG\\u2019s reputation is also based on the great swaths of music history it owns, a canon that includes Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, Queen and many more artists and labels whose catalogs came under the UMG umbrella during decades of acquisition and consolidation. A key part of that legacy \\u2014 the originals of some of the company\\u2019s most culturally significant assets \\u2014 went up in smoke in 2008.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The vault fire was not, as UMG suggested, a minor mishap, a matter of a few tapes stuck in a musty warehouse. It was the biggest disaster in the history of the music business. UMG\\u2019s internal assessment of the event stands in contrast to its public statements. In a document prepared for a March 2009 \\u201cVault Loss Meeting,\\u201d the company described the damage in apocalyptic terms. \\u201cThe West Coast Vault perished, in its entirety,\\u201d the document read. \\u201cLost in the fire was, undoubtedly, a huge musical heritage.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The recordings that burned up in the Universal fire \\u2014 like the songs that are blasting from car windows on the street outside your home, like all the records that you or I or anyone else has ever heard \\u2014 represent a wonderment that we have come to take for granted. For most of human history, every word spoken, every song sung, was by definition ephemeral: Air vibrated and sound traveled in and out of earshot, never to be heard again. But technology gave humanity the means to catch sounds, to transform a soprano\\u2019s warble, a violin\\u2019s trill, Chuck Berry\\u2019s blaring guitar, into something permanent and repeatable, a sonic artifact to which listeners can return again and again.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The act of listening again has defined music culture for a century. It is also the basis of the multibillion-dollar record industry. Today a stupefying bounty of recordings is available on streaming audio services, floating free of the CDs, LPs and other delivery systems that once brought them to audiences. The metaphors we use to describe this mass of digitized sound bespeak our almost mystical sense that recorded music has dematerialized and slipped the bonds of earth. The Cloud. The Celestial Jukebox. Something close to the entire history of music hovers in the ether, waiting to be summoned into our earbuds by a tap on a touch-screen.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is the utopian tale we tell ourselves, at least. In fact, vast gaps remain between the historical corpus of recorded music and that which has been digitized. Gerald Seligman, executive director of the National Recording Preservation Foundation, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the Library of Congress, estimated in 2013 that less than 18 percent of commercial music archives had been transferred and made available through streaming and download services. That figure underscores a misapprehension: the assumption that the physical relics of recorded sound are obsolete and expendable. \\u201cIt feels as if music has evolved beyond the reach of objects,\\u201d says Andy Zax, a Grammy-nominated producer and writer who works on reissued recordings. \\u201cIn fact we are as dependent on irritating physical stuff as we ever were.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The objects in question are master recordings: millions of reels of magnetic tape, stored in libraries like the one that occupied the backlot vault. These archives hold other masters of various vintages: the lacquer, glass and metal masters that predated tape, and disk drives and digital tapes from the past few decades. They comprise, as Zax said at a music conference, \\u201ca bewildering array of formats: albums, singles, demos ... the entire careers of artists we know everything about and artists we know nothing about. ... The future of all of the recorded music that we have ever heard \\u2014 and, for that matter, all of the recorded music that we haven\\u2019t heard yet \\u2014 depends on our ability to maintain these artifacts.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is sonic fidelity, first and foremost, that defines the importance of masters. \\u201cA master is the truest capture of a piece of recorded music,\\u201d said Adam Block, the former president of Legacy Recordings, Sony Music Entertainment\\u2019s catalog arm. \\u201cSonically, masters can be stunning in their capturing of an event in time. Every copy thereafter is a sonic step away.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is not an academic point. The recording industry is a business of copies; often as not, it\\u2019s a business of copies of copies of copies. A Spotify listener who clicks on a favorite old song may hear a file in a compressed audio format called Ogg Vorbis. That file was probably created by converting an MP3, which may have been ripped years earlier from a CD, which itself may have been created from a suboptimal \\u201csafety copy\\u201d of the LP master \\u2014 or even from a dubbed duplicate of that dubbed duplicate. Audiophiles complain that the digital era, with its rampant copy-paste ethos and jumble of old and new formats, is an age of debased sound: lossy audio files created from nth-generation transfers; cheap vinyl reissues, marketed to analog-fetishists but pressed up from sludgy non-analog sources. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the audio equivalent of the game of \\u2018Telephone,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d says Henry Sapoznik, a celebrated producer of historical compilation albums. \\u201cWho really would be satisfied with the sixth message in?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The remedy is straightforward: You go back to the master. This is one reason that rereleases of classic albums are promoted as having been painstakingly remastered from the original tapes. It\\u2019s why consumers of new technologies, like CDs in the 1980s, are eager to hear familiar music properly recaptured for the format. Right now, sound-savvy consumers are taking the next leap forward into high-resolution audio, which can deliver streaming music of unprecedented depth and detail. But you can\\u2019t simply up-convert existing digital files to higher resolution. You have to return to the master and recapture it at a higher bit rate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the case for masters extends beyond arguments about bit depth and frequency ranges audible only to dogs. It enters the realms of aesthetics and phenomenology. Simply put, the master of a recording <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">is</em> that recording; it is the thing itself. The master contains the record\\u2019s details in their purest form: the grain of a singer\\u2019s voice, the timbres of instruments, the ambience of the studio. It holds the ineffable essence that can only truly be apprehended when you encounter a work of art up-close and unmediated, or as up-close and unmediated as the peculiar medium of recorded sound permits. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to be Walter Benjamin to understand that there\\u2019s a big difference between a painting and a photograph of that painting,\\u201d Zax said in his conference speech. \\u201cIt\\u2019s exactly the same with sound recordings.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The comparison to paintings is instructive. With a painting, our task as cultural stewards is to hang the thing properly, to keep it away from direct sunlight, to guard it from thieves. A painting must be maintained and preserved, but only in rare cases will a technological intervention improve our ability to <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">see</em> the artwork. If you were to stand before the Mona Lisa in an uncrowded gallery, you would be taking in the painting under more or less ideal circumstances. You will not get a better view.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the case of a recording, a better view is possible. With recourse to the master, a recording\\u2019s \\u201cpicture\\u201d can, potentially, be improved; the record can snap into sharper focus, its sound and meaning shining through with new clarity and brilliance. The reason is a technological time lag: For years, what people were able to record was of greater quality than what they were able to play back. \\u201cMost people don\\u2019t realize that recording technology was decades more sophisticated than playback technology,\\u201d Sapoznik says. \\u201cToday, we can decode information off original recordings that was impossible to hear at any time before.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The process of revisiting and decoding can transfigure the most familiar music. In May 2017, a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/arts/music/beatles-sgt-peppers-lonely-hearts-club-band-anniversary.html?module=inline" title="">new box set of the Beatles\\u2019 \\u201cSgt. Pepper\\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band\\u201d</a> was released to mark the album\\u2019s 50th anniversary. \\u201cSgt. Pepper\\u2019s\\u201d is one of the most famous recordings in history, but the version most listeners know is the stereo mix, which was of secondary importance to the Beatles, their producer George Martin and his engineer, Geoff Emerick. It was the mono mix that consumed the Beatles\\u2019 attention, and it is to those materials that the box set\\u2019s producer, Martin\\u2019s son Giles, returned, creating a fresh stereo mix from the mono masters. \\u201cThe job was to strip back layers, to get back to that original sound and intent,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThe detail we can garner from the mix compared to what they could have done 50 years ago is fantastic.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The result is a vivid new \\u201cSgt. Pepper\\u2019s.\\u201d In certain quarters, the album has been regarded as twee, but Giles Martin\\u2019s mix reveals a burlier rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll record. The box set opens new vistas on the album\\u2019s themes and adds force to its pathos. The opus \\u201cA Day in the Life\\u201d sounds more ominous than ever, a portent of late \\u201960s chaos, of the storm gathering on the other side of the Summer of Love. These epiphanies would not have been possible without masters. \\u201cWorking without the master tapes,\\u201d Martin says, \\u201cwould be like a chef having to use precooked food.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The \\u201cSgt. Pepper\\u2019s\\u201d masters are kept in a secure location in London. The tape boxes are marked with recording notes that helped guide Martin\\u2019s mixing decisions. The tapes themselves feature additional recordings \\u2014 alternate versions, overdubs, studio chatter \\u2014 that were included on the rerelease. Tens of millions of copies of \\u201cSgt. Pepper\\u2019s\\u201d have been sold over the years; it may seem precious to place special value on the original of a record that is so well known and ubiquitous. But the masters in the London archive are unique. They have greater fidelity than any copy of \\u201cSgt. Pepper\\u2019s\\u201d that is out in the world. They have more documentation than any version anywhere. And the masters contain more Beatles music too.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The same is surely true of many masters destroyed in the Universal fire. John Coltrane and Patsy Cline music has not vanished from the earth; right now you can use a streaming service to listen to Coltrane and Cline records whose masters burned on the backlot. But those masters still represent an irretrievable loss. When the tapes disappeared, so did the possibility of sonic revelations that could come from access to the original recordings. Information that was logged on or in the tape boxes is gone. And so are any extra recordings those masters may have contained \\u2014 music that may not have been heard by anyone since it was put on tape.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">There is another</strong> defining characteristic of masters \\u2014 the \\u201cSgt. Pepper\\u2019s\\u201d tapes, the tapes stacked on the shelves of Building 6197 and countless other masters as well. They are corporate assets. In 2019, most commercial recordings from the past century-plus are controlled by three gigantic record companies: UMG, Sony and Warner Music Group. These \\u201cbig three\\u201d labels get to exploit this material for profit. But they are also the warehousers of millions of cumbersome master recordings. They\\u2019re in the storage business.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That task is expensive and complex, and if the past is an indication, it may be a job for which record companies are ill suited. The Universal fire brought losses on an unprecedented scale, but it was only the most recent disaster to strike the masters holdings of American record labels. These disasters include not only events like fires but also instances of neglect and even willful destruction by the labels themselves, a hair-raising history that reaches back to the beginnings of the music business.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today industry professionals familiar with archiving practices question the big three labels\\u2019 commitment to preservation. (A number of these insiders, including individuals with knowledge of the backlot fire, spoke on condition of anonymity, concerned they could face professional consequences with UMG and other labels.) One audio specialist said: \\u201cLabels need to see payoff: \\u2018We have a release next year from this artist.\\u2019 But as far as, \\u2018We have this inventory on the shelves, let\\u2019s preserve it\\u2019 \\u2014 that\\u2019s not the attitude. An old recording that\\u2019s deteriorating on the shelf is not causing alarm.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The result is a crisis, a slow-motion assault on our musical heritage that is poorly understood by many within the record industry, to say nothing of the public at large. Had a loss of comparable magnitude to the Universal fire occurred at a different cultural institution \\u2014 say, the Metropolitan Museum of Art \\u2014 there might have been wider awareness of the event, perhaps some form of accountability. Yet the conservation mission faced by record labels may be no less vital than those of museums and libraries. Recorded music is arguably America\\u2019s great artistic patrimony, our supreme gift to world culture. How should it be safeguarded? And by whom?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I met Randy Aronson for the first time on a spring day in 2016. He was living in the same three-bedroom house where he had been jolted awake by a phone call on the morning of the fire. It was a small house, and it was a full one, occupied by Aronson and his wife, one of their two adult daughters, the daughter\\u2019s boyfriend, three dogs and a cat.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a young man, Aronson did some acting, and he recently returned to the stage, starring in a community-theater comedy about the 1930s golden age of radio. Aronson has the look of a guy who can do a good screwball turn. He is tall and husky, with an elastic face and eyes that hold a gleam. When I arrived at his house, he led me into the living room, where I noticed a BB gun. \\u201cThere are coyotes around here,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t shoot at them \\u2014 I shoot <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">around</em> them.\\u201d Aronson was adopted as an infant. His father worked as a repairman for the Otis Elevator Company for 35 years. \\u201cThat\\u2019s where I got my loyalty to one company,\\u201d Aronson said. \\u201cI know that sounds funny, under the circumstances.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In January 2016, Aronson lost his job at UMG. He had continued to direct the company\\u2019s vault operations following the fire, overseeing approximately 1.5 million master tapes that UMG maintained in storage facilities around the United States. He said he was never given a reason for his dismissal but chalks it up to differences of \\u201carchiving philosophy.\\u201d \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t speaking their language,\\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I sought out Aronson more than a year after learning about the vault fire. His account of events and knowledge of the vault\\u2019s contents confirmed the picture that had emerged from my review of legal documents and UMG\\u2019s internal records. Aronson admits he would not have consented to interviews were he still with UMG. But he insists he is not motivated by animus toward the company. He agreed to talk, he said, because he hopes the story of the fire will lead to a broader conversation about preservation. He expressed anxiety about his job prospects in light of his participation in this article. \\u201cI am a man of strong convictions on what I think is proper storage and preservation standards of music tape,\\u201d he wrote in an email in 2016. \\u201cI am also a 58-year-old man who is seeking employment with one of the few remaining music companies.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There\\u2019s no mistaking Aronson\\u2019s strong convictions, and strong emotions, about the Universal fire. In dozens of conversations and email exchanges, he described the event as a personal trauma. \\u201cSometimes I forget that there was life before the fire,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEven now, it gets me choked up, thinking about all those tapes.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The fate of</strong> all those tapes has been an open secret for years. It hides in plain sight on the internet, popping up on message boards frequented by record collectors and audio engineers. In a 2014 interview, Richard Carpenter, one-half of the superstar 1970s duo the Carpenters, stated that masters for the group\\u2019s multimillion-selling A&amp;M albums were lost on the backlot. \\u201cA lot of those masters ... they went up in the fire at Universal,\\u201d Carpenter said. References to the loss of Decca and Chess masters in the fire appeared more than three years ago in the Wikipedia entry for Universal Studios Hollywood and were still on the page at the time of this writing.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet the news has never reached the broader public. In part, this represents a triumph of crisis management. In the days following the fire, officials at UMG\\u2019s global headquarters in Santa Monica, Calif., and in New York scrambled to spin and contain press coverage.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In an email sent to UMG executives and P.R. staff members on June 3, 2008, Peter LoFrumento, the company\\u2019s spokesman, reported on efforts to downplay the story, attaching articles from The New York Times, The New York Daily News and The Los Angeles Times that reflected UMG\\u2019s account of events. The officials copied on the email included Zach Horowitz, UMG\\u2019s president and chief operating officer. Horowitz, who has since left the company, declined to comment for this article.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWe stuck to the script about physical backups and digital copies,\\u201d LoFrumento wrote in the email. The company, he claimed, had steered Jon Healey, a Los Angeles Times writer, toward a more favorable view: \\u201cWe were able to turn Healey around on his L.A. Times editorial so it\\u2019s not a reprimand on what we didn\\u2019t do, but more of a pat on the back for what we did.\\u201d That editorial, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-jun-03-ed-fire3-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published in the paper\\u2019s June 3 edition</a>, offered comforting news: \\u201cAt this point, it appears that the fire consumed no irreplaceable master recordings, just copies.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other newspaper accounts described damage to master recordings by little-known artists, whose names may have been cherry-picked by UMG in an effort to downplay the gravity of the loss. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/business/media/03studio.html?module=inline" title="">A New York Times article on June 3</a> cited recordings by \\u201cpop singers Lenny Dee and Georgie Shaw\\u201d as examples of the \\u201csmall number of tapes and other material by \\u2018obscure artists from the 1940s and \\u201950s\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d that were affected by the fire. The Times ascribed these assertions to a UMG spokesman. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/universal-studios-fire-silences-music-bing-crosby-connee-boswell-article-1.292141" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Daily News article</a> also invoked the loss of \\u201coriginal recordings from organ virtuoso Lenny Dee and 1950s hitmaker Georgie Shaw.\\u201d A possible explanation for the highlighting of Dee and Shaw comes from Aronson: He says that a UMG executive asked him, the day after the fire, for the names of \\u201ctwo artists nobody would recognize,\\u201d to be furnished to journalists seeking information on lost recordings.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That same June 3 Daily News article included a direct quotation from LoFrumento: \\u201cIn one sense it was a loss. In another, we were covered,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt had already been digitized, so the music will still be around for many years.\\u201d The claim about digital backups, which was reported by other news outlets, also seems to have been misleading. It is true that UMG\\u2019s vault-operations department had begun a digitization initiative, known as the Preservation Project, in late 2004. But company documents, and testimony given by UMG officials in legal proceedings, make clear that the project was modest; records show that at the time of the fire approximately 12,000 tapes, mostly analog multitracks visibly at risk of deterioration, had been transferred to digital storage formats. All of those originals and digital copies were stored in a separate facility in Pennsylvania; they were not the items at issue in the fire. The company\\u2019s sweeping assurance that \\u201cthe music\\u201d had been digitized appears to have been pure spin. \\u201cThe company knew that there would be shock and outrage if people found out the real story,\\u201d Aronson says. \\u201cThey did an outstanding job of keeping it quiet. It\\u2019s a secret I\\u2019m ashamed to have been a part of.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Doug Morris, UMG\\u2019s chairman and chief executive at the time of the fire, declined to comment for this article; he left the company in 2010. In a statement provided to The New York Times last month, a current UMG spokesman said that the company was unable to comment on the 2008 fire. \\u201cIn this case, there are constraints preventing us from publicly addressing some of the details of the fire that occurred at NBCUniversal Studios\\u2019 facility more than a decade ago,\\u201d the statement read. \\u201cHowever, in the intervening years, UMG has made significant investments \\u2014 in technology, infrastructure and by employing the industry\\u2019s foremost experts \\u2014 in order to best preserve and protect these musical assets and to accelerate the digitization and subsequent public availability of catalog recordings.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Back in 2008, UMG undoubtedly </strong>feared the public embarrassment that news of the losses could bring. But Aronson and others suggest that UMG was especially concerned about repercussions with the artists, and the estates of artists, whose recordings were destroyed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Record contracts are notoriously slanted in the favor of labels, which benefit disproportionately from sales and, in most cases, hold ownership of masters. For decades, standard artists\\u2019 contracts stipulated that recordings were \\u201cwork for hire,\\u201d with record companies retaining control of masters in perpetuity. It is a paradox of the record business: Labels have often been cavalier about physically safeguarding masters, but they are zealous guardians of their ownership and intellectual-property rights.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Certain musicians, usually big stars, negotiate ownership of masters. (\\u201cIf you don\\u2019t own your masters, your master owns you,\\u201d <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/17/arts/a-re-inventor-of-his-world-and-himself.html?module=inline" title="">quipped Prince in 1996</a>, at the height of a high-profile standoff with Warner Brothers.) It is unclear how many of the artists whose work was lost in the Universal vault had ownership of their physical masters, or were seeking it. But by definition, artists have a stake in the intellectual property contained on those masters, and many artists surely expected UMG to safeguard the material for potential later use. Had word of the fire\\u2019s toll emerged, many of the biggest names in pop music, and many profitable artist estates, would have learned that UMG had lost core documents their catalogs rest on \\u2014 a source for everything from potentially lucrative reissues to historical preservation to posthumous releases. That scenario could have exposed UMG to a storm of questions, threats and reputational damage from across the industry.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in the decade since the fire, UMG has faced little apparent blowback from artists or their representatives. It is probable that musicians whose masters were destroyed have no idea that a vault holding UMG masters had burned down. (A UMG spokesperson, asked if there has been any systematic effort to inform artists of the losses, said the company \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t publicly discuss our private conversations with artists and estates.\\u201d)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The closest UMG came to a public imbroglio may have been in 2010, when, Aronson says, he was sent on an unusual business trip to Pennsylvania. He had been told by a UMG executive that one of the most powerful men in the music industry, Irving Azoff, was asking questions about the loss of Steely Dan masters in the fire. Azoff, the former chairman of MCA Inc., is now the chairman and chief executive of Azoff MSG Entertainment, a live entertainment conglomerate, as well as the \\u201csupermanager\\u201d chairman of Full Stop Management, whose roster of clients includes Steely Dan and the Eagles. A quarrel with Azoff was an unwelcome prospect. Luckily, the tapes he was concerned about, multitrack masters of Steely Dan\\u2019s first releases, turned out to have been moved to UMG\\u2019s Pennsylvania tape vault before the fire.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Azoff sent Elliot Scheiner, a celebrated record producer and mixer who had worked with Steely Dan, to confirm the tapes were intact. Aronson accompanied Scheiner to the Pennsylvania facility, the tapes were pulled, the matter was dropped. (Asked about this incident, both Azoff and Scheiner declined to comment.) In fact, UMG documents suggest that Steely Dan masters \\u2014 different tapes than those sought by Azoff \\u2014 were in Building 6197 when the fire hit. According to Aronson, these likely included certain album masters, as well as multitrack masters holding outtakes and unreleased material. \\u201cThose songs,\\u201d Aronson says, \\u201cwill never be heard again.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">UMG avoided bad</strong> publicity, but in the months after the fire, the feelings of shock and chagrin remained acute for Aronson and his vault operations colleagues. As for senior executives, it is unclear how engaged they were in the questions debated, and the decisions made, in the fire\\u2019s aftermath. \\u201cI got the sense they felt the less top executives knew, the less accountable they\\u2019d be,\\u201d Aronson says. \\u201cI felt I was being shielded from top execs and carted in for insurance and legal meetings.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There were many such meetings. In December 2009, UMG filed a lawsuit against NBCUniversal, its former landlord at the vault, seeking compensatory damages for losses suffered in the fire. (Much of what we know about the event comes from depositions and documents that emerged from this litigation.) The suit claimed that NBCUniversal, which leased the backlot vault to UMG, \\u201cbreached their duty of care,\\u201d resulting in the destruction of the warehouse and its contents. Legal wrangling ensued for more than three years, until February 2013, when UMG dropped the suit and the parties settled for an undisclosed sum. (Spokespeople for UMG and NBCUniversal declined to comment.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The position staked out by UMG in the lawsuit was the opposite of that in its public statements. Rather than minimizing the fire\\u2019s impact, the company sought to prove the gravity of the event and the loss incurred. Aronson\\u2019s knowledge of the fire\\u2019s toll made him valuable to that cause. He was deposed multiple times and asked by UMG lawyers to submit declarations to the court on four occasions. \\u201cAlthough it was never said to me, I was certain that they loved my candor for legal reasons,\\u201d Aronson says. \\u201cI was the perfect counter to news releases that said the whole thing was a minor event.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The history of music-archiving misfortunes extends far beyond UMG\\u2019s ruined vault. It stretches back decades and encompasses nearly every significant record label. That history was detailed by a journalist, Bill Holland, in a two-part expos\\xe9, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eg4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Bill+Holland+%E2%80%9Cuntold+numbers+of+recordings,+old+and+not+so+old.%E2%80%9D+Billboard+in+July+1997&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cI4a-uzmzD&amp;sig=ACfU3U3v1DjJLOFsVn5DQwkq0V2O6ZxNlw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiz9rLiqN_iAhVRnlkKHTVkDpUQ6AEwAHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Bill%20Holland%20%E2%80%9Cuntold%20numbers%20of%20recordings%2C%20old%20and%20not%20so%20old.%E2%80%9D%20Billboard%20in%20July%201997&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published in Billboard in July 1997</a>. Holland revealed the loss and destruction of \\u201cuntold numbers of recordings, old and not so old.\\u201d Record companies have tossed masters in bulk into dumpsters and buried them in landfills. During World War II, labels donated metal parts masters to salvage drives. Three decades later, employees of CBS Records carved up multitrack masters with power saws so the reels could be sold to scrap metal dealers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Catalog material by top stars sometimes suffered the same fate as obscure recordings. Holland discovered that a purge of multitracks at RCA in the 1970s included <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/28/arts/all-shook-up-over-cutting-and-selling-of-elvis-tape.html?module=inline" title="">tapes by the best-selling act in the label\\u2019s history, Elvis Presley</a>. Countless more recordings have been lost to shoddy storage practices. Tapes have been mislabeled, misplaced and misfiled; tapes have been marooned on high shelves in disorderly warehouses, left at loading docks, abandoned at shuttered recording studios. In 1972, decades before the Universal inferno, a fire struck an MGM Records warehouse. Holland reported that masters for MGM and the jazz label Verve were damaged or destroyed in the fire and in the months following, when surviving recordings were kept in an open shed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The preservation laxities were dictated by what seemed at the time to be common sense. For decades, the music industry was exclusively a business of now, of today\\u2019s hot release, of this week\\u2019s charts \\u2014 of hits, not history. \\u201cNobody cared about catalog,\\u201d says an industry veteran. \\u201cStuff that was five years old might as well have been 1,000 years old.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One insider said, \\u201cMost senior executives in the record business have no understanding of what masters are, why you need to store them, what the point of them is.\\u201d Crucially, masters were not seen as capable of generating revenue. On the contrary: They were expensive to warehouse and therefore a drain on resources. To record-company accountants, a tape vault was inherently a cost center, not a profit center.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These attitudes prevailed even at visionary labels like Atlantic Records, which released hundreds of recordings by black artists beginning in the late 1940s. In his Billboard expos\\xe9, Holland mentioned a 1978 fire in an \\u201cAtlantic Records storage facility in Long Branch, N.J.\\u201d Holland did not reveal that the \\u201cfacility\\u201d was the former home of Vogel\\u2019s Department Store, owned by the family of Sheldon Vogel, Atlantic\\u2019s chief financial officer. Late in the 1970s, Vogel told me, Ahmet Ertegun, Atlantic\\u2019s president, complained about tapes cramming the label\\u2019s Manhattan office. Vogel suggested moving the material to the empty Long Branch building.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Vogel was on vacation on Feb. 8, 1978, when he learned the building had burned down. The 5,000-plus lost tapes comprised nearly all of the session reels, alternate takes and unreleased masters recorded for Atlantic and its sublabels between 1949 and 1969, a period when its roster featured R.&amp;B., soul and jazz luminaries, including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman. Today the importance of those tapes is self-evident: thousands of hours of unheard music by some of history\\u2019s greatest recording artists. But to Atlantic in 1978, the tapes were a nuisance. According to Vogel, Atlantic collected \\u201cmaybe a couple of million dollars\\u201d in insurance on the destroyed masters. It seemed like a good deal.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWe thought, Boy, what a windfall,\\u201d Vogel says. \\u201cWe thought the insurance was worth far more than the recordings. Eventually, the true value of those recordings became apparent.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">When Randy Aronson</strong> began working as a music archivist in the mid-1980s, he had no idea what a master was. He grew up in central Los Angeles and, like many L.A. kids, his ambition was to get into show business. He did some theater during the years he attended college and continued acting into his early 20s, performing in dinner theater while making ends meet with odd jobs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 1983, when he was 25, Aronson took a full-time position on the Universal Studios lot, in the mailroom. To work on the lot was to bask in Hollywood history and Hollywood kitsch. The site was opened in 1915 in a rural stretch of northern Los Angeles. Gradually, that pastoral site became the lot, a bustling maze of offices, sets and soundstages. In 1958, the Music Corporation of America (MCA Inc.) bought the lot from Universal Pictures. In 1964, MCA executives, seeking a new source of revenue, developed a studio tour, which soon expanded into a full-fledged amusement park, with rides and attractions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After two years in the mailroom, Aronson sought new work on the lot. In the spring of 1985, he got a temporary position in the tape vault of MCA Records, the music conglomerate that would later be renamed Universal Music Group. It wasn\\u2019t a glamorous gig. The archive was huge and poorly organized, with thousands of tapes misshelved or improperly labeled. Aronson\\u2019s task was to impose order on the chaos.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He had no previous experience with preservation work; he was fuzzy on the basics of sound recording. He learned, he says, \\u201ctape by tape.\\u201d Aronson was a rock fan with a deep appreciation for the musical past. He was tickled when he stumbled on tapes for favorite albums, like the Mamas and the Papas\\u2019 \\u201cIf You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears.\\u201d The work was tedious, but Aronson had a strong sense of mission and of his own good fortune. When he arrived at the vault each day, he had the feeling he was entering a cathedral stocked with relics.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Less than a year after taking the temp job, Aronson was asked to run the archive. It was a period of sea change in the music industry. In the early 1980s, the first compact discs had appeared in American record stores. Over the next decade and a half, CDs would turbocharge the business, a run that climaxed in 1999, when revenue from recorded music in the United States reached $14.6 billion. LPs had dominated for more than 30 years, but the arrival of CDs encouraged listeners to replace record collections at huge markups, paying up to three times the price for an old album in a crisp new format. The avidity with which consumers snatched up even poor-quality CD reissues was a revelation: proof that catalogs could be cash cows.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The result was a reissue boom. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/26/arts/pop-music-what-lurks-inside-the-vaults-producers.html?module=inline" title="">Master tapes were essential to this new line of business</a>. But at the MCA vault, Aronson and his colleagues faced challenges, the consequences of archiving failures dating back decades. Aronson grew accustomed to finding gaps in the collection, \\u201ctapes that should have been there and were not,\\u201d he says.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The vault facility itself was problematic. MCA\\u2019s music tapes were stored on the ground floor of the film-archive building. The temperature in the vault was 35 degrees Fahrenheit, the correct conditions for storing film, but too cold for music tapes. When masters were pulled and transported to recording studios, they emerged from the frigid vault into the Southern California heat. Aronson received reports that tapes were arriving at studios in bad shape, cracked and crumbling.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By 1990, MCA\\u2019s music archive had moved to a new home on the backlot: Building 6197, a big metal shack that had been built to store theme-park souvenirs. A new concrete foundation was poured to accommodate a heavy load of tapes, and HVAC systems were installed. Yet problems persisted. The inventory was still kept on 5 x 7 cards, and the checkout system involved scrawled notes in three-ring binders. \\u201cWe got the vault to a point where it was well organized,\\u201d Aronson says. \\u201cBut it wasn\\u2019t well inventoried. It was hard to sell a return-on-investment on an inventory. It was not a company priority.\\u201d Without a proper inventory, MCA had only a vague idea of what was, and wasn\\u2019t, in its archive. \\u201cWhen someone asked for a tape, we\\u2019d look on the shelf and see if it was there,\\u201d Aronson says. \\u201cIf it wasn\\u2019t, we knew we had a problem.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Soon, new concerns arose. In the fall of 1990, a Universal Studios security guard started a fire that whipped across the backlot, causing an estimated $25 million in damage. (The guard was convicted of arson.) The fire reached the doorstep of Building 6197, but firefighters beat back the flames. Aronson began to reconsider the prudence of maintaining a tape library on the studio backlot.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cFor a long time, I was seduced by the lot,\\u201d Aronson says. \\u201cIt was like being in Narnia. I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger in a dress smoking a cigar. There were camels and elephants walking past. I was so in love with being on the lot, I hadn\\u2019t thought through the dangers.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Five large fires had hit the backlot in the years between the studio\\u2019s founding and the arson incident. In 1997, another major fire was ignited by an overturned set light. There were pyrotechnic materials on the backlot, used in films and featured in tourist attractions. \\u201cThe King Kong ride had explosions, all day every day,\\u201d Aronson says. \\u201cFlames shooting up. Right next door to the vault.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to the backlot archive, UMG had tape collections in Pennsylvania, outside Nashville, in upstate New York and in a separate location in Los Angeles. Over the years, the company\\u2019s masters holdings grew as mergers and acquisitions brought new labels \\u2014 and new tape libraries \\u2014 into MCA\\u2019s portfolio. In 1995, the Seagram Company acquired an 80 percent interest in MCA Inc.; the following year, MCA\\u2019s music division was renamed Universal Music Group. Seagram purchased PolyGram Records in December 1998 and soon merged it with UMG, adding several hundred thousand masters to the company\\u2019s archives. Most PolyGram masters \\u2014 including material released on such sublabels as Mercury, Island and Motown \\u2014 were housed in a rented warehouse in Edison, N.J.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One day in May 2004, Aronson got a call from a colleague. A crisis was unfolding at the New Jersey warehouse. According to depositions in UMG\\u2019s later litigation with NBCUniversal, an accident in the warehouse space directly above UMG\\u2019s tape vault resulted in a broken water main. Aronson flew to New Jersey, where he learned that the upstairs tenant, a food-service company, had loaded too many pallets of salad dressing into its storage hold, caving in the ceiling above the UMG vault and rupturing a pipe as it crashed down. At the warehouse, Aronson beheld a gory scene: collapsed Sheetrock, dangling electricity lines, hundreds of shattered salad-dressing bottles and a foot of water flooding a vault that held 350,000 master tapes, including the entire Motown catalog. The destruction of all those masters was averted only by quick action: a rescue-and-restoration effort which, according to Aronson, cost $12 million and entailed the hiring of a dozen trucks equipped with 53-foot refrigerated trailers to freeze-dry wet tapes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even more than the 1990 backlot fire, the New Jersey incident shook Aronson\\u2019s assumptions about how, and where, UMG should secure its masters. Aronson says he urged UMG to abandon the backlot, shifting the recordings to a safer location. Eventually, Aronson says, a compromise was reached: Most of the session reels and multitracks stored on the backlot, about 250,000 tapes, were moved to the archive in Pennsylvania. This left approximately 120,000 masters \\u2014 175,000, if you accept Aronson\\u2019s estimate \\u2014 in Building 6197. These were the recordings that burned on June 1, 2008.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI get why there was a feeling of safety,\\u201d Aronson says. \\u201cWe had our own fire department. But still I look back on it and I wonder: What the [expletive] was anybody thinking putting a tape vault in an amusement park?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On May 27, 2010, a group of celebrities, politicians and Universal Studios officials appeared at a news conference on the Universal backlot <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/05/universal-new-york-street-makeover.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">to mark the reopening of New York Street</a>. The speakers, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and the president of Universal Studios, Ron Meyer, praised the firefighters who had battled the 2008 inferno and rhapsodized about the rebuilt set. The name given by Universal to its rebuilding effort struck a heady note of regeneration and renewal: The Phoenix Project.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A year and a half earlier, Universal Music Group embarked on its own recovery project. In an apparent coincidence, the program\\u2019s nickname was nearly identical to the one chosen by its former sister company. But UMG\\u2019s Project Phoenix would not culminate in a splashy ceremony; no gleaming tape vault would rise from the ashes. In the decade-plus since the fire, UMG has shifted many of its masters into the hands of third parties. This is typical of the record industry at large: In the 21st century, the job of archiving major labels\\u2019 masters has largely been outsourced.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">UMG began Project Phoenix in October 2008. The plan was to gather duplicates of recordings whose masters were lost. Those copies would then be digitally transferred to reconstitute the lost archive \\u2014 albeit in sonically inferior form, with recordings generations removed from the true masters. UMG undertook a global hunt, searching for safety copies and other duplicates at a variety of locations in the United States and abroad. The project lasted two years and, by Aronson\\u2019s estimate, recovered perhaps a fifth of what had been lost. The recordings were transferred to Linear Tape-Open, or LTO, a tape format used for archiving digital data. Copies were placed in storage holds on both coasts: at an underground vault in Boyers, Pa., and a high-rise facility in Hollywood. Both vaults are run by Iron Mountain, the global information-management and storage giant.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">UMG is not alone in its reliance on the multibillion-dollar company. Founded in 1951 under the name Iron Mountain Atomic Storage Corporation, the company initially catered to the warehousing needs of American businesses and to Cold War anxieties, promising to secure documents in a nuclear attack. By the 1980s, its warehouses and subterranean vaults held paperwork and assets for private concerns and public institutions, from banks to corporations to the federal government, which remains a major client.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today several of the company\\u2019s nearly 1,500 facilities are devoted to entertainment assets. Warner Music Group stores hundreds of thousands of master recordings in Iron Mountain\\u2019s Southern California facilities, and nearly all of Sony Music Entertainment\\u2019s United States masters holdings \\u2014 more than a million recordings \\u2014 are reportedly kept in Iron Mountain warehouses in Rosendale, N.Y. The Boyers, Pa., facility where UMG keeps most of its United States masters is a 1.7-million-square-foot former limestone mine. The facility offers optimal archive conditions, climate control and armed guards.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For labels, Iron Mountain is a one-stop shop. In addition to providing storage, it runs on-site studios, so staff members can pull tapes and send digital transfers to labels online, avoiding any need for recordings to leave the premises. Yet some music-business insiders regard this arrangement as a mixed bargain. When masters arrive at Iron Mountain, they say, institutional memory \\u2014 archivists\\u2019 firsthand knowledge of poorly inventoried stacks \\u2014 evaporates, as does the possibility of finding lost material, either by dogged digging or chance discovery. (Many treasures in tape vaults have been stumbled upon by accident.) Tapes can be retrieved only when requested by bar-code number, and labels pay fees for each request. For years, rumors have circulated among insiders about legendary albums whose masters have gone missing in Iron Mountain because labels recorded incorrect bar-code numbers. The kind of mass tape-pull that would be necessary to unearth lost recordings is both financially and logistically impractical.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI\\u2019ve always thought of Iron Mountain as that warehouse in the last scene of \\u2018Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d says Thane Tierney, who co-founded Universal\\u2019s now-defunct reissue label Hip-O Select. \\u201cJust endless rows of stuff. It\\u2019s perfectly safe, but there\\u2019s no access, no possibility of serendipity. Nearly all the tapes that go in will never come off the shelf. They\\u2019re lost to history.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">There are other </strong>institutions devoted to preserving sound recordings. In January 2011, the recorded-sound section of the Library of Congress announced its largest-ever acquisition: approximately 200,000 metal parts, aluminum and glass lacquer disc masters, donated by Universal Music Group. The recordings, dating from 1926 to 1948, are among the oldest extant masters in UMG\\u2019s catalog. Physical ownership of the masters was permanently transferred from UMG to the federal government; UMG retained the intellectual-property rights. The library is free to preserve the recordings, digitize them and make them available to scholars. The label can continue to exploit them commercially. For the label, it\\u2019s a great deal, transferring preservation responsibility for some of its most fragile assets while saving on storage costs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today, of course, a seemingly infinite music library sits at the fingertips of every smartphone owner. The rise of Napster and file sharing in the early 2000s decimated the music business; as recently as 2015, the industry was widely judged to have been broken by digital piracy. But with the rise of streaming, a new era has arrived. In each of the past three years, recorded-music retail revenues have surged by more than 10 percent, with the Recording Industry Association of America reporting $9.85 billion in revenue for 2018. A full 75 percent of that revenue came from streaming, and more than half of the total went to UMG, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8496609/power-100-lucian-grainge-no-1-universal-music-group" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in what Billboard described</a> as possibly \\u201cthe most dominant year by a music company in modern history.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This streaming boom is only the latest in a long history of technological upheavals in the music industry. Shifts in format \\u2014 from wax cylinders to shellac discs to LPs to CDs and MP3s and now streaming \\u2014 arrive periodically to transform the record trade. The newest development is a shift within a shift, the advent of high-resolution audio, with streaming services offering premium products built on high-quality sound. The platform Tidal recently started a subscription product called Tidal Masters, described by the company as \\u201cthe ultimate audio experience ... thousands of master-quality songs.\\u201d As in the CD era, the industry is trading on the mystique of masters \\u2014 and once again it is running up against the imperative of keeping those original recordings around and in good shape. To deliver \\u201cmaster quality\\u201d audio, you must return to the masters. The loss and discovery of these ur-recordings is a perennial topic of interest in music news: In the past few weeks, Prince fans savored the release of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/arts/music/prince-originals-demo-album.html?module=inline" title="">a new collection</a> of classic song demos pulled from his vault, while Mike D of the Beastie Boys <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/master-tapes-beastie-boys-license-to-ill-disappeared-1203230676/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">made news</a> by revealing that the masters of their hugely popular 1986 debut album cannot be located.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The resurgence of the record industry in the streaming era would seem to bode well for the cause of preservation. In 2017, Bruce Resnikoff, the head of UMG\\u2019s catalog division, told Billboard that \\u201cthe catalog business is having its biggest expansion since the CD.\\u201d <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.buzzanglemusic.com/wp-content/uploads/BuzzAngle-Music-2018-US-Report-Industry.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">A report by BuzzAngle</a>, which analyzes online music consumption, found that about half the music streamed on demand in the United States last year was \\u201cdeep catalog,\\u201d songs three or more years old. A catalog boom could theoretically push labels to digitize more archival recordings. But a question remains as to how deep \\u201cdeep catalog\\u201d extends. The old songs most listeners are streaming are either recent hits or classics by huge artists like the Beatles and Bob Marley. Labels may not see much incentive to digitize less-popular material.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some view digitization as a moral imperative. Archiving failures have left untold numbers of analog masters damaged and in states of decay. Gerald Seligman, the National Recording Preservation Foundation director, sees a ticking time-bomb scenario: Endangered masters need to be identified and transferred before they are no longer playable. \\u201cThe figure I hear is about 10 years,\\u201d Seligman says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the window we have to digitize massive amounts of music on improperly-cared-for perishable media.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But digital recordings are perishable in their own right \\u2014 far less stable, in fact, than recordings on magnetic tape. A damaged analog tape is not necessarily a lost cause: An engineer may be able to perform restoration work and get the recording to play. But when a digital medium is compromised, it is most likely gone. Many masters from recent decades are kept on hard drives, notoriously fragile mechanisms that may not function after sitting for years in a vault. Today, labels increasingly rely on digital-tape formats like LTO. But LTO is backward compatible for just two generations. Labels must either continually retransfer their archives or maintain outdated playback equipment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All these problems are exacerbated by the structure of the music business, in which hundreds of labels have been consolidated into three huge ones, which in turn have been absorbed by global conglomerates. The necessity of safeguarding a sound-recording heritage may appear abstract to executives at a distant parent company, who may simply see an expense on a balance sheet marked \\u201cStorage.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fate of millions of recordings does finally come down to blunt cost-benefit judgments. To invest in comprehensive preservation and digitization programs is not cheap, but it\\u2019s not beyond the means of UMG or the other major labels. \\u201cIt all comes down to funding and priorities,\\u201d Seligman says. Eleven years after the fire, UMG defends its commitment to conservation. \\u201cIn the last five years alone,\\u201d its statement says, \\u201cwe have more than doubled our investment in storage, preservation and metadata enrichment while developing state-of-the-art systems to support our global efforts around capturing, preserving and future-proofing our many media assets.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even critics concede that to cast blame solely on penurious corporations is to ignore a bigger picture. In recent decades, the cause of film preservation has made strides, spurred in part by the politicking and largess of individuals like the movie director Martin Scorsese, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/martin-scorsese-on-fighting-for-film-preservation-and-not-believing-in-old-movies-57150/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">who has embraced preservation as a crusade</a>. No analogous effort has taken place within music. Artists famous for activism around masters, like Prince, have construed the issue strictly as a labor-versus-management struggle, a matter of individual artists\\u2019 rights, not as a question of collective cultural patrimony. The most prominent musician to advocate for sound preservation on broader historical grounds is the singer-songwriter Jack White, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://pitchfork.com/news/51680-jack-white-donates-200k-to-the-national-recording-preservation-foundation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">who donated $200,000</a> to the National Recording Preservation Foundation and sat on its board.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cPeople who have made fortunes in film have been more interested in contributing toward preservation than those who\\u2019ve made fortunes in music,\\u201d Seligman says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s viewed as a niche issue, when in fact it\\u2019s an existential issue. Musicians themselves don\\u2019t seem to understand what\\u2019s at stake.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Until recently, Randy Aronson never listened to streaming music. Now he is one of Spotify\\u2019s reported 100 million subscribers. \\u201cThe music sounds like it was mastered in a Coke can,\\u201d he says. \\u201cBut on long drives, it\\u2019s the best.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The past couple of years have brought changes for Aronson. The new archiving job he\\u2019d hoped for never materialized. Now, he says, \\u201cMy enthusiasm for the music business has dimmed.\\u201d In September 2017, Aronson and his wife, Jamie, sold their house, bought a trailer, and drove nearly 650 miles to Humboldt County, on the Northern California coast. Today they live in the trailer, in a campground near a state park. Jamie works in the health care industry. For a while, Aronson worked as a security guard in a shopping mall. He recently started a new job as a project coordinator at a nonprofit that serves low-income residents of Humboldt.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Aronson still broods about the Universal fire. He reflects on his earliest days at MCA. \\u201cWhen I saw those names on the tape-box bindings, my mind reeled,\\u201d he said recently. <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">\\u201cThere\\u2019s Elton John, there\\u2019s Steely Dan. Here I am with Chuck [expletive] Berry.\\u201d</em> Aronson recalls the Bing Crosby tapes, the Ella Fitzgerald tapes, the Louis Armstrong tapes. \\u201cThe disappointment and responsibility I feel is sometimes overwhelming,\\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of the sharpest pangs come when Aronson\\u2019s thoughts drift to lesser-known records. A loss that hits him hard, he says, are the tapes of Moms Mabley, the pioneering black female comedian who released 16 LPs for Chess in the 1960s. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not like Moms was selling in huge numbers,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI doubt there\\u2019s many copies out there.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are more mysterious losses. \\u201cSo many things would come to the vault straight from studios and get shelved,\\u201d he says. \\u201cYou know, Nirvana production masters with extra songs no one ever heard. There were Chess boxes that just said, \\u2018Session.\\u2019 Often there was no other info, no metadata. Who knows what was on those tapes? We\\u2019ll never know.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The specter of these unknowns hovers over the Universal disaster. But many of the destroyed recordings fit a different profile. They were, you might say, super-deep catalog: masters for thousands of also-rans, records that neither clicked commercially nor achieved cult status and slipped through the historiographical cracks. Even if a massive digitization program had been in place, it would likely not have extended to forgotten bubble-gum singles, disco one-offs and other long-lost nonstarters.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A skeptic might argue that this is as it should be. In the 140-odd years since Thomas Edison invented the phonograph, countless recordings have been made under the auspices of record companies. To conserve anything close to all those recordings has proved impossible; it may not even be desirable. The caretaking of canonical material, the Bings and Billies and Nirvanas, must naturally take priority. To ask that the same level of attention be lavished on all music, including stuff that holds interest only for obscurantists, is to demand a preservation standard that prevails in no other area of culture. If the sole vestiges of thousands of old recordings are a few stray 45s lining the shelves of collectors \\u2014 perhaps that\\u2019s not a cultural tragedy, perhaps that\\u2019s a commercial-art ecosystem functioning properly.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Perhaps. But history holds a counterargument. Many recordings were ignored for decades, only to be rediscovered and enshrined as Imperishable Art. The Velvet Underground were a commercial bust in the late 1960s and early \\u201970s but have proved to be one of the most influential groups in history. Then there\\u2019s Nick Drake, the English singer-songwriter who recorded three LPs of dreamy jazz-inflected folk between 1969 and 1972, before his death at age 26. During Drake\\u2019s lifetime, his albums sold modestly. A cult fan base developed following the release of a box set; in 1999, Drake\\u2019s song \\u201cPink Moon\\u201d appeared in a Volkswagen commercial, and sales went through the roof. All three of Drake\\u2019s LPs were included in Rolling Stone magazine\\u2019s 2005 tally of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe music business intercepted about a century\\u2019s worth of sounds, the vast majority of which it lost money on,\\u201d says Andy Zax, the producer and writer. \\u201cMuch of that music, at any given moment, may seem dated, irrelevant, terrible. The most powerful argument for preservation is simply: \\u2018We don\\u2019t know.\\u2019 The sounds from the past that seem vital to us in the present keep changing. Since we don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going to be important, we have to err on the side of inclusivity and insist that the entities that own our cultural history do the same.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Recently I\\u2019ve been on a hunt </strong>\\u2014 rooting through used record stores and scouring the internet to find rarities whose master tapes burned in the UMG fire. Some of these records were reissued and have found their way onto streaming services. The music may have trickled online elsewhere, preserved by some private enthusiast: Someone uploaded a song or two to YouTube or digitized an LP and posted it on a blog. Often the recordings are available only on the vinyl that was sent out to record shops decades ago.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I\\u2019ve discovered the riches of labels I\\u2019d never heard of: Back Beat, Argo, Nashboro. I\\u2019ve listened to gospel and blues on Peacock, to psychedelic rock on Probe. I took a particular interest in AVI Records, whose catalog includes a bit of everything: rock and funk and soul, a slew of disco singles, more than two dozen Liberace LPs. As a teenager, I was a rabid record collector; later, I worked as a pop critic, laboring under the impression that my grasp of music history was firm. But tracking down remnants of the UMG disaster has been a lesson in the limits of standard historical narratives and a reminder of music\\u2019s illimitable plenteousness. The vault on the Universal lot housed another history, a shadow canon of 20th-century pop.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">AVI Records was hit hard by the backlot fire. According to UMG documents, AVI\\u2019s entire catalog of 9,866 tapes was destroyed. One of those tapes was the master for an LP by Don Bennett, \\u201cThe Prince Teddy Album,\\u201d released in 1977. Bennett is a fascinating figure who straddled musical worlds. He grew up in Pasadena. In his early 20s, he began writing and arranging soul-flavored pop records by independent artists. Bennett was black, but he defied the music industry\\u2019s racial typecasting. Around 1967, he drifted into Los Angeles\\u2019s garage-rock scene; he did arrangement work on records by the renowned L.A. band the Standells and can be heard singing lead vocals on some recordings by another influential group, the Chocolate Watchband. Bennett also has writing credits on songs by both bands, including what may qualify as the earliest musical sendup of hippie counterculture and one of the first punk-rock-like sentiments ever recorded, the Chocolate Watchband\\u2019s \\u201cAre You Gonna Be There (At the Love-In)?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The bulk of Bennett\\u2019s musical production dates from a 10-year period between the late 1960s and late 1970s. He formed a pop-soul band that recorded one single and led a hard-rock trio that released two albums. But Bennett released no recordings after 1978. According to one of his former bandmates in Los Angeles, Bennett died sometime in the late 1990s. You won\\u2019t find his name in history books, but if you dig into his scattered discography you meet an original: a musician who combined a command of craft with an insurgent\\u2019s flair for the impish and odd \\u2014 the kind of weirdness that can\\u2019t be faked.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201c<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.discogs.com/Don-Bennett-The-Prince-Teddy-Album/release/1927209" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Prince Teddy Album</a>\\u201d was Bennett\\u2019s fullest musical statement that ever saw commercial release. Today it is a musical endangered species. It was never reissued, and its digital footprint appears to comprise just two and a half songs, posted to YouTube by users who, evidently, made transfers from the vinyl. Those songs were enough to pique my interest: Last year I bought the LP online for $75. At the time, there were just a few copies for sale; it\\u2019s unlikely that many more copies are out there. It turned out to be one of the great impulse purchases of my life. The album throws together muscular funk, blasts of electric guitar, eerie synthesizer undulations, lush Philadelphia soul. The inspiration of Sly Stone and George Clinton is audible in Bennett\\u2019s singing and in the woozy blend of genres. But a list of influences doesn\\u2019t tell the tale: The cleverness of the songwriting and arrangements, the slightly shaggy singing and playing \\u2014 it seems to originate from its own musical planet.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The tone is set by the album-opening song, \\u201c<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://youtu.be/YJH9HDjbUD0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Don\\u2019t Wanna Spoil Your High</a>.\\u201d It begins with a dissonant rumble from a keyboard, which gives way to a chugging groove. A choir of female vocalists hoots in the distance, and Bennett\\u2019s voice rises over theirs, cajoling and cackling, as if amused by the sound he\\u2019s making and the words he\\u2019s singing. The lyrics are enigmatic: \\u201cDon\\u2019t let the facts upset you/Nobody\\u2019s out to get you/I don\\u2019t want to spoil your high/But they\\u2019ll get you by and by.\\u201d The song seems to be executing several agendas simultaneously: It\\u2019s a consolation and a threat, a party invitation, a druggie hallucination, a prophecy, a gag.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I\\u2019ve played the song dozens of times, strapping on headphones and letting the needle drop on the still pristine LP. Each time, I\\u2019m struck by the loss of Don Bennett, a singular musician who left behind so few traces, and by the disappearance in the Universal fire of an unfathomable number of other recordings, some of which may survive only on stray scraps of vinyl, many of which may no longer exist at all, in any form, anywhere. But listening to \\u201cDon\\u2019t Wanna Spoil Your High,\\u201d I\\u2019m struck also by Bennett\\u2019s uncanny presence: his gruff half-laughing voice, captured by recording-studio science in the late 1970s and still crackling with life in 2019, transmitting a message across the gulf of time and space.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI\\u2019m speaking my words of wisdom, gonna make it very clear,\\u201d Bennett sings. \\u201cBend your head right over, baby, I\\u2019ll whisper in your ear.\\u201d</p>]]'

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Remember that time when Donald Trump was going to win the Nobel Peace Prize for ending the threat of nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was almost exactly a year ago. The president was about to meet North Korea\\u2019s Kim Jong-un in Singapore. A group of House Republicans nominated the president for a Nobel Peace Prize. The crowd chanted \\u201cNo-bel!\\u201d at a Trump rally.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the end, the main achievement of the summit, a propaganda victory for North Korea, was mollifying Trump, who\\u2019d been threatening nuclear holocaust. Kim Jong-un agreed to work toward denuclearization, but as even casual news consumers know, the North Korean definition of denuclearization includes the lifting of the American nuclear umbrella over Northeast Asia. Actual North Korean concessions were minimal.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nevertheless, from the right arose a thundering, bullying demand that Trump be given credit. And a few progressives cautioned against making too much of the summit\\u2019s inadequacy, arguing, in part, that it was better for Trump to get suckered and claim victory than to lash out. Democratic critics of the summit, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/trump-kim-jong-un-summit/562934/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">wrote The Atlantic\\u2019s Peter Beinart,</a> risked becoming \\u201cde facto allies of ultra-hawks like John Bolton,\\u201d who wants to discredit diplomacy with North Korea.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a fair enough point, but also a tacit acknowledgment of the inescapable degradation of living under this president, which often feels like being stuck in a house with an unstable and abusive father. You can either placate him by humoring his delusions, or puncture them and risk unpredictable fallout. The choices are complicity or destruction.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nytimes.com/theargument?action=click&amp;module=Intentional&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Listen to \\u201cThe Argument\\u201d podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Which brings us to Trump\\u2019s recent deal \\u2014 or \\u201cdeal\\u201d \\u2014 with Mexico. Once again, Trump made a series of unhinged threats against another country, leading to high-stakes diplomacy, and the announcement of a breakthrough. Once again, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/06/08/with-mexico-deal-trump-deals-another-blow-media-elites/?utm_term=.3bad80a8238f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">chest-beating conservatives jeered</a> at Democrats for refusing to concede that Trump\\u2019s belligerence had borne fruit. Once again, when the details were revealed, it became obvious that Trump had accomplished very little of any substance. And once again, Trump has created a situation where it\\u2019s hazardous for his opponents to say too much about his incompetence.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Friday, as the clock ticked down to Trump\\u2019s threatened imposition of 5 percent tariffs on Mexican goods, the two countries announced a last-minute deal. The U.S. would hold off on imposing the levies, and Mexico would take action to deter Central American migrants. For a moment, it looked as if Trump had cowed America\\u2019s neighbor with his madman foreign policy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But giving Trump the benefit of the doubt is almost always a mistake. The president had claimed, using the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1137329348409778177" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">floridly Stalinesque language</a> we\\u2019ve all had to become accustomed to, that Mexico had agreed to \\u201cIMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!\\u201d This <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/9/18658768/mexico-us-trade-tariffs-ambassador-coqui-trump-agricultural-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">appears to be untrue</a>. In fact, as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer" title="">The New York Times reported on Saturday</a>, the deal consisted \\u201clargely of actions that Mexico had already promised to take in prior discussions with the United States.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Months ago, Mexico consented to expanding a program in which migrants seeking asylum in the United States wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated, and to deploying more of its national guard to block migrants. It looks as if negotiators of the deal made on Friday <!-- -->simply<!-- --> ramped up the scale of these agreements to give Trump a face-saving way to back down from tariffs that threatened the American economy as well as the Mexican one.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As it became clear \\u2014 at least to those outside the Fox News bubble \\u2014 how little Trump had achieved, he grew even <!-- -->more<!-- --> splutteringly incoherent than usual. \\u201cMexico was not being cooperative on the Border in things we had, or didn\\u2019t have,\\u201d until the deal, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1137697505683091461" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">he wrote in one tweet.</a> Trump went on to claim that Mexico had made <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1138030976578310144" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">further, secret concessions</a> that would be revealed at a later date, which <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/immigration-mexico-deal-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">Mexico\\u2019s foreign minister denied</a>.

What he\\u2019s good at is what might be called deal theater \\u2014 made-for-TV melodramas with self-generated crises, over-the-top demands, and suspenseful arbitrary deadlines. The point of these exercises isn\\u2019t to solve a problem, but to pacify Trump with the illusion that he is winning so that he doesn\\u2019t feel the need to break anything.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The question for everyone else is whether to play along, because Trump is less dangerous if he thinks Mexico has submitted. Until now, the president has regularly stoked his nativist base by treating the humanitarian emergency at the border as a security threat. Now he has an interest in exaggerating the degree to which the problem has been solved, just as he now plays down North Korea\\u2019s nuclear capabilities rather than admit his own failure.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facing widespread mockery for his Potemkin deal, Trump tweeted on Monday that if Mexico\\u2019s legislature fails to enact the provisions of its purported secret agreement with the U.S., the tariffs will go into effect. There\\u2019s an implicit threat here: Don\\u2019t provoke him. If he doesn\\u2019t get the headlines he wants, there\\u2019s no telling what he might do.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On June 1,<!-- --> 2019, the Daily Beast <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/we-found-shawn-brooks-the-guy-behind-the-viral-drunk-pelosi-video" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published a story</a> exposing the creator of a now infamous fake video that appeared to show House Speaker Nancy Pelosi drunkenly slurring her words. The video was created by taking a genuine clip, slowing it down, and then adjusting the pitch of her voice to disguise the manipulation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Judging by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/opinion/nancy-pelosi-video-facebook.html?module=inline" title="">social media comments</a>, many people initially fell for the fake, believing that Ms. Pelosi really was drunk while speaking to the media. (If that seems an absurd thing to believe, remember <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/fire-pizzagate-shop-reignites-conspiracy-theorists-who-find-home-facebook-n965956" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Pizzagate</a>;<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>people are happy to believe absurd things about politicians they don\\u2019t like.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The video was made by a private citizen named Shawn Brooks, who seems to have been a freelance political operative producing a wealth of pro-Trump web content. (Mr. Brooks denies creating the video, though according to the Daily Beast, Facebook confirmed he was the first to upload it.) Some commenters <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/1135176351319822338" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">quickly</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1135030189858205696" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">suggested</a><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>that the Daily Beast was wrong to expose Mr. Brooks. After all, they argued, he\\u2019s only one person, not a Russian secret agent or a powerful public relations firm; and it feels like \\u201c<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/ChuckRossDC/status/1135198139273662465" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">punching down</a>\\u201d for a major news organization to turn the spotlight on one rogue amateur. Seth Mandel, an editor at the Washington Examiner, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/SethAMandel/status/1135024852417601537" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">asked,</a> \\u201cIsn\\u2019t this like the third Daily Beast doxxing for the hell of it?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It\\u2019s a legitimate worry, but it misses an important point. There is good reason for journalists to expose the creators of fake web content, and it\\u2019s not just the glee of watching provocateurs squirm. We live in a time when knowing the origin of an internet video is just as important as knowing what it shows.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/us/politics/pelosi-doctored-video.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Related: Distorted Videos of Nancy Pelosi Spread on Facebook and Twitter, Helped by Trump]</em></a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Digital technology is making it much easier to fabricate convincing fakes. The video that Mr. Brooks created is pretty simple; you could probably do it yourself after watching a few YouTube clips about video editing. But more complicated fabrications, sometimes called <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/technology/fake-videos-deepfakes.html?module=inline" title="">\\u201cdeepfakes,\\u201d</a> use algorithmic techniques to depict people doing things they\\u2019ve never done \\u2014 not just slowing them down or changing the pitch of their voice, but making them appear to say things that they\\u2019ve never said at all. A recent <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.03658.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">research article</a><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>suggested a technique to generate full-body animations, which could effectively make digital action figures of any famous person.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, this technology doesn\\u2019t seem to have been <!-- -->used in American politics<!-- -->, though it may have played some role in a political crisis in Gabon <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/03/deepfake-gabon-ali-bongo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">earlier this year</a>. But it\\u2019s clear that current arguments about fake news are only a taste of what will happen when sounds and images, not just words, are open to manipulation by anyone with a decent computer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Combine this point with an insight from epistemology \\u2014 the branch of philosophy dealing with knowledge \\u2014 and you\\u2019ll see why the Daily Beast was right to expose the creator of the fake video of Ms. Pelosi. Contemporary philosophers rank different types of evidence according to their reliability: How much confidence, they ask, can we reasonably have in a belief when it is supported by such-and-such information?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We ordinarily tend to think that perception \\u2014 the evidence of your eyes and ears \\u2014 provides pretty strong justification. If you see something with your own eyes, you should probably believe it. By comparison, the claims that other people make \\u2014 which philosophers call \\u201ctestimony\\u201d \\u2014 provide some justification, but usually not quite as much as perception. Sometimes, of course, your senses can deceive you, but that\\u2019s less likely than other people deceiving you.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Until recently, video evidence functioned more or less like perception. Most of the time, you could trust that a camera captured roughly what you would have seen with your own eyes. So if you trust your own perception, you have nearly as much reason to trust the video. We all know that Hollywood studios, with enormous amounts of time and money, can use CGI to depict almost anything, but what are the odds that a random internet video came from Hollywood?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, with the emergence of deepfake technology, the ability to produce convincing fake video will be almost as widespread as the ability to lie. And once that happens, we ought to think of images as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/episteme/article/photographically-based-knowledge/54EABE715C54782C1A55455A3E414E94" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">more like testimony than perception</a>. In other words, you should only trust a recording if you would trust the word of the person producing it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Which means that it <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">does</em> matter where the fake Nancy Pelosi video, and others like it, come from. This time we knew the video was fake because we had access to the original. But with future deepfakes, there won\\u2019t be any original to compare them to. To know whether a disputed video is real, we\\u2019ll need to know who made it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It\\u2019s good for journalists to start getting in the habit of tracking down creators of mysterious web content. And it\\u2019s good for the rest of us to start expecting as much from the media. When deepfakes fully arrive, we\\u2019ll be glad we\\u2019ve prepared. For now, even if it\\u2019s not ideal to have amateur political operatives exposed to the ire of the internet, it\\u2019s better than carrying on as if we can still trust our lying videos.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Regina Rini (<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/rinireg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">@rinireg</a>) teaches philosophy at York University in Toronto, where she holds the Canada Research Chair in Philosophy of Moral and Social Cognition.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Now in print</em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">: \\u201cModern Ethics in 77 Arguments\\u201d and \\u201cThe Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments,\\u201d with essays from the series, edited by Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley, published by Liveright Books.</em></p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

On Monday, he pivoted back to his trade fight with China and vowed to hit Beijing with more <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">tariffs</a> if it did not accede to America\\u2019s trade demands.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe China deal\\u2019s going to work out,\\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview on CNBC. \\u201cYou know why? Because of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">tariffs.</a> Because right now China is getting absolutely decimated by companies that are leaving China, going to other countries, including our own, because they don\\u2019t want to pay the tariffs.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/us/politics/china-trade-donald-trump.html?module=inline" title="">long favored tariffs</a> as an immediate and unilateral policy tool. But his increasing confidence that the levies have helped accomplish his goals without harming the United States sets up an even more tumultuous period ahead for businesses, consumers and foreign countries.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cProtectionism shows no signs of abating, rather it is intensifying,\\u201d said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist at MFR Inc.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Markets are already counting on the Federal Reserve to come to the rescue by cutting interest rates. Fed officials <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/business/economy/powell-fed-trade-wars.html?module=inline" title="">have begun signaling</a> they are prepared to help prop up the economy to counter any slowdown from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">Mr. Trump\\u2019s trade war</a>, a development that could give the president even more leeway to carry out an aggressive trade policy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump on Monday continued to attack the Fed for raising rates last year, saying it had put the United States at a competitive disadvantage to China, which has a fairly subservient central bank. \\u201cThey devalue their currency. They have for years,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s put them at a tremendous competitive advantage, and we don\\u2019t have that advantage because we have a Fed that doesn\\u2019t lower interest rates.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president insisted his tariffs were having their intended effect \\u2014 pressuring other countries to make deals, prompting companies to move factories back to the United States and generating an enormous amount of money, all without costing American consumers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cA lot of countries have changed their habits because they know they\\u2019re next,\\u201d Mr. Trump said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said he was prepared to place 25 percent <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">tariffs</a> on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods and would do so immediately if a planned meeting with President Xi Jinping of China did not happen this month during the G-20 summit meeting in Japan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWe are scheduled to talk and meet,\\u201d Mr. Trump said during remarks to reporters at the White House. \\u201cWe always have the option to raise it another $300 billion to 25 percent.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump has blamed China for \\u201creneging\\u201d on a trade deal with the United States, and last month, he raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods as punishment. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/business/trump-trade-china.html?module=inline" title="">China has retaliated</a> by raising tariffs on about $60 billion worth of American products, like soybeans. Mr. Trump said on Monday that he saw no downside to taxing nearly everything China sends into the United States, saying it would continue to boost the American economy.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWe\\u2019ve never gotten 10 cents from China. Now we\\u2019re getting a lot of money from China, and I think that\\u2019s one of the reasons the G.D.P. was so high in the first quarter because of the tariffs that we\\u2019re taking in from China,\\u201d he said, referring to the gross domestic product, which grew about 3.1 percent in the first three months of the year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economists and business leaders <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/03/business/tariffs-trump-mexico-china.html?module=inline" title="">have rejected</a> Mr. Trump\\u2019s claims that the tariffs are doing no harm and say the trade war is slowing global growth and could ultimately trigger a recession.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Bank <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/549841559120768022/Trade-Amid-Tensions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said late last month</a> that global trade growth has slowed to its lowest level in a decade, while the International Monetary Fund warned that reciprocal tariffs between the United States and China could reduce global gross domestic product by 0.5 percent, or $455 billion, next year. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates that at their current levels, Mr. Trump\\u2019s tariffs would cost the typical American household $831 over a year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the president and his top advisers continue to disagree that import taxes \\u2014 both real and threatened \\u2014 are pinching economic growth.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI don\\u2019t think in any way that the slowdowns you\\u2019re seeing in parts of the world are a result of trade tensions at the moment,\\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/us/politics/g20-us-china-trade-war.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Falan-rappeport&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">told reporters this weekend on the sidelines of the G-20</a> meeting in Japan.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That view is unlikely to change absent a steep drop in the stock market or a pronounced slowdown in the American economy, two metrics that Mr. Trump pays close attention to.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/business/wall-street-federal-reserve-interest-rates.html?module=inline" title="">expect the Fed to act</a> before that occurs. Markets now estimate an 80 percent chance of a rate cut at or before the Fed\\u2019s July meeting, and they see a 46 percent chance of three or more .25 percentage point cuts by the end of the year.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those estimates fell, but not by much, after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/politics/trump-tariffs-mexico.html?module=inline" title="">Mr. Trump announced on Friday</a> that he had reached an immigration deal with Mexico and would suspend his tariffs, suggesting investors are accepting a rate cut as a done deal. Analysts say that the president\\u2019s willingness to use levies as a negotiating tactic for nontrade matters is helping to perpetuate uncertainty.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, Mr. Trump defended the immigration agreement with Mexico as a victory, and said unequivocally that tariffs were the vehicle that delivered it.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cIf we didn\\u2019t have tariffs, we wouldn\\u2019t have made a deal with Mexico,\\u201d the president said. \\u201cWe got everything we wanted.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was not clear what the threat of tariffs on Mexico helped the president to secure. Major terms of the deal were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html?module=inline" title="">agreed to months ago</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But last week, Mexico said it would deploy its national guard around the country, including to its southern border, and expand a program to allow asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their legal cases proceed, both actions that had been discussed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal-tariffs.html?module=inline" title="">in prior months</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States and Mexico also reached an agreement in principle to review the number of migrants crossing into the United States in 45 days and again in 90 days. If the number has not dropped sufficiently, Mr. Trump said he could impose tariffs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some said Mr. Trump\\u2019s threats toward Mexico, a close American ally, could send a message that trade wars are winnable and that the president will not back down against China.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cIt\\u2019s obvious that on a long-term perspective, President Trump is willing to effectively weaponize tariffs,\\u201d said Wen Lu, a rates strategist at TD Securities. \\u201cI think he\\u2019s almost using this as a political message to reinforce his stance against China.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president\\u2019s fondness for levies has already propelled the United States into the top echelons of tariff-wielding countries. The United States now has an overall tariff level that is more than twice as high as Canada, Britain, Italy and Germany, and even higher than emerging markets like Russia and Turkey, according to research by Torsten Slok, a chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Progress toward a trade agreement with China has stalled since early last month, and Mr. Mnuchin said over the weekend that no further talks were scheduled. The next significant meeting is expected to take place between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi in late June.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the meantime, the United States continues to prepare for the next round of Chinese tariffs. The United States trade representative will hold a hearing on June 17 to allow companies to testify about the effects of the next $300 billion worth of levies on their businesses. That round of tariffs would hit a wide range of consumer goods, including sneakers, televisions and cribs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump has also indicated he sees the fate of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that has been blacklisted from buying American technology, as a point of leverage in the trade talks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The administration <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/huawei-ban-trump.html?module=inline" title="">announced a ban</a> on Huawei\\u2019s access to American components on May 15, citing security concerns. The executive order blacklisting Huawei had actually been prepared for months, but officials held off issuing it while trade talks continued. When negotiations with the Chinese broke down at the beginning of May, a consensus emerged among top Trump administration officials to proceed with adding the company to an \\u201centity list,\\u201d according to people familiar with the matter, who declined to be named to discuss private deliberations.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, Mr. Trump said he viewed Huawei as a \\u201cthreat\\u201d but \\u201cat the same time, it could be very well that we do something with respect to Huawei as part of our trade negotiations with China.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other countries are watching the threats warily.

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">DAVENPORT, Iowa \\u2014 President Trump and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. repeatedly ripped into each other on Tuesday as unfit to lead the country as they both traveled to the battleground state of Iowa, giving voters a preview of what a general election matchup between the two men might look like.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the most ferocious day of attacks in the six-month-old presidential campaign, Mr. Trump resorted to taunts and name-calling over several hours, saying Mr. Biden was \\u201ca loser,\\u201d \\u201ca sleepy guy\\u201d and \\u201cthe weakest mentally,\\u201d and claiming that \\u201cpeople don\\u2019t respect him.\\u201d Mr. Biden took a different tack, laying out ways Mr. Trump was \\u201can existential threat\\u201d to the country, its international standing and its values.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden, who leads in early polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, also brought up subjects he had previously avoided with reporters, such as Mr. Trump siding with the North Korean state media\\u2019s insults on Mr. Biden\\u2019s I.Q.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201dHe embraces dictators like Kim Jong-un, who\\u2019s a damn murderer and a thug?\\u201d Mr. Biden said at his second event of the day, in Mount Pleasant, Iowa. \\u201cThe one thing they agree on: Joe Biden, he shouldn\\u2019t be president.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The hostile exchanges, which went back and forth across multiple Iowa campaign stops, were the clearest evidence yet that the two men see political advantages in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/trump-biden-iowa.html?module=inline" title="">waging a battle against one another</a> at this early stage of the race.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden has largely ignored his 22 Democratic rivals while building his campaign around the urgent need to oust Mr. Trump. Rather than get drawn into squabbles with more liberal candidates or lesser-known ones, he is trying to present himself as presidential material and the most electable Democrat against Mr. Trump \\u2014 particularly in swing states like Iowa, where the president trounced Hillary Clinton in 2016 after Barack Obama carried the state in 2008 and 2012.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump, mindful of polling that shows him trailing Mr. Biden in several key states, has targeted him with ridicule lately, far more than he has the other Democratic candidates. While the 2020 general election campaign is still a year away, Mr. Trump is repurposing some of his most effective ad hominem attacks from the last election.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In his remarks at an ethanol plant in Council Bluffs, for instance, Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Biden\\u2019s only message was to criticize him, and then brought up his oft-repeated insult for his 2016 opponent, Mrs. Clinton.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThat reminds me of Crooked Hillary,\\u201d Mr. Trump said, earning chuckles from the audience. \\u201cShe did the same thing. And then when it came time to vote, they all said, \\u2018You know, she doesn\\u2019t like Trump very much, but what does she stand for?\\u2019 Same thing is happening with Sleepy Joe.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While they have attacked each other from a distance, their appearances in the same state on Tuesday seemed primed to intensify the hostility. Mr. Biden wasted no time trying to frame the debate, releasing excerpts at 6 a.m. Tuesday from the remarks he had prepared to deliver at a speech in Davenport in the evening.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Throughout the day, Mr. Biden laced into Mr. Trump over a range of policy issues, such as pursuing an \\u201cerratic war on trade\\u201d and his approach to tariff negotiations, as farmers \\u2014 including in this heavily agricultural state \\u2014 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/china-tariffs-republicans.html?module=inline" title="">have struggled</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the sharpest part of Mr. Biden\\u2019s remarks in Davenport was his argument that, while the nation \\u201ccan overcome four years of this presidency,\\u201d Mr. Trump would pose an existential threat to \\u201cthe character of this nation\\u201d if he were re-elected and served another term.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He portrayed Mr. Trump\\u2019s words and actions as antithetical to the nation\\u2019s \\u201ccore values \\u2014 what we stand for, who we are, what we believe in,\\u201d citing the president\\u2019s child separation policy at the southern border and referencing his remark that there were \\u201cvery fine people on both sides\\u201d of the white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Va.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden also argued that Mr. Trump was a threat to \\u201cour standing in the world,\\u201d noting that the president has attacked NATO while embracing President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and saying he had shown poor character by using \\u201ccrude language\\u201d and \\u201cembarrassing behavior that is burrowing deep into our culture.\\u201d And he said Mr. Trump was undermining American democracy by criticizing law enforcement agencies, defying the authority of Congress and using phrases like \\u201cenemy of the people\\u201d to describe a free press.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cIn 2020, we not only have to repudiate Donald Trump\\u2019s policies and values \\u2014 we have to clearly and fully reject, for our own safety\\u2019s sake, his view of the presidency,\\u201d Mr. Biden said. \\u201cQuote: \\u2018I have complete power.\\u2019 No you don\\u2019t, Donald Trump.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201c\\u2018Only I can fix it.\\u2019 Fix yourself first,\\u201d Mr. Biden said as the crowd enthusiastically drowned him out.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The early excerpts from Mr. Biden\\u2019s remarks received prominent attention in the news media on Tuesday morning. Mr. Trump, as he departed the Oval Office, told reporters that he thought Mr. Biden was \\u201ca loser\\u201d and questioned his mental fitness.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI\\u2019d rather run against, I think, Biden than anybody,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think he\\u2019s the weakest mentally, and I like running against people that are weak mentally. I think Joe is the weakest up here. The other ones have much more energy.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After arriving in Council Bluffs, Mr. Trump hinted that he was waiting until his kickoff rally on June 18 in Orlando for his official \\u201cpolitical season\\u201d to begin. But he couldn\\u2019t help but take glancing blows at Mr. Biden in between touting the low unemployment rate and the boom in blue-collar jobs. \\u201cHe was someplace in Iowa today and he said my name so many times that people couldn\\u2019t stand it anymore,\\u201d Mr. Trump said. \\u201c\\u2018No, don\\u2019t keep saying it.\\u2019 Sleepy guy.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Later, Mr. Trump noted that America \\u201cwould never be treated with respect\\u201d under Mr. Biden\\u2019s leadership, \\u201cbecause people don\\u2019t respect him.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The attacks by Mr. Trump were, in one way, a boost for Mr. Biden after days of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/us/politics/biden-abortion-hyde-amendment.html?module=inline" title="">Democratic criticism over his shifting stances</a> on federal funding for abortion. On Tuesday, there was wall-to-wall cable news coverage of the Trump-Biden feud, not of abortion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden, responding to reporters\\u2019 questions in Iowa after Mr. Trump\\u2019s attacks, laughed off the president\\u2019s remarks about his stamina and mental fitness, and repeated his past statements that voters have a right to question all of the candidates\\u2019 ages.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cLook at him and look at me and answer the question,\\u201d Mr. Biden said, when one reporter raised those comments. \\u201cIt\\u2019s self-evident, you know it\\u2019s a ridiculous assertion on his part.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pressed specifically on Mr. Trump\\u2019s remark that Mr. Biden is \\u201cweak mentally,\\u201d the former vice president laughed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to stoop down to where he is,\\u201d he said.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden\\u2019s face-off against Mr. Trump on Tuesday could have downsides, some Democratic strategists cautioned.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe Biden campaign clearly seems to relish sparring with Trump. In their minds, they believe it elevates him above the rest of the Democratic field,\\u201d said Brian Fallon, who served as press secretary for Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s 2016 campaign. \\u201cThe potential downside is that, as Trump road tests different attacks on Biden, it may help the Democratic primary electorate better visualize potential vulnerabilities that Biden would have in a general election.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Fallon said that if any of those attacks \\u2014 from his supposed lack of energy to his support for the 1994 crime bill \\u2014 changed voter perceptions, \\u201cthat could erode the aura of electability that is right now Biden\\u2019s strongest asset.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday night, Mr. Trump skipped over Mr. Biden and focused on painting top Democrats as socialists. In a red-meat speech to a red-cap-wearing crowd of 700 Iowa Republicans in West Des Moines, Mr. Trump argued, without evidence, that the United States could tumble into a state of decline like Venezuela under the wrong leadership. He notably name-checked Senator Bernie Sanders, who is set to give a speech on democratic socialism on Wednesday.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cMore than 100 Democrats have signed up for the Bernie Sanders government takeover of health care,\\u201d Mr. Trump said of Mr. Sanders\\u2019s \\u201cMedicare for all\\u201d plan. \\u201cWe have 180 million Americans having great private health care. That would all be taken away. Democrats also support the $100 trillion Green New Deal, how about that beauty.\\u201d Making an oblique reference to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Trump said the bill was \\u201cmade up by a young woman, who is, well, let\\u2019s see how she works out.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Public and private polls that show Mr. Trump trailing Mr. Biden in critical states have contributed to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/us/politics/trump-biden-iowa.html?module=inline" title="">his preoccupation with Mr. Biden</a>, whom the president has told aides to describe as old and feeble (Mr. Biden is 76; Mr. Trump will turn 73 this week).</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Up to this point, Mr. Biden has largely resisted responding to Mr. Trump\\u2019s individual broadsides, insisting repeatedly that he wants to avoid a \\u201cmud-wrestling match\\u201d with the president and often ignoring shouted questions from reporters about Mr. Trump\\u2019s remarks.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But that hardly means Mr. Biden avoids discussing Mr. Trump. He is centering his campaign squarely on defeating the president, calling him an \\u201caberration.\\u201d It is a point of emphasis <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/us/politics/biden-trump-republicans-2020.html?module=inline" title="">sharply at odds with several of his Democratic opponents</a>, who believe Trumpism has redefined the Republican Party and say the country needs bigger, structural change that goes beyond defeating one man.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At every turn, Mr. Biden is seeking to keep the focus on a possible general election matchup between himself and Mr. Trump. He has recently visited Pennsylvania and Ohio, important general election swing states, arguing that he is able to connect in the industrial Midwest and torching Mr. Trump\\u2019s leadership approach.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While many of the voters who filed into his Ottumwa event shared Mr. Biden\\u2019s near-single-minded focus on Mr. Trump, praising Mr. Biden as someone who could appeal to moderates and independents, Cheri Scherr, 63, said she had hoped to hear \\u201cmore about his ideas.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI wish he would talk less about Trump,\\u201d said Ms. Scherr, of Pella, Iowa. \\u201cWe\\u2019re Democrats, we know why we don\\u2019t like Trump.\\u201d</p>]]'

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If the triumph of Trumpism is the most important recent development in American political history, then the second most important is the mobilization of liberal and left-wing voters to challenge the president\\u2019s authoritarian politics.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This mobilization drove the Women\\u2019s March, where a day after Trump\\u2019s inauguration, hundreds of thousands came to Washington to protest against his nascent administration.

But I think there\\u2019s a deeper divide, between a politics that sees the grass roots as an asset to use and cultivate versus one that treats it as a complication to manage. It\\u2019s a \\u201cleader knows best\\u201d approach that may squander the Democratic Party\\u2019s advantage of enthusiasm and drive against a corrupt and unpopular president. It even seems as though for Democrats like Pelosi, the only political actions that truly matter are either in the legislature or at the ballot box. It\\u2019s an understandable view for a leadership class whose political memories stretch back to the devastating Democratic losses of 1968 and 1972 (to say nothing of 1980 and 1984). But <!-- -->it\\u2019s also bred of a deep aversion <!-- -->to risk-taking, even when circumstances warrant bold action.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If the Trump era has revealed anything about the state of American politics, it\\u2019s that the realm of possibility is far greater than previously recognized. There are still limits and obstacles, but there are also opportunities to fundamentally shift the terms of political conflict and debate. There are Democrats outside of the grass roots who understand this and have adopted a tactical and strategic boldness that suits the moment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Backed by the base of the party, liberal candidates like Doug Jones in Alabama and Stacey Abrams in Georgia have run aggressive campaigns in ostensibly hostile territory, making unheard-of gains in the process. Presidential contenders like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have aimed their campaigns at that grass-roots sense of possibility with expansive policy programs and a transformative vision. Exemplified by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, younger lawmakers are speaking to and amplifying the grass roots, building powerful public platforms in the process. But Democratic leaders in Congress remain skeptical, seemingly stuck in an era when Democrats were on the defensive and backlash politics ruled the day.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then again, Pelosi and Schumer are shrewd politicians with decades of experience. Perhaps their resistance to grass-roots Democrats, and to impeachment in particular, will pay dividends. But we should consider the reverse as well: that a Democratic Party that plays with excessive caution \\u2014 and keeps its base at a distance \\u2014 is one that might demobilize its voters and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/obama-trump-voters-democrats.html?module=inline" title="">produce the same conditions</a> that helped Trump win in the first place.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.

But Sudan\\u2019s uprising against Mr. al-Bashir is an uprising against political Islamists; the protest leaders who have been negotiating with the military council are not Islamists. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are instead driven by their own <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/05/saudi-arabia-sudan-uprising-omar-al-bashir" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">fear</a> that should a major Arab country transition to democracy, it would lead to upheavals at home.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With Sudan\\u2019s Arab neighbors under Saudi and Emirati sway, with the United States doing little beyond expressing concern, it has fallen to Ethiopia\\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, to take the lead in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/06/07/world/africa/07reuters-sudan-politics.html?searchResultPosition=5&amp;module=inline" title="">mediation</a> between the military council and the opposition.

And the reactions played out like a preview of the divisions the party could face in presidential politics and a key Senate race in 2020.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Arizona\\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, a proxy for the Republican establishment, predicted devastation if<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title=""> tariffs</a> were placed on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/trump-mexico-deal.html?module=inline" title="">Mexican imports</a> such as fruits and vegetables.

She will probably be on the ballot again in 2020, likely facing Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, in one of the decisive races for Senate control.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A factor that some Republicans fear could further alienate independents in both the presidential and Senate races is the resurgence of the far-right fringe in Arizona, which Mr. McCain had fought to marginalize.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In January, the hard right elected as state Republican chairwoman Kelli Ward, whom national Republicans have attacked as a conspiracy theorist.

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It would be a mistake to call Robert Menasse\\u2019s melancholy and satirical \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d a great food novel. It has a lot more on its mind than breakfasts, lunches and dinners.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But it opens, after a prologue, with a question \\u2014 \\u201cWho invented mustard?\\u201d \\u2014 and takes off from there. By the next page, the author is describing \\u201cstaring at mustard on a plate while a sausage burns in the frying pan as a clear and typical symptom of depression.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Menasse\\u2019s roomy novel is set in contemporary Brussels, and its characters can often be found consuming throwback comfort foods like <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">stoemp</em>, a sausage and potato dish, and impenetrable stews such as <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">waterzooi</em> and <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">bigos</em>, and sighing with happiness. A lot of cigarettes are lit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It would be a mistake, too, to call \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d a great novel of the European Union, though some have tried. (The book has received deservingly rapturous reviews abroad.) Menasse\\u2019s novel is in part about bureaucratic infighting at the E.U., a subject he manages to make not just interesting but drolly comic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Make no mistake: The author admires this institution and the notion of pushing past the nationalism that has tilted the world toward racism and war. But he can\\u2019t help but satirize the vanities of his career-minded characters, with their little wheelie suitcases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If you tasked an excellent writer with turning a tall stack of recent issues of The Economist into a novel, you might get \\u201cThe Capital.\\u201d Somehow I mean this as high praise.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Born in 1954, Menasse is Austrian and well-known in Europe. He\\u2019s published many books of fiction and nonfiction, and has received dozens of accolades. Few of his books have been translated into English, however. This is a situation, I predict, that will soon change.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Perhaps what we have in \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d is a great murder mystery. The book opens with an assassination in a hotel, a murky, John le Carr\\xe9-world sort of event.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It\\u2019s an unusual murder story, though, because the suspense lies not in discovering the identity of the assassin (we follow him as he goes on the lam) but the identity of the dead man. You come to suspect that the murder is a kind of MacGuffin, that maybe it doesn\\u2019t matter at all.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I enjoyed \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d so much that I could keep going like this. It\\u2019s possible this is a great Holocaust-minded novel for a new millennium. Some of its characters are survivors of Auschwitz; others visit it. Still others think long and hard about the meanings to which the camp can be put as a symbol of the need for overcoming national sentiment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One survivor meets yet another young person with a shaved head and tattoos and loses his cool. \\u201cDid they know what they were doing, what they were expressing, what associations they were evoking?\\u201d He thinks: \\u201cYou\\u2019re insulting the world\\u2019s memory!\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the end I think \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d may be a major book about coincidences, of linked and overlapping meanings. G.K. Chesterton thought of coincidences as \\u201cspiritual puns.\\u201d For Menasse they have similar meaning. In this Balzac-like novel, he introduces us to a dozen or so characters \\u2014 bureaucrats, police inspectors, academics, lobbyists \\u2014 and spins them around one another. Their lives intersect and chime in resonant ways.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of these characters is Fenia Xenopoulou, a Greek woman turning 40 who has been given a job with no clout and almost no budget, as head of communications for the Directorate-General for Culture. She needs to get out. She kisses up, sleeping with a powerful colleague, and kicks down, ordering one of her subordinates, a sympathetic man named Martin Susman, to come up with an idea to help her consolidate her power.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We meet an economist, Grace Atkinson, who hopes to escape the blame when Martin\\u2019s idea goes awry. A police inspector, \\xc9mile Brunfaut, pushes back against a political cover-up of the hotel murder. An aging Austrian academic named Alois Erhart tells difficult truths about European nationalism, truths no one wants to hear.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Alois reminds us that everything is getting worse. The nature of truth has been degraded. Tabloids stir up base instincts and abet the rise of heinous old ghosts. \\u201cHe had been prepared for everything,\\u201d we read, in a line made for the age of Donald Trump, \\u201cbut not everything in caricature.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The heavy tourism in Brussels weighs on everyone, too. About \\xc9mile, the police inspector, Menasse writes: \\u201cBack in 1914, his grandfather had said, Brussels was the richest and most beautiful city in the world \\u2014 then they came three times, twice in their boots with rifles, the third time in their trainers with cameras.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is a deeply humane novel, a novel for adults. It carries the wisdom and weight and weariness of late middle age. Menasse writes not about the way things should be but about the way things are, rare enough these days.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The translation, by Jamie Bulloch, is adroit. Yet \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d made me want to learn to read in German, where it is surely even better.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is a baggy book, with room for everything Menasse wants to put into it. It has its share of longueurs. But there is also pointed writing not just about politics but about subways and orgasms and woolly underwear and air conditioning and retirement homes. You will learn a surprising amount about European pork production.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">W.H. Auden lamented, near the end of his life, that nothing he wrote saved a single Jew from the ovens. It\\u2019s hard to reckon with the political impact a book like \\u201cThe Capital\\u201d might have. I suspect it will be nil.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But this novel evidences a sharp awareness of the forces remaking European life, with Brexit as only one example. Ties are coming apart. To borrow a line from Ali Smith\\u2019s recent novel, \\u201cSpring,\\u201d \\u201cHow\\u2019re you doing, apart from the end of liberal capitalist democracy?\\u201d</p>]]'

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Someone broke into a church in Centerville, Utah, last November and attacked the organist who was practicing there. In March, after a conventional investigation came up empty, a police detective turned to forensic consultants at Parabon NanoLabs. Using the publicly accessible website GEDmatch, the consultants found a likely distant genetic relative of the suspect, whose blood sample had been found near the church\\u2019s broken window.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Someone related to the person on GEDmatch did indeed live in Centerville: a 17-year-old high school student. Alerted by the police, a school resource officer watched the student during lunch at the school cafeteria and<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900070489/plastic-milk-container-genealogy-helped-utah-police-crack-church-assault-case.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> collected the milk carton and juice box</a> he\\u2019d thrown in the garbage. The DNA on the trash was a match for the crime scene evidence. This appears to be the<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/genetic-genealogy-parabon-gedmatch-assault" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> first time</a> that this technique was used for an assault investigation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The technique is known as genetic genealogy. It isn\\u2019t simply a matter of finding an identical genetic match between someone in a database and evidence from a crime scene. Instead, a DNA profile may offer an initial clue \\u2014 that a distant cousin is related to a suspect, for instance \\u2014 and then an examination of birth records, family trees and newspaper clips can identify a small number of people for further investigation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The identification of Joseph DeAngelo in the Golden State Killer case also relied on genetic genealogy. He was charged with<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/golden-state-killer-dna.html?module=inline" title=""> 26 counts of murder and kidnapping</a> after a genealogist helped investigators in California identify a third cousin of Mr. DeAngelo\\u2019s through GEDmatch and other genealogical records.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While there may be broad public support for a technique that solved serial murders, just because technology allows for a new type of investigation doesn\\u2019t mean the government should be allowed to use it in all cases.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Genetic genealogy requires lots of DNA samples and an easy way to compare them. Americans have created millions of genetic profiles already. A 2018 study published in Science predicted that<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/science/science-genetic-genealogy-study.html?module=inline" title=""> 90 percent of Americans of European descent</a> will be identifiable from their DNA within a year or two, even if they have not used a consumer DNA service. As for easy access, GEDmatch\\u2019s website provides exactly this opportunity. Consumers can take profiles generated from other commercial genetic testing services, upload them free and compare them to other profiles. So can the police.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[If you use technology, someone is using your information. We\\u2019ll tell you how \\u2014 and what you can do about it. </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/privacy-project?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up for our limited-run newsletter</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We should be glad whenever a cold case involving a serious crimes like <!-- -->rape or murder<!-- --> can be solved. But the use of genetic genealogy in the Centerville assault case raises with new urgency fundamental questions about this technique.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">First, there is now no downward limit on what crimes the police might investigate through genetic genealogy. If the police felt free to use it in an assault case, why not shoplifting, trespassing or littering? </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Second, there\\u2019s the issue of meaningful consent. You may decide that the police should use your DNA profile without qualification and may even post your information online with that purpose in mind. But your DNA is also shared in part with your relatives. When you consent to genetic sleuthing, you are also exposing your siblings, parents, cousins, relatives you\\u2019ve never met and even future generations of your family. Legitimate consent to the government\\u2019s use of an entire family tree should involve more than just a single person clicking \\u201cyes\\u201d to a website\\u2019s terms and conditions.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Third, there\\u2019s the question of why the limits on Americans\\u2019 genetic privacy are being fashioned by private entities. The Centerville police used GEDmatch because the site owners allowed an exception to their own rules, which had permitted law enforcement access only for murder and sexual assault investigations. After user complaints, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.gedmatch.com/tos.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">GEDmatch expanded the list of crimes</a> that the police may investigate on its site to include assault. It also changed default options for users so that the police may not gain access to their profiles unless users affirmatively opt-in. But if your relative elects to do so, there\\u2019s no way for you to opt out of that particular decision. And what\\u2019s to stop GEDmatch from changing its policies again?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finally, the police usually confirm leads by collecting discarded DNA samples from a suspect. How comfortable should we be that a school resource officer hung around a high school cafeteria waiting to collect a teenager\\u2019s \\u201cabandoned\\u201d <!-- -->DNA<!-- -->?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All of these issues point to one problem: Police use of genetic genealogy is virtually unregulated. Law enforcement agencies and cooperating genetic genealogy websites are operating in a world of few limits. There are not only few rules about which crimes to investigate, but also unclear remedies in the case of mistakes, the discovery of embarrassing or intrusive information, or misuse of the information. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If these concerns sounds similar to other technology and privacy problems we\\u2019re facing, they should. Our genetic and digital identities raise similar questions of autonomy, civil liberties, and intrusion by public and private entities.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Without legal limits, genetic genealogy will become a more popular tool for the police. Rather than wait for the courts to deal with difficult and novel issues about genetic surveillance and privacy, state legislatures and attorneys general should step in and articulate guidelines on how far their law enforcement agencies should go. Congress and the Federal Trade Commission should take further steps to protect the privacy and security of consumer genetic data. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If the police are to be given unlimited access to the genetic information of your entire family tree, they should have it at the end of a public debate, not by default.</p>, <p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Elizabeth Joh is a professor of criminal law and procedure, constitutional law and policing at the University of California, Davis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

After trying to douse it with foam retardant and water from a nearby lake, emergency personnel decided to dismantle the warehouse containing the vault to more easily put out the fire.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Musicians </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/universal-music-fire-musician-reactions.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">mourned the fiery destruction</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> of their recordings.]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Almost all of the master recordings stored in the vault were destroyed in the fire, including those produced by some of the most famous musicians since the 1940s. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a confidential report in 2009, Universal Music Group estimated the loss at about 500,000 song titles.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The lost works most likely included masters in the Decca Records collection by Billie Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson, Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald and Judy Garland. The fire probably also claimed some of Chuck Berry\\u2019s greatest recordings, produced for Chess Records, as well as the masters of some of Aretha Franklin\\u2019s first appearances on record.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Almost of all of Buddy Holly\\u2019s masters were lost, as were most of John Coltrane\\u2019s masters in the Impulse Records collection. The fire also claimed numerous hit singles, likely including Bill Haley and His Comets\\u2019 \\u201cRock Around the Clock,\\u201d Etta James\\u2019s \\u201cAt Last\\u201d and the Kingsmen\\u2019s \\u201cLouie Louie.\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The list of artists affected spans decades of popular music. It includes recordings by Ray Charles, B.B. King, the Four Tops, Joan Baez, Neil Diamond, Sonny and Cher, Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Al Green, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Buffett, the Eagles, Aerosmith, Rufus and Chaka Khan, Barry White, Patti LaBelle, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Police, Sting, Steve Earle, R.E.M., Janet Jackson, Guns N\\u2019 Roses, Mary J. Blige, No Doubt, Nine Inch Nails, Snoop Dogg, Nirvana, Beck, Sheryl Crow, Tupac Shakur, Eminem, 50 Cent and the Roots.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A master recording is the one-of-a-kind original recording of a piece of music. <!-- -->It\\u2019s the source from which other vinyl records, CDs, MP3s and all other recordings are made. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to the article, documents show that the vault contained masters dating back decades, including multitrack recordings on which individual instruments remained isolated from one another. There were also session masters, including recordings that had never been commercially released. The recordings within the vault came from to some of the most important record labels of all time<!-- -->.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Audiophiles and audio professionals view such recordings with special regard.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cA master is the truest capture of a piece of recorded music,\\u201d Adam Block, the former president of Legacy Recordings, Sony Music Entertainment\\u2019s catalog arm, told the magazine. \\u201cSonically, masters can be stunning in their capturing of an event in time. Every copy thereafter is a sonic step away.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the time, the fire made news around the world, and the vault featured heavily in that coverage. But most articles focused only on the video recordings in the archive and, even then, news outlets largely characterized the disaster as a crisis averted.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jody Rosen, the writer of the article, described the successful effort to play down the scope of the loss as a \\u201ctriumph of crisis management\\u201d that involved officials working for Universal Music Group on both coasts. Those efforts were undoubtedly aimed at minimizing public embarrassment, but some suggest the company was also particularly worried about a backlash from artists and artist estates whose master recordings had been destroyed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The real extent of the loss was laid out in litigation and company documents obtained by Mr. Rosen, a contributing writer for the magazine. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Rosen described the loss as historic, and even Universal Music Group itself \\u2014 privately \\u2014 viewed what happened in bleak terms: \\u201cLost in the fire was, undoubtedly, a huge musical heritage,\\u201d reads one 2009 internal assessment.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Record companies have had a troubled history with such recordings and have been known to trash them in bulk. Decades ago, employees of CBS Records reportedly took power saws to multitrack masters to sell the reels as scrap metal. In the 1970s, RCA destroyed masters by Elvis Presley in a broader purge.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because of that history, industry professionals have long questioned how committed the major music labels are to preserving what they see as priceless artifacts. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today, most commercial recordings from the past century and beyond are controlled by only three giant record companies: Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and, of course, Universal Music Group.</p>]]'

Pritzker took over as the governor of Illinois this year, Democratic lawmakers, who had spent four years at an impasse with his Republican predecessor, vowed that their party\\u2019s new grip on the State Capitol would bring immediate change.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The pace has been startling. In recent months, Illinois legislators have moved sharply to the left, deeming abortion a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/101/SB/10100SB0025ham001.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">fundamental right</a> for women no matter what the Supreme Court might decide, raising the minimum wage, taking steps to legalize recreational marijuana and introducing a graduated income tax.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some 700 miles to the south, the Alabama State Capitol, dominated by Republicans, has raced in the opposite direction.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Alabama lawmakers voted during this term to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/abortion-law-alabama.html?module=inline" title="">ban most abortions</a>. They <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/SB69/2019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">eliminated marriage licenses</a>, so that probate judges opposed to same-sex marriage would not have to sign marriage certificates.

Kay Ivey of Alabama, a fellow Republican, earlier signed the abortion and marriage license bills, and on Monday her office announced that she had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/chemical-castration-alabama.html?module=inline" title="">signed the castration legislation</a>.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Read about what </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/us/politics/chemical-castration-alabama.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">chemical castration means in Alabama</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.]</em></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is the first time in more than a century that all but one state legislature is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/ncslorg/status/1060137062853160961?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">dominated by a single party</a>. Most legislative sessions have ended or are scheduled to end in a matter of days in capitals across the nation, and Republican-held states have rushed forward with conservative agendas as those controlled by Democrats have pushed through liberal ones.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Any hope that single-party control in the states might ease the tone of political discourse has not borne out. Lopsided party dominance has not brought resignation; instead of minority parties conceding that they lack the numbers to effectively fight back, the mood has grown more tense and vitriolic.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe whole nation is speaking about how divisive we are,\\u201d Thomas Jackson, a Democrat in the Alabama House of Representatives, told colleagues during a contentious meeting last month.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Oregon, where Democrats control state government, Republicans <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-republican-senate-shutdown-education-funding-vote/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">boycotted </a>sessions for several days over disagreements about taxes and gun control. In Tennessee, where Republicans are in charge, Democrats staged a walkout during a heated and chaotic budget debate, and Republicans <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/02/tennessee-general-assembly-final-days-111-th-legislative-session-house-senate-republicans-democrats/3615928002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ordered the police</a> to go find them.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In New York, the State Legislature passed several laws that had been blocked in previous years by Republicans, who lost control of the Senate earlier this year after a decade in power. Those measures included a law <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/nyregion/child-sex-abuse-victims.html?module=inline" title="">extending the period of time</a> for victims of childhood sexual abuse to file lawsuits, and several others <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/nyregion/gun-laws-new-york.html?module=inline" title="">restricting the use of firearms</a>, including bans on bump stocks and teachers carrying guns in schools.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And in Colorado, where Democrats dominate in the capital, Republicans were so upset about the stream of new laws being passed that they demanded each bill be read aloud to slow the pace. Democrats responded by having five computers <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/samuelbrasch/status/1105211490938716160/video/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">simultaneously \\u201cread\\u201d bills</a>.

They won in court, but Democrats went on \\u2014 at a moderated pace \\u2014 to pass legislation that many Republicans opposed, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb18-1274" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reducing greenhouse gas emissions</a>, banning <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/us/gay-conversion-therapy-colorado.html?module=inline" title="">gay conversion therapy</a> for minors and creating a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2019A/bills/2019a_1168_ren.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reinsurance program</a> to lower health care costs.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This year was always <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/democrats-gun-control-healthcare.html?module=inline" title="">poised to be contentious</a> in statehouses. Across the nation, nearly 1,700 new lawmakers won seats in last fall\\u2019s elections. The vast majority of the newcomers were Democrats, who won control of six new legislative chambers, meaning that they now dominate both chambers in 18 states. But Republicans continue to control the majority of state legislatures, with 29. (Two states, Nebraska and Alaska, do not easily fit the model, although both are also dominated by Republicans.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Analysts said that issues addressed by state legislatures this year, which included <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/80th2019/Bill/6174/Overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">gun control</a>, health care, education and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB392" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">police procedures</a>, might have more immediate, lasting effect than anything approved in Washington, D.C., where government is divided.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The roots of the polarization in state legislatures can be traced to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ballotpedia.org/State_legislative_elections,_2010" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">elections in 2010</a>, when Republicans made decisive gains in statehouses and pressed for policies that included restricting labor unions and abortion access, while expanding gun rights, according to Sarah F. Anzia, a political scientist at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Around the same time, Dr. Anzia said, national organizations representing interest groups ranging from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.aft.org/action/election-2018" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">teachers</a> to gun owners became more active in state capitals, because they found it far easier to make headway in places like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nraila.org/legal-legislation/state-legislation/california/2019/february-2019-litigation-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Sacramento</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wvea.org/content/tax-reform-committee-updated-june-15-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Charleston, W.Va., </a>than in Washington because of gridlock in Congress.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The number of states with either supermajorities of Democrats that also have Democratic governors (California, Nevada and Oregon, among others) or Republicans with Republican governors (Alabama, Ohio and Tennessee, among others) has grown, too, meaning that many lawmakers rarely feel the need to compromise.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cIf you are a Republican in one state, you are probably going to be pushing the same agenda as a Republican in another state, and the same is true for Democrats,\\u201d said Dr. Anzia. \\u201cThat hasn\\u2019t always been true, and the result is that now more than ever, state legislatures are key players in these partisan battles over politics.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Minnesota, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/democrats-gun-control-healthcare.html?module=inline" title="">only state </a>left with a divided legislature, promises of bipartisanship sometimes devolved into stalemate.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During a budget standoff last month, Tim Walz, the Democratic governor who campaigned last year on a pledge to work across the aisle, angrily denounced Republicans for blocking gun control efforts and supporting deep tax cuts, saying those policies \\u201cfit better in Mississippi and Alabama than they do in Minnesota.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ultimately, Democrats could win neither new gun laws nor new tax increases, and Republicans also failed to win approval for the bulk of their agenda.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, once the session ended last month, Governor Walz said that \\u201cMinnesota is showing the rest of the nation that Republicans and Democrats can still find compromise and work together to get things done,\\u201d citing spending increases for public education and efforts to fight opioid addiction.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Alabama and Illinois \\u2014 one overwhelmingly red, the other blue \\u2014 were more representative of this year\\u2019s tone, providing perhaps the best examples of political parties moving to enact utterly different agendas.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After Alabama <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/abortion-law-alabama.html?module=inline" title=""> effectively banned abortion</a> last month, female lawmakers in Illinois responded almost immediately, pressing through a bill expanding abortion rights in their state. (Abortion rights groups have sued to stop the Alabama law from taking effect.) And while Illinois voted to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/BillStatus.asp?DocTypeID=SB&amp;DocNum=3432&amp;GAID=14&amp;SessionID=91&amp;LegID=111418" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">allow sports betting</a> and to legalize recreational marijuana, Alabama failed to approve either a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://legiscan.com/AL/bill/SB220/2019" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">state lottery</a> or medical marijuana.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was Alabama\\u2019s abortion measure, the strictest in the nation, that sparked the most contentious debate of any legislation this session.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During debates in the Legislature, Rolanda Hollis, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, read a poem to colleagues called <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/if-my-vagina-was-gun-revives-tradition-protest-poetry/313217/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">\\u201cIf My Vagina Was a Gun\\u201d</a> that she said illustrated Alabama\\u2019s consistent protection of Second Amendment rights but not abortion rights.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bobby Singleton, a Senate Democrat, told his Republican colleagues that they had \\u201caborted\\u201d and \\u201craped\\u201d Alabama by supporting the legislation, which was approved generally along party lines.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Terry Lathan, the chair of the Alabama Republican Party, downplayed the uproar over the abortion bill, saying she had seen worse \\u2014 including when a Republican senator <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knXgcd_iAUg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">punched</a> a Democratic colleague on the Senate floor in 2007.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThis is the political arena,\\u201d she said. \\u201cEveryone needs to put on their big girl and boy pants. I mean, come on!\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Illinois, Republicans were in much the same position as Democrats in Alabama: Outnumbered and outflanked. And like Alabama Democrats, Illinois Republicans lost nearly every vote of significance.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to voting to raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2025, the state legislature became the first in the nation to pass a bill legalizing both the sale and possession of marijuana. (In other states, voters have approved such laws through ballot initiatives.)</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dale Righter, a Republican in the Illinois Senate, said that without power, Republicans\\u2019 hopes relied on conservative Democratic voters deciding that their lawmakers had gone too far.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI have no doubt that there are Democratic voters saying, \\u2018Hey, this isn\\u2019t what I signed up for,\\u2019\\u201d he said.</p>]]'

The player who had scored more goals than any other, male or female, in international competition described standing onstage at the ESPYs the year after she retired in 2015, receiving the Icon Award alongside two peers, Peyton Manning and Kobe Bryant. \\u201cI felt so grateful,\\u201d she recalled. \\u201cI had a momentary feeling of having arrived; like, we women had finally made it.\\u201d As the athletes exited the stage, each having, as Wambach put it, \\u201cleft it all on the field for decades with the same ferocity, talent and commitment,\\u201d it occurred to her that while the sacrifices the men made for their careers were nearly identical to her own, their new lives would not resemble hers in one fundamental way. \\u201cKobe and Peyton walked away from their careers with something I didn\\u2019t have: enormous bank accounts,\\u201d Wambach said. \\u201cBecause of that, they had something else I didn\\u2019t have: freedom. Their hustling days were over; mine were just beginning.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States women\\u2019s national team is the best in the world and has been for decades. Since the FIFA Women\\u2019s World Cup was inaugurated in 1991, the United States has won three of the seven titles, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/sports/soccer/womens-world-cup-usa-defeats-japan-to-win-title.html?searchResultPosition=4&amp;module=inline" title="">including the most recent one in 2015</a>. Since women\\u2019s soccer became an Olympic sport in 1996, it has won four of six gold medals. The team has been ranked No.1 by FIFA for 10 of the last 11 years and has produced some of the biggest female sports stars of the last several decades, from Mia Hamm to Wambach to the current starting center forward, Alex Morgan. The squad playing at the World Cup this month in France includes Morgan; her accomplice on the left wing, the Tilda Swinton doppelg\\xe4nger Megan Rapinoe; and the previous World Cup\\u2019s hat-trick-scoring hero, Carli Lloyd; along with newcomers like the elegant but deadly Mallory Pugh and the ingenious, bruising midfielder Lindsey Horan. The American team is favored to successfully defend its title, despite a field of opponents whose depth, fitness and all-around sophistication improved drastically even in the past four years, reflecting the rapid growth of women\\u2019s soccer globally. \\u201cThis is the first World Cup where I feel like \\u2014 and I\\u2019m rejoicing over this \\u2014 I can count potential World Cup winners on more than one hand,\\u201d the former player and current ESPN commentator Julie Foudy said when calling a recent match between the United States and Mexico.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was particularly important, then, in the months leading up to this moment, for the American women to keep their focus, minimize distractions and avoid drama at all costs. Which they did, with one enormous exception. On March 8, they <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/08/sports/womens-soccer-team-lawsuit-gender-discrimination.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline" title="">sued the United States Soccer Federation</a>, claiming \\u201cpurposeful gender discrimination.\\u201d \\u201cThe bottom line is simple,\\u201d the star defender Becky Sauerbrunn said in a statement. \\u201cIt is wrong for us to be paid and valued less for our work because of our gender.\\u201d Rapinoe, also in a statement, mentioned the responsibility the team feels to advocate \\u201con behalf of our teammates, future teammates, fellow women athletes and women all around the world.\\u201d This was 95 days before the team\\u2019s first World Cup match in France and mere weeks before the beginning of its next training camp \\u2014 a weeklong blend of intense practice and tryouts aimed at enabling Coach Jill Ellis and her staff to get the alchemy just right. But the players felt they could not wait. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t always want to be patient,\\u201d Morgan tells me. \\u201cYou have to seize the moment.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/magazine/why-is-us-womens-soccer-still-fighting-to-exist.html?module=inline"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/magazine/why-is-us-womens-soccer-still-fighting-to-exist.html" title="">[Why is U.S. women\\u2019s soccer still fighting to exist?]</a></a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The lawsuit\\u2019s timing may be dramatic, but it was the natural next step in a continuing dispute that centers on equal compensation. Members of the U.S.W.N.T. have been pursuing fair compensation for years, with only marginal improvement: The lawsuit asserts, for example, that from 2013 to 2016, if a male and a female national team player each played 20 exhibition games in a year, members of the men\\u2019s squad would have earned an average of $263,320, while members of the women\\u2019s squad would have earned a maximum of $99,000. The suit also claims that \\u201cduring the period relevant to this case,\\u201d the women\\u2019s team earned more for U.S. Soccer than the men\\u2019s team did. It cites numbers from the 2016 fiscal year that indicate that the federation had expected a combined net loss for the national teams of $429,929, but that largely because of the women\\u2019s team\\u2019s successes it revised its projections to a $17.7 million profit.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a response filed on May 7, U.S. Soccer denies many of the specifics provided in the lawsuit, including those mentioned above, but it doesn\\u2019t dispute that the men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s players are not paid equally. Instead, it asserts that those inequities are a result of \\u201cdifferent pay structures for performing different work.\\u201d It characterizes as \\u201cmisleading and inaccurate\\u201d the claims that the women\\u2019s team generates more revenue than the men\\u2019s, while also framing the women\\u2019s and men\\u2019s teams as so different from each other that they can\\u2019t legitimately be compared at all. This is true in at least one sense: The women are way, way better. The men\\u2019s national team lost in the round of 16 at the 2014 World Cup and didn\\u2019t even qualify for the 2018 World Cup. American men haven\\u2019t won an Olympic medal in more than a century. Partly as a consequence of their superior results, from 2015 to 2018, the women\\u2019s team played 19 more matches than the men. In other words, the women aren\\u2019t working as hard as their male counterparts for less money; they\\u2019re working <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">harder</em> for less money. For the record, the men\\u2019s team\\u2019s players association released a statement of full-throated support for their women\\u2019s team compatriots and the mutual goal of equal pay.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In her Barnard speech, Wambach said she regretted being so caught up in gratitude for what she and her peers did receive that she \\u201cmissed opportunities to demand equality for all of us.\\u201d Her former teammates do not intend to make that same mistake. They are better paid than any women\\u2019s sports team in history, and at least as well known, but it\\u2019s not enough. Not only because by the players\\u2019 calculations they are making as little as 38 cents to their male counterparts\\u2019 dollar, but because these players feel a responsibility to fight, in public, on the biggest stage possible, while they can. \\u201cIt\\u2019s wonderful to be a professional athlete and feel fulfilled, but at the same time, what sort of legacy do you want to leave?\\u201d Morgan wonders. \\u201cI had this dream of being a professional soccer player, and I never knew it entailed being a role model, being an inspiration, standing up for things I believe in, standing up for gender equality. But now I don\\u2019t know a world where I just play soccer. It goes hand in hand.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">On a glittering April</strong> evening in Los Angeles, 20,941 fans crowded into the Banc of California Stadium, home to Major League Soccer\\u2019s Los Angeles F.C., to watch the American women trounce the 20th-ranked Belgians, 6-0, in a match of no real consequence. (This was one of several exhibition matches, known as \\u201cfriendlies,\\u201d the women\\u2019s team played before leaving for France.) Three teenage girls gathered on the south end of the stadium near the Belgian goal. Two wanted to head up to the mezzanine to see if they could get a glimpse of the Hollywood celebrities in the house \\u2014 Natalie Portman, Jessica Chastain, Jennifer Garner, Eva Longoria and Uzo Aduba were all in the V.I.P. box, hanging out with Megan Rapinoe, who was not playing because of a mild injury. But one of the teenagers, a tall brunette in jean shorts and a cropped T-shirt, wasn\\u2019t ready to go actress hunting yet. She stood staring at the action on the pitch, mesmerized. \\u201cLet me just see this last play,\\u201d she pleaded \\u2014 and right then, Carli Lloyd cut back behind her defender and threaded a perfect pass to Alex Morgan, who chipped it into the back of the net.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The official Time\\u2019s Up Instagram account later posted a photo of the actresses, all Time\\u2019s Up supporters, in their U.S.W.N.T. jerseys, with the caption \\u201cIt\\u2019s time for U.S. Soccer Federation to pay their women players what they deserve.\\u201d That Time\\u2019s Up is choosing to formally align itself, and its quest for equal pay in Hollywood, with the women\\u2019s national team is particularly gratifying for the players. They consider their fight to be in keeping with the larger social-justice stories of this era, from the rise of explicitly feminist movements like Time\\u2019s Up and #MeToo to Black Lives Matter and L.G.B.T. advocacy. \\u201cIt\\u2019s one and the same,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cI get asked this question a lot, like, \\u2018Where does this come from?\\u2019 or \\u2018Why do you stand up for these things?\\u2019 To me, it\\u2019s literally all the same, insofar as I want people to respect who I am, what I am \\u2014 being gay, being a woman, being a professional athlete, whatever. That is the exact same thing as what Colin did.\\u201d Rapinoe began kneeling during the national anthem in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick in September 2016; in March 2017, U.S. Soccer instituted a policy requiring players to \\u201cstand respectfully.\\u201d (Rapinoe now stands but does not place her hand over her heart.) \\u201cWho do you want to be?\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cWhat kind of person do you want to be for yourself, but also in the larger context of the country and in the world?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Serena Williams, asked by reporters to comment on the women\\u2019s soccer team\\u2019s lawsuit after a second-round victory at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., called the pay discrepancy \\u201cludicrous,\\u201d adding, \\u201cI think at some point, in every sport, you have to have those pioneers, and maybe it\\u2019s the time for soccer.\\u201d Indeed, American women\\u2019s soccer has its original class of pioneers: the so-called 99ers, members of the 1999 World Cup-winning team. At the Los Angeles friendly, Jennifer Garner wore one of their names \\u2014 Mia Hamm \\u2014 on her jersey, Aduba wore the legendary goalkeeper Briana Scurry\\u2019s number and Jessica Chastain wore the jersey of a player with whom she happens to share a surname: Brandi Chastain. It was Brandi Chastain who became a kind of aesthetic allegory for the spirit of the national team when, after sinking the winning penalty against China in the 1999 final, she whipped off her jersey in celebration. The image of Chastain in her sports bra, six-pack on display, triumph on her face, is one of the most famous in the history of sports, both because it captured a huge moment in soccer and because it launched a backlash against Chastain, who was accused of being disrespectful by critics who appeared to believe it was cool for male players to celebrate in this way but uncouth for women to do the same.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/sports/womens-world-cup-jamaica.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Read about the Women\\u2019s World Cup\\u2019s other inequality: rich vs. poor.]</em></a></p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many of the 99ers were in attendance at the friendly to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their World Cup victory. It was that win that established the Americans as women\\u2019s soccer\\u2019s first true global stars, the first group of players with the clout to move the needle on issues big (better pay) and small (getting uniforms in women\\u2019s sizes). Before that World Cup, which was held for the first time in the United States, the team was accustomed to playing to crowds of 5,000, but the 1999 World Cup final at the Rose Bowl drew 90,185 people, still the record for a women\\u2019s sporting event. After they won, the players toured the country like rock stars, visiting the White House, Disneyland and \\u201cThe Late Show,\\u201d where David Letterman referred to them as \\u201cbabe city.\\u201d When the dust settled, however, America\\u2019s newest sweethearts discovered that they were out of work. There was still no viable professional league in the United States.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The 99ers were determined to use the leverage gained by their victory to start a fully professional league, the W.U.S.A. But by the time the national team (including a young Abby Wambach) was defending its title four years later, the league had already folded. And so it went for the next decade. The women\\u2019s national team continued to be among the most elite in the world, but it returned home after major victories (Olympic gold in 2004, 2008, 2012) to a succession of professional leagues that never stabilized, all the while clawing out incremental financial advances in a series of collective-bargaining agreements with U.S. Soccer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The National Women\\u2019s Soccer League, now in its seventh season, is the longest-running professional women\\u2019s soccer league ever in the United States, but its players still do not make a living wage: The minimum salary was just bumped up to $16,538. Major League Soccer pays male players a minimum salary in the $50,000-a-year range.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The women\\u2019s national team\\u2019s lawsuit will play out in a Los Angeles courtroom on a date yet to be set by the Federal District Court, where U.S. Soccer will need to show that the pay disparities between their two teams exist for some reason, any reason, other than sex. According to the women\\u2019s lawsuit, U.S. Soccer has said it can\\u2019t grant economic parity because \\u201cmarket realities are such that the women do not deserve to be paid equally to the men.\\u201d Then there\\u2019s the \\u201cBut you agreed to be paid less\\u201d argument, which appears to be central to U.S. Soccer\\u2019s strategy: In April 2017, the women\\u2019s national team and U.S. Soccer signed a new collective-bargaining agreement in which the women gained ground but did not receive the equal pay they were hoping for. \\u201cIt was the best deal we could get at the time,\\u201d Rapinoe says.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The previous agreement had been in place since 2013. As the 2016 Olympics loomed, the female players were reportedly considering striking \\u2014 hoping to leverage their position as defending gold medalists to increase their shot at earning equal compensation in their next collective-bargaining agreement \\u2014 when U.S. Soccer sued to prevent them from doing so and won.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shortly before that ruling came down, five members of the team \\u2014 Megan Rapinoe, Carli Lloyd, Becky Sauerbrunn, Alex Morgan and Hope Solo, the goalkeeper at the time \\u2014 filed a federal discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is required before you can sue. This February, when the team was between training camps, the five original players named in the 2016 complaint finally received a response in the form of \\u201cright to sue\\u201d letters, meaning that no determination had been reached one way or another and that they had 90 days to file suit in federal court. So they did.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The 2019 Women\\u2019s World Cup is expected to be the most watched in history. In the United States, these matches will most likely be among the highest-rated soccer games ever played. (The 2015 final in Canada, between the United States and Japan, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/sports/soccer/womens-world-cup-final-was-most-watched-soccer-game-in-united-states-history.html?searchResultPosition=6&amp;module=inline" title="">averaged 23 million English-language viewers</a> in the States, six million more than the 2014 Men\\u2019s World Cup final.) Yes, the Americans are favored, but they have never won Women\\u2019s World Cup titles back to back, and the United States has lately shown some vulnerability. The last major tournament it won was the 2015 World Cup. In 2017, it failed to perform as well as expected in two invitational events hosted on home soil, coming in last in the SheBelieves Cup and finishing second to Australia in the Tournament of Nations. At that point, several senior players, in what Sports Illustrated called a \\u201cplayer revolt,\\u201d initiated conversations with U.S. Soccer about replacing Coach Jill Ellis.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This unrest came in the wake of the most psychologically gutting performance in team history, at the 2016 Olympics in Brazil. For the first time ever, the team failed to make the Olympic gold medal match; they lost on penalty kicks to Sweden in the quarterfinals. To say the humiliation of this defeat still stings is to put it mildly. \\u201cA lot of the players on this team that have never been to a World Cup did go to the Olympics and were a part of the team that didn\\u2019t perform as well as we should have and had the worst exit that we\\u2019ve ever had in the Olympics, and we never want to replicate that ever in this program, but especially this World Cup,\\u201d Alex Morgan told me in an unusually breathless burst. \\u201cThat\\u2019s definitely in the back of my mind.\\u201d At the end of 2017, U.S. Soccer made it clear that Ellis was staying, and by 2018 things had stabilized a bit; the team went undefeated last year. But in their first match of 2019, they lost 3-1 to France, a rising power that will no doubt be emboldened this summer, playing on its home turf.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In filing suit when they did, the players set themselves up for a very tense few months \\u2014 in part because they believe that their performance on the pitch holds the key to their progress off it. \\u201cAlways and forever, how well the team does on the biggest stage is probably the most important thing,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I stress to these kids,\\u201d she continues, referring to the younger players like Pugh and Horan, who walked into the national team\\u2019s world believing that their job was merely to play the best soccer of their lives and are now learning that\\u2019s only part of it. \\u201cEverything is more and better,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cI want them to understand that it\\u2019s better because we earned it; but it\\u2019s also better because we won. The most important thing is continuing to win.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">In the lobby</strong> of a boutique hotel in downtown Santa Barbara, where the national team stayed during its World Cup training camp in March, well-heeled tourists poured cucumber water from glass vats and discussed where to lunch. The whole place smelled like expensive candles. \\u201cNo more Marriott Residence Inn for us,\\u201d Rapinoe said with a grin after settling into an overstuffed love seat next to a stunning bouquet of flowers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About an hour earlier, the 28 athletes who were in contention for the World Cup team (23 would make the cut) finished practice. As some traipsed through the lobby, sweaty and joking with one another, a few sang the chorus to Lil Nas X\\u2019s \\u201cOld Town Road\\u201d (\\u201cCan\\u2019t nobody tell me nothin\\u2019/You can\\u2019t tell me nothin\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d), which had been a fixture in camp. Soon they would shower and have group lunch. The day before, the players also had morning training followed by lunch, then a meeting with the team\\u2019s sports psychologist before group dinner. After training, there are ice baths and other recovery work. This is how the players\\u2019 lives are programmed: Eat, train, recover, eat, sleep, repeat. \\u201cSoccer is like \\u2018Groundhog Day,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s great, it\\u2019s fine, but it\\u2019s not that exciting all the time.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWe know the sacrifices we make; it\\u2019s no different than what men make,\\u201d Carli Lloyd says. \\u201cWe\\u2019re away from our families. We\\u2019re away from our friends. We\\u2019re spending every waking hour dedicating ourselves to this.\\u201d If an international squad is a collection of roles filled by a rotating cast of actual human beings, Lloyd is currently in the \\u201cseasoned veteran in the twilight of her career\\u201d spot, the one Wambach was in during the last World Cup. A two-time FIFA player of the year, Lloyd scored a hat trick in the first 16 minutes of the 2015 final against Japan, topping off an already remarkable run of play. Lloyd is 36 now. She feels as sharp as ever, she says, and has been playing largely as a second-half substitute in these recent friendlies, scoring thrilling clutch goals. But she is not likely to get a ton of playing time in France, and even if she does, this is almost certainly her last World Cup.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When I joked about how it would be amusing to try to train with her, she snickered and told me about one reporter who tried that and tore her A.C.L. \\u2014 \\u201cYou could hear the pop\\u201d \\u2014 and another who broke her wrist trying to block a Lloyd shot. But Lloyd turned wistful when she shared that she and her husband are planning to start a family in the next few years, but in looking at their bank account she realized: \\u201cI can\\u2019t just say, \\u2018O.K., this is my last game, and I\\u2019ve made tens of millions of dollars and it\\u2019s stashed away and we\\u2019re good.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d For the moment, Lloyd has no interest in retiring. She remains committed to the lawsuit \\u2014 though she acknowledges she \\u201cmay be done playing by the time this gets resolved\\u201d \\u2014 and to winning in France. She also deeply enjoys the rigorous two-a-day training sessions she does when home in New Jersey. This is all part of what Lloyd calls her eternal addiction to \\u201cchasing something I need to improve on.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They all talk like this, about a state of permanent dissatisfaction and a pleasure taken in pursuing the very perfection they know is unattainable. The one thing every of them has is this superhuman drive. \\u201cPlayers come in all the time, great players, sometimes more talented players,\\u201d says the forward Christen Press, the squad\\u2019s resident \\u201cWhat does it all mean?\\u201d existential philosopher, who first played on the team in 2012. \\u201cThe players that survive here are the most competitive ones. No one on this team has been here for more than two years and not felt like they had their face planted on the ground. Many just don\\u2019t get up. The people that last here get up.\\u201d She continues: \\u201cIt\\u2019s such a small, elite group that you\\u2019re filtered out if you don\\u2019t have that.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If Lloyd represents one role in the life cycle of a national team player, Lindsey Horan represents its opposite: the young-gun rising star and one of the picks to emerge from this World Cup a newly minted superstar. Her path is itself a testament to the progress that has been made in opportunities for American women who love to play soccer. When Lloyd made her debut on the team in 2005, there was <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">still</em> no viable professional league in the United States. Lloyd played all four years at Rutgers, then came to the national team \\u201cright when they were negotiating stable salaries and contracts,\\u201d she remembers. Horan, on the other hand, went straight to the pros from high school. This is a controversial move. Press calls it \\u201ccrazy\\u201d for most players, laughing and shaking her head. \\u201cThe league is not stable enough,\\u201d she explains. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re playing in the N.B.A., you can make two years of your salary and pay for your college anytime you want to go back. But that\\u2019s not the case with the N.W.S.L.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Advisable or not, by 2012, when Horan got on the plane to France to begin her time at Paris Saint-Germain, professional women\\u2019s leagues were prominent enough, in the States and in Europe, that such a move was possible. It was her dream, so she went for it. Horan is not much for keeping her cards close to her chest. Getting called up, training, playing well in international tournaments, then focusing on showing her best game in camp these last months has been enough of a challenge, she says, without the added pressure to become a civil rights activist overnight. \\u201cIt has been very hard,\\u201d Horan says. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always just been like: Oh, I love soccer. I love being here. I\\u2019m so happy to be a part of this team.\\u201d But lately, that has shifted. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always wanted to just stay out of that and focus on the game, but now I think that is almost selfish, because we do have a voice, and so many people watch us, and we\\u2019re their inspirations, and we\\u2019re their idols, and us speaking up is huge.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The \\u201cfour or five girls that are very vocal\\u201d who Horan says helped her reach this conclusion \\u2014 the team leaders when it comes to advocacy \\u2014 have a knack for instilling a sense of social responsibility in others. \\u201cWe try, first of all, education,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cWe break down the inequities. We tell them: This is why we are choosing to take this stance, for these reasons. We try to show specifically how it affects each individual player, but then also the team as a whole.\\u201d Could someone have declined to join the lawsuit if she wanted to? \\u201cYeah,\\u201d says Rapinoe, slowly. \\u201cIt\\u2019s always possible, and we had some players that took longer.\\u201d But, she says, \\u201cIf you want the door open, you have to open it.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">On a welcome</strong> bright April day after a very wet stretch in Denver, 10-year-old Lilli and her 9-year-old friend, Reese, sat in their soccer kits, legs dangling off white folding chairs, in front of City Hall. This was a school day, but Reese\\u2019s mother brought them to watch two of their heroes, Lindsey Horan and Mallory Pugh, receive an honorary street sign and a \\u201cchallenge coin,\\u201d the equivalent of a key to the city. Pugh and Horan are both Denver-area natives, and both came up through the hypercompetitive ranks of Colorado youth soccer. They are models for what Lilli and Reese plan to become when they grow up: pro soccer players. \\u201cIt\\u2019s educational!\\u201d Lilli insisted of this field trip for two. Then she showed off the ball, shoes, shin guards and backpack she had brought to have signed. By which player? \\u201cBoth of them!\\u201d Lilli plays offense, and this kind of game-day aggressiveness will come in handy for her on the field, for sure, but it may be even more important off the field if she\\u2019s serious about a career in professional soccer.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Watching Horan and Pugh stand only somewhat awkwardly next to the mayor, with their parents snapping pictures and a local news crew on hand to document the quaint pageantry, felt like watching the opening scene in a biopic. Each is already a groundbreaker: Pugh is the youngest American player, at 17, ever to play in an Olympic-qualifying match, and Horan is the first American woman to go straight from high school to the pros. They now play for top teams in the N.W.S.L. \\u2014 Pugh for the Washington Spirit, Horan for the Portland Thorns \\u2014 and they have high-profile endorsement deals (Pugh with Nike, Horan with Adidas). Pugh and Horan didn\\u2019t know this yet, but they would each make the World Cup squad \\u2014 another milestone reached. But the question remains: Will one or both of these players break the record so many of her predecessors could not and become the first in women\\u2019s soccer history to retire without having to worry about her next paycheck? And if not Pugh or Horan, how about by the time we get to Lilli or Reese?</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The 28 women suing U.S. Soccer have, in some cases, very little in common other than their sport. Avowed Christians and atheists, gay and straight, politically active and not, they have nonetheless rallied behind this collective cause. \\u201cYou really do need everyone,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a crazy intimate environment. We\\u2019re not all really, really close, but we\\u2019re extremely intimate.\\u201d At the hotel in Santa Barbara, she brought up the concept of \\u201cthe double earn,\\u201d a reference to the unpaid labor taken on by women, especially at home, that goes largely unacknowledged; Rapinoe was drawing a parallel between that work and the work that she and her teammates are having to do to secure equal rights that should already be theirs. The soccer players, differences aside, have something powerful in common besides competitive drive: They are, every one of them, from 20-year-old defender Tierna Davidson to 36-year-old Carli Lloyd, pulling a double shift. \\u201cWe really don\\u2019t want to be doing all of this all of the time,\\u201d Rapinoe says. \\u201cWe\\u2019d much prefer to not be engaging in litigations. We\\u2019d much prefer not to have to be the nag in the room. We\\u2019d prefer to be thought partners and business partners.\\u201d Rapinoe sat up a little straighter in her seat. \\u201cBut obviously that\\u2019s not the case.\\u201d</p>]]'

S'[[<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">CINCINNATI \\u2014 Most of us can probably agree that eating food is more enjoyable than watching someone else eat food. For one, it\\u2019s a basic human need. It also tastes good a lot of the time. Not to mention, people can be pretty gross when they eat, especially when they do so in over-the-top, finger-licking fashion.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, hundreds of thousands of people tune in each week to watch Bethany Gaskin binge-eat shellfish on YouTube.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mrs.<!-- --> Gaskin, 44, has capitalized on the popularity of a food-video genre known as mukbang, which involves scarfing down, on camera, more grub than should rightly be consumed in a single sitting. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On her two YouTube channels, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG_Nlvx1EoxkeZkuLjelWdA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Bloveslife</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqzQA4tjCh-uAOAHz8_qGpQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">BlovesASMR Eating Her Way</a>, Mrs. Gaskin chats up her audience while eating king crab legs, mussels, lobster tails, hard-boiled eggs and roasted red potatoes. The videos, produced in her Cincinnati home, have made her a millionaire, she said. But getting into the business wasn\\u2019t about money; mukbang was more of a calling than a vocation.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cI think of mukbanging as a ministry,\\u201d Mrs. Gaskin said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t consult with my husband before I quit my job. I knew this was it, and I quit by faith.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mukbang seems to have begun as an internet trend more than a decade ago in South Korea.<!-- --> The name is a mash-up of the Korean words for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-31130947" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">let\\u2019s eat (\\u201cmuk-ja\\u201d) and broadcasting (\\u201cbang-song\\u201d)</a>. Korean live-streamers often schedule their mukbang videos to align with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://qz.com/592710/why-some-koreans-make-10000-a-month-to-eat-on-camera/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">dinnertime hours</a>, so their viewers eating alone at home feel like they\\u2019re sharing a meal with a friend.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Viewers cite other benefits too. Watching the videos can serve as an appetite-curbing exercise. And for a certain subset, the sounds of a person eating foster an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/magazine/how-asmr-videos-became-a-sensation-youtube.html?module=inline" title="">autonomous sensory meridian response, or A.S.M.R.</a>; viewers derive pleasure from the sounds created by extra-loud crunching, slurping and lip smacking. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Craig Richard, 49, a professor of physiology at Shenandoah University and the creator of a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://asmruniversity.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">website dedicated to the study of A.S.M.R.</a>, said that while the phenomenon is not medically diagnosed, people who enjoy A.S.M.R. experience a sensation of \\u201csparkling brain tingles\\u201d while viewing \\u201ctrigger\\u201d videos.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On a recent Tuesday, Mrs. Gaskin sat down in her home studio for a recording session <!-- -->with her son Dalvin<!-- -->, who is 25 and something of a prot\\xe9g\\xe9, and his friend Nicole.<!-- --> On the walls were plaques commemorating the day she reached the one-million-subscriber mark on YouTube, as well as <!-- -->a framed letter from Susan Wojcicki, the C.E.O. of YouTube.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mrs. Gaskin began the show with a friendly singsong greeting: \\u201cWhat\\u2019s up my Bloveleez?,\\u201d a nickname she uses to refer to her viewers. Then she announced the night\\u2019s meal, elongating the vowels in \\u201cseafood boil\\u201d as a soccer commentator would when announcing a goal. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before diving into her food, she said a brief prayer: \\u201cHeavenly Father, in the name of Jesus, I thank you for this food I\\u2019m about to receive. In Jesus\\u2019s name, I pray. Amen.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The food was strategically positioned on a <!-- -->serving tray<!-- -->, with the most colorful items on top and accented by bright yellow lemons and corn on the cob. On the table in front of the tray were three glass bowls of Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s homemade Smackalicious sauce. She wants to manufacture the spices used in the sauce so viewers can make their own.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before taking the first bite of food, Mrs. Gaskin, Dalvin and Nicole<!-- --> <!-- -->briefly paused in front of the camera. They posed with a crab leg, and, while smiling, they sang the word \\u201cthumbnail.\\u201d After the photo, the real action began. Once Mrs. Gaskin dipped her food into her Smackalicious sauce, she took her first bite and closed her eyes as she chewed.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While nodding, she said, \\u201cYup, umm hmm y\\u2019all, this is good.\\u201d<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>She used slurping noises to indicate that something was juicy, followed by more head nods and \\u201cyup\\u201d utterances, as well as some vaguely orgasmic sounds. Dr. Richard said that these \\u201cmouth sounds,\\u201d in combination with Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s \\u201ckind and positive disposition\\u201d and the abundance of the food, are textbook A.S.M.R. triggers.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s house, these kinds of table manners aren\\u2019t punished but celebrated. She and her Bloveleez slurp and chew noisily and, as she put it, \\u201cunapologetically.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Perhaps the noisy and bad-mannered eating is off-putting for most, but the genre has a lot of devotees, if Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s success is any indication. Her primary YouTube channel, Bloveslife, has 1.8<!-- --> million subscribers<!-- -->, and on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/bloveslife2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Instagram</a> she has a following of nearly 900,000, one of whom is Cardi B. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Through advertising on her videos, Mrs. Gaskin said she has made more than $1 million, <!-- -->providing screenshots of a report from YouTube.<!-- --> </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before becoming a YouTube sensation, Mrs. Gaskin, who has an associate\\u2019s degree in early childhood development, owned a day care facility. After five years, she sold the business and used the money to pay off loans and leases. She then got a job making circuit boards for the military for a year. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2017, she started making Food Network-style cooking videos in her home kitchen and posting them on YouTube. \\u201cI\\u2019m a foodie,\\u201d Mrs. Gaskin said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always liked to cook.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThen I did a mukbang, and people just went crazy,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was like, \\u2018People want to see me eat, this is weird,\\u2019 and since they were easier to record, I just started doing mukbangs and all of a sudden, it just took off from there.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s first mukbang video featured a seafood boil and a largely improvised monologue. Viewers left comments like: \\u201cSmacking, finger licking, straight getting down!! Just being yourself\\u2026very cool stuff!\\u201d and \\u201cI\\u2019m allergic so I can\\u2019t eat it, but you make me wanna take the risk of eating a fried shrimp, just in front of the Emergency Room.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cHer first 10 seafood boils were doing amazing, and I think it was the fifth one that was recognized by the \\u2018Stranger Things\\u2019 cast,\\u201d her son Darius, 18, said. His mother\\u2019s \\u201covernight\\u201d success is something he is still getting used to, more than two years into her YouTube career.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her husband, Nate, said that, in the beginning, he didn\\u2019t see how mukbang could help support the family.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWhen she first started this, I thought it was just going to be a hobby that she wanted to do,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut when it took off, it really changed the dynamic financially for our family, because in a very short period of time, she was making more money than I was.\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s success encouraged her husband to retire early from his 20-year managerial position at General Electric. Since then, Mr. Gaskin has been his wife\\u2019s full-time manager.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her audience has now surpassed that of the YouTubers who inspired her to pursue mukbang. She said that in particular videos by Jasper Daze, who died in 2016 after complications with diabetes, helped her pick shellfish as her cuisine of choice. She dedicated her first mukbang to him.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though the chatter around mukbang videos tends to focus on their benefits, there are also some who see reason for concern. Theresa Kinsella, 42, a dietitian, said in a phone interview that these videos \\u201cglorify overeating,\\u201d promote disordered eating and ignore the possible risks associated with overconsumption.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cThe short-term health risks are physical discomfort, gastrointestinal distress, lethargy and fatigue,\\u201d Ms. Kinsella said. As for the long-term effects, she cited weight gain, heart disease and diabetes.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before the recording, Mrs. Gaskin, a surprisingly petite 4-foot-11, said that mukbang hasn\\u2019t affected her health. She eats only when she films, she said, which is on average twice a day.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of her fans send gifts. <!-- -->Others describe her as their \\u201cmedication,\\u201d<!-- --> Mrs. Gaskin said, adding that some cancer patients have thanked her for helping them regain their appetites.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Reese Anthony, 34, from St. Louis, Mo., is a fan of Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s fried chicken and shrimp dipping videos, and says that A.S.M.R. videos have helped him with his anxiety and depression. </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cWhen I first started watching these videos, and some of my friends knew I was watching these videos, they thought it was weird,\\u201d he <!-- -->said<!-- --> in a phone interview. \\u201cBut they don\\u2019t get it because they aren\\u2019t tapping into their senses.\\u201d </p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Anthony also alluded to the A.S.M.R. quality of Mrs. Gaskin\\u2019s screen presence. \\u201cThe videos can put me to sleep and relax me,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt makes my hair on my arms stand up or gives me goose bumps because it\\u2019s so relaxing.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mrs. Gaskin credits her ability to appear authentic as a reason for her success. The other is her faith. \\u201cAs long as my family and God are behind me, I\\u2019m good,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd I wake up happy every day.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It wasn\\u2019t always easy. At one point during her childhood, Mrs. Gaskin said, she was homeless. \\u201cI know the struggle,\\u201d she said. \\u201cMy mom would sacrifice eating to make sure me and my brother ate.\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That\\u2019s when Dalvin and Nicole walked through the door. Mrs. Gaskin asked, \\u201cDid y\\u2019all eat?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dalvin said they had not.</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">\\u201cDo y\\u2019all want to eat with me?\\u201d</p>, <p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And the workday began.</p>]]'
