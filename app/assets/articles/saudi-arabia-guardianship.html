<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BEIRUT, Lebanon — On the surface, the new regulations Saudi Arabia announced early Friday did not seem like much. In dense, bureaucratic language, they granted all Saudis over the age of 21 the right to handle family matters and their own affairs, while officials said that all adults could obtain passports and travel on their own.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But for gender relations in the kingdom, the new regulations were an earthquake, because for the first time <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-guardianship-women.html?module=inline" title="">they granted women the<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>kind of rights</a> that had previously been under the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/world/middleeast/saudi-women-guardianship.html?module=inline" title="">control of male relatives</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is a great breakthrough,” Hoda al-Helaissi, a member of the kingdom’s advisory Shura Council, said on Friday. “It was bound to happen, but these changes are always done at a time when the people are more apt to accept the changes, otherwise they will fail.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new regulations that arrived under Saudi Arabia’s day-to-day ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, were the most significant weakening yet of Saudi Arabia’s “guardianship” system, a longstanding tangle of laws, regulations and social customs that rights campaigners have long criticized as oppressing Saudi women.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a practical matter, the changes will most likely take time to trickle down to individual households and to women. As a symbolic matter, however, they are pivotal.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Muna AbuSulayman, a well-known Saudi media personality, posted on Twitter overnight that she was so elated that she could not sleep. “This change means women are in a way in full control of their legal destiny,” she wrote.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other Saudi women’s Twitter feeds crackled with jubilant posts. Memes of women praising the crown prince and ululating in celebration danced around the internet.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday evening, Princess Reema bint Bandar al-Saud, the kingdom’s ambassador to the United States and Saudi Arabia’s first female ambassador, wrote on Twitter that “our leadership has proved its unequivocal commitment to gender equality.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She added: “These new regulations are history in the making. They call for the equal engagement of women and men in our society.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The guardianship changes were announced as part of a broader drive by Prince Mohammed to overhaul the kingdom’s economy and to open up society. Since his father, King Salman, ascended to the throne in 2015, the prince, 33, has begun initiatives aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil, confronting Iran and loosening the kingdom’s notoriously strict social customs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent years, he has pushed for more women to enter the work force, removed the power to arrest from the kingdom’s religious police and granted women the right to drive, billing the moves as essential for the insular Islamic kingdom to progress and to build its economy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But accompanying that wider social opening have been riskier moves that raised questions about whether Prince Mohammed’s brash leadership style would destabilize the kingdom, and the Middle East as a whole. His forces are bogged down and accused of war crimes in Yemen. The murder of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year drew global condemnation. And waves of arrests have scooped up clerics, intellectuals, royals, businessmen and even some activists who had campaigned for an end to the driving ban and the guardianship system.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those arrests, and the wider intolerance of dissent or criticism under Prince Mohammed, made it hard to fully gauge public reaction to the changes, but many Saudi women cheered them as liberating.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. al-Helaissi, the Shura Council member, said she did not expect the changes to have a great immediate effect on most families, but she said the biggest beneficiaries would be divorced or widowed women who could now run their family affairs more easily.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though the regulations allowing women to register family matters may appear routine, they will make an enormous difference for some women, such as those who are separated from their husbands and those who need to navigate the bureaucracy on behalf of their children, said Adam Coogle, a Saudi expert at Human Rights Watch.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the past, he said, separated women have reported being punished or extorted by husbands who would not help obtain birth certificates or other bureaucratic records for children.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The regulations were approved by the Saudi cabinet and appeared to include granting all Saudis, regardless of gender, the right to obtain passports, travel and register births, marriages and divorces. They also barred discrimination in employment on the basis of gender, age or disability.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A statement released by the Saudi Embassy in Washington said that the new regulations regarding travel documents would go into effect by the end of August. It was unclear whether that applied to the other new regulations, as well.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The ban on employment discrimination will also prevent private employers from telling women that they would need guardians’ permission to be hired — something businesses had done with impunity, even though the law does not require women to obtain consent to work.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was not clear why the new regulations were announced now, but the kingdom most likely hoped that some good news would draw attention from the foreign criticism of its human rights record, which amplified after the murder of Mr. Khashoggi last year. It has also faced frequent criticism of its prosecution of the war in Yemen, leading to growing calls by American lawmakers to cut support for the Saudi war effort.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A number of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-flee.html?module=inline" title="">young Saudi women have fled abroad</a> in recent years, seeking refuge from abusive family members and a legal system they do not trust to protect them — and drawing unwanted attention to the guardianship system.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new regulations could take time to work their way into the kingdom’s often sclerotic bureaucracy. Inside homes, conservative Saudi men will retain power over their female relatives, regardless of what the laws say.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Coogle said that absent some kind of government intervention to enforce the regulations, employers and officials may continue to demand guardians’ involvement.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s the trick,” he said. “We have to see what kind of infrastructure they put in place to implement these changes.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But about two-thirds of the kingdom’s 22 million citizens are under age 30, and many lack their elders’ attachment to the kingdom’s traditional social strictures. They will be more used to seeing women working as supermarket cashiers and driving themselves to and from work.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. AbuSulayman said on Twitter that while her father had never put obstacles in her path, she had gone so far as to consider moving abroad to avoid being subject to the guardianship of her brothers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But now, she said, her eldest daughter — who, under the current system, would have had to obtain her father’s permission to renew her passport this year — would grow up without restrictions on her right to travel.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“She will never know about this episode in our nation’s life,” Ms. AbuSulayman wrote. “A generation growing up completely free and equal to their brothers.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Ms. AbuSulayman also noted that for many women she knew, the news passed without comment. Saudi women’s experiences of guardianship can vary drastically according to their class and education level, not to mention their male guardians’ attitudes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If “some women’s dreams were aborted” by the travel barriers, she wrote, they were “a minor nuisance for most.” Still, she said, they were “a symbolic indignity for a wider concept of adulthood, accountability and meaning of personhood.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Granting women legal rights equal to those of men is a major change in Saudi society, whose social codes have long been driven by an ultraconservative interpretation of Islam and by traditional Arabian practices that kept women not only out of public life, but also out of sight, in many cases.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Girls’ education was introduced only in the 1960s, and even then it caused trouble in conservative cities. And for decades, top state clerics have promoted strict segregation between women and men and have preached that it would be better if women stayed home.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most of those clerics have now been silenced and some of their old teachings expunged from government websites. While many most likely oppose Prince Mohammed’s social reforms, they have kept quiet, either out of deference to the monarchy or because they fear arrest for speaking out.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Critics of the guardianship laws hailed the changes as genuinely significant. But they called on the kingdom to push further by allowing women to marry, live on their own and exit state facilities like prison and domestic violence shelters without consent from their guardians.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And they noted a distinct irony in the announcement. Even as the kingdom loosens the cuffs of guardianship, about a dozen female Saudi activists who spoke out about reforming the system remain imprisoned on charges related to their activism on women’s issues.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some have been detained for more than a year, undergoing court proceedings wrapped in secrecy, and rights groups have said that they have reported being tortured and sexually harassed while in prison.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“As long as the women activists are still being tried and charged for calling for these same reforms, well, we’re still within the same social contract,” said Lynn Maalouf, the director of Middle East research for Amnesty International.</p>
