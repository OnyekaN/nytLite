<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Komodo dragons are the largest lizards on the planet, with some adults measured at more than 350 pounds and longer than 10 feet. They detect their prey, including deer and water buffalo, from miles away with an exquisite sense of smell, and at close range, they race at terrifying speeds. Even a single bite can be enough to seal the prey’s fate, because a dragon’s saliva contains potent anticoagulants: Once the bleeding starts, it doesn’t stop.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But when Komodo dragons bite each other, which they do with some frequency, they do not bleed out the way their prey do. That suggests that at some point, they evolved a resistance to their own anticoagulants.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s one example of the odd batch of traits that have fascinated scientists, including Katherine Pollard, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at the University of California, San Francisco, as well as a researcher at the Gladstone Institutes. She wondered what the Komodo dragons’ genome would reveal about their biology and evolution. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0945-8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a paper published last week</a> in Nature Ecology and Evolution, she and her colleagues present the lizards’ genome, revealing evidence of a large number of mutations in important Komodo genes. Their analysis offers insights into the dragons’ blood, senses and other unique aspects of their anatomy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The group cobbled together a draft genome from two dragons living at Zoo Atlanta some years ago, and used tissue from a dragon in the Prague National Zoo to flesh it out. But more recently, Abigail Lind, a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Pollard’s lab, focused on the process of interpreting the genome. Using algorithms that helped parse which parts of the sequence coded for proteins, Dr. Lind identified more than 18,000 genes. With the help of other lizard genomes, the researchers made predictions about the genes’ roles.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We wanted to particularly look at different unique traits,” Dr. Pollard said. “The most obvious one is they are gigantic. But there are some other really cool things about them.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To look for Komodo genes that had undergone concerted evolution, the researchers pinpointed about 200 with a particularly large number of mutations compared to related species. This pattern suggested that natural selection had favored alterations to those genes, honing them into a form that is specific to the dragons.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many such changes were related to mitochondria, the cellular structures responsible for generating energy. That implied that the dragons may have modified mitochondria to support their sudden bursts of speed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Others represented a family of sensory receptors that have blossomed in number in the dragons, perhaps linked to their uncanny sniffing abilities.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still others encoded numerous proteins involved in blood clotting, suggesting that the dragons may have special genes that allow them to survive their own saliva.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Additional lab experiments would be required to test how the dragons’ proteins actually work and how their modifications may enable their special abilities. For instance, Dr. Pollard is interested in mixing dragon saliva and blood together in a dish to see what happens. That may take a while, however.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They don’t really want to give up bodily fluids,” she said of the dragons, unless they are anesthetized.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Surprisingly, the researchers found no particular insights into the lizards’ giant size. There were no obvious changes to genes involved in development and growth, as you might expect if there had been positive selection encouraging their growth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One alternate hypothesis is that enormous size may be an ancestral trait among lizards, and tiny lizards are a more recent development. Perhaps the Komodos are the normal ones, Dr. Pollard speculated, and everyone else, through the eons, has changed.</p>
