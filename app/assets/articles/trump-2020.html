<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What is President Trump going to do to win the voters who rejected him in 2016?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s a serious question. Roughly 137 million people voted in the last presidential election. Most of them — about 74 million people, or 54 percent of all ballots cast — did not vote for Trump. His self-proclaimed “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/12/donald-trump/donald-trumps-electoral-college-victory-was-not-ma/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">massive landslide</a>” rests on a thin margin of victory in just three states.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once in office, Trump abandoned the heterodox Republicanism of his campaign for hard-right policies opposed by most Americans. He fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act. When that failed, he pushed for an unpopular upper-income tax cut. He reveled in cruelty toward immigrants and took the side of racist demonstrators in Charlottesville, Va. He governs for his base alone, with no sense or understanding of the collective good.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I have a base that’s a phenomenal — it’s just a phenomenal base,” Trump said in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://time.com/5611476/donald-trump-transcript-time-interview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a recent interview</a> with Time magazine. “It’s a very loyal base and I’m loyal to them also.” When asked if he should reach beyond his supporters, he answered simply, “ I think my base is so strong, I’m not sure that I have to do that.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">[<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Jamelle Bouie will answer your questions about this column on Twitter on Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. Eastern: </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/jbouie?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">@jbouie</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em>]</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a result, the narrow coalition that put him in office is even narrower. The 2018 backlash that gave Democrats a majority in the House of Representatives was built on major gains in Republican-leaning suburbs throughout the country, as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/opinion/sunday/trump-youth-vote.html?fbclid=IwAR3ufDQvjQB5cKlswRB8vZal1oRADbYUGdnKQrLEI-rQagm8Z1WXlORYTA8&amp;module=inline" title="">a small but still substantial number</a> of 2016 Trump voters either cast a ballot for Democrats or didn’t vote at all.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump’s approval rating <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">is nearly 1</a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">0 points under water</a>, meaning that over all, people disapprove of his performance as president by a large margin (52.3 to 42.7 percent); in several recent polls <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/national_general_election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">he loses hypothetical </a>matchups with Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg; and as of April, 52 percent of registered voters <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/29/most-americans-say-they-wont-vote-trump-next-year-will-they-vote-all/?utm_term=.a432b6ab370c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said they “definitely” wouldn’t vote for him in 2020</a>. He still has the economy on his side, but if the president doesn’t try to reach out to voters outside of his base — if he doesn’t try to appeal to Democrats and Republicans who rejected him in 2016 — there’s a good chance he’ll lose re-election.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/jamellebouie?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet.

Is there anything he could do to bring them to his side, or will he force them to support the Democratic nominee for lack of a better alternative?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One option is to reject the conservative policymaking of his first term and embrace the more moderate approach he promised as a candidate. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/245813/leans-conservative-liberals-keep-recent-gains.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Thirty-five percent of Americans</a> identify as “moderate,” and they might be receptive to a Trump who promised to pursue consensus and pragmatism instead of division and far-right ideological crusades.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump, for example, could try to cut a deal on health care. Fifty-six percent of Americans favor a “national health plan in which all Americans would get their insurance from a single government plan,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kff.org/slideshow/public-opinion-on-single-payer-national-health-plans-and-expanding-access-to-medicare-coverage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to an April survey</a> from the Kaiser Family Foundation. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://morningconsult.com/2019/07/02/majority-backs-medicare-for-all-replacing-private-plans-if-preferred-providers-stay/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">A more recent poll</a> from Morning Consult, taken after the first round of Democratic presidential debates, shows 46 percent support for a “Medicare for all” system that diminishes the role of private insurers, but majority support (55 percent, including 56 percent of independents and 26 percent of Republicans) for one that allows you to keep your doctor and hospital.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In theory, this is fertile ground for a compromise, a chance for Trump to deliver the “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-healthcare-20160303-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">beautiful</a>” health care he promised during the campaign. He could give up his unpopular and divisive attempt to repeal Obamacare and take the moderate path of Medicare expansion. If “Medicare for all” is too much, there’s also “Medicare for most,” which would allow consumers to buy into the program as an option on the exchanges. If he wants to aim directly for the center, he could urge Republican lawmakers in states like Alabama, Florida and South Carolina to adopt the Medicaid expansion and extend health insurance to their most disadvantaged residents.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the economy, Trump could reach out to moderate voters with a minimum-wage increase. In a January <!-- -->poll from The Hill<!-- -->, 55 percent of registered voters <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/426780-poll-a-majority-of-voters-want-a-15-minimum-wage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said they would support</a> raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour from $7.25. While only 36 percent of Republicans supported $15 per hour, 70 percent said they would support a lesser but still significant raise. Only 14 percent of registered voters want the minimum wage to stay the same and only 5 percent think it should be reduced or eliminated. In the same survey, an even larger number of voters — 59 percent — said that they <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/425422-a-majority-of-americans-support-raising-the-top-tax-rate-to-70" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">support</a> a 70 percent tax rate on the amount of income over $10 million. By adopting both policies, Trump could claim the middle and grow his coalition beyond its current confines.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finally there’s immigration. Trump has made draconian border policies the centerpiece of his administration, at the cost of alienating much of the public. He is trapped in a bubble, unable to see the facts: that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/07/02/rel8b.-.trump,.immigration.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a large majority of Americans</a> support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, oppose a wall along the southern border and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/07/02/rel8b.-.trump,.immigration.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">disapprove</a> of how the federal government has treated migrants attempting to cross into the United States. Most Americans, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2019/images/07/02/rel8b.-.trump,.immigration.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">likewise</a>, would allow refugees from Central American countries to continue to seek asylum.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here is another opportunity to claim the middle. The president could abandon his harsh immigration policies and adopt the measured, more humane approach favored by most of the public.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As it stands, all of this is obviously unlikely. It’s also striking to see how far the president is from the center of American politics. The most expansive Democratic proposals for strengthening the social safety net are far closer to the political mainstream than the great majority of Trump’s actions as president. And he shows no sign of changing course. Trump is still committed to his base, still obsessed with mobilizing his strongest supporters. This may get big crowds in friendly territory, but it might not be enough to win a second term in 2020.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A majority of the American electorate — liberals, moderates and even some conservatives — want a greater government role in health care, a higher minimum wage, higher taxes on the rich and less punitive border policies. If Trump isn’t going to move to the center, then their only choice should be the party that, no matter its nominee, backs each item on that list.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
