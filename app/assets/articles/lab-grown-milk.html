<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent years, the alternatives to conventional cows’ milk have proliferated. The local grocery store is likely to offer any number of plant-based options: milks made from soy, almonds, oats, rice, hemp, coconuts, cashews, pea plants <!-- -->and more<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But most nondairy milks pale in comparison to cows’ milk. Plant-based milks are made by breaking down plants and reconstituting their proteins in water to resemble the fluid from a lactating bovine. These proteins differ fundamentally from true dairy proteins, and the results — milks, cheeses and yogurts in name only — often fail to <!-- -->measure up<!-- --> in color, taste or texture. Inja Radman, a molecular biologist and a founder of New Culture, a food company, put it plainly. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Vegan cheese is just terrible,” she said. “As scientists, we know why it doesn’t work. It doesn’t have the crucial dairy proteins.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dairy tastes like dairy thanks to two key proteins, casein and whey protein. Researchers at several start-up companies, including New Culture, have begun producing these proteins in the lab, with the aim of creating a new grocery store category: <!-- -->cow<!-- -->-free dairy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their process is loosely comparable to the way<!-- --> Impossible Foods or Beyond <!-- -->Meat makes meatless burgers<!-- -->. <!-- -->Microbes, such as yeast, are given the genetic instructions to produce the dairy proteins<!-- -->. The microbes are then<!-- --> cultivated en masse<!-- -->, with nutrients added and the temperature adjusted. Eventually the organisms start churning out large quantities of the proteins,<!-- --> and these are isolated and added to various recipes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the Impossible Burger, the essential protein is a molecule called heme, which is abundant in animal muscles and gives the burger its meaty flavor, and even makes it appear to bleed. New Culture is focusing on producing casein, a protein that coagulates to give mozzarella cheese its stretchy texture. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Radman said the <!-- -->company had conducted<!-- --> double-blind tests to see if <!-- -->people could tell the difference between the proof-of-concept cheese and store-bought mozzarella. “We’ve had really positive results,”<!-- --> she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The quest for cow-free dairy is expanding. In Oakland, scientists at a community science lab are trying to make their own <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://realvegancheese.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">open-source recipe</a> for lab-made cheese. And a start-up in Boston called Motif Ingredients is engineering a variety of proteins from dairy, eggs and meat.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another company, Perfect Day (originally Muufri), may be the furthest along in perfecting a recipe for lab-made dairy. The company produces whey protein and mixes them with other ingredients found in traditional dairy — fats, carbohydrates, calcium and phosphates. In early July, a limited-edition batch was released, with flavors including <!-- -->chocolate, vanilla salted fudge and vanilla blackberry toffee<!-- -->; it quickly <!-- -->sold out.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hundreds of thousands of metric tons of whey and casein are consumed in the United States each year, virtually all of it produced by dairy farms. Proponents of lab-made milk see the product appealing to dairy lovers broadly, while satisfying concerns about animal welfare and environmental sustainability. But t<!-- -->o make a real impact on the planet, <!-- -->and eliminate the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/07/can-methane-burps-be-bred-out-of-cows/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">carbon emissions from all those belching cows</a>, a great many microbes will need to be corralled.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The challenge is scaling up. Perfect Day plans to sell its lab-made whey to ice cream-makers, dairy companies and restaurants rather than directly to consumers. It has also <!-- -->partnered with agriculture giant Archer Daniels Midland, <!-- -->with its industrial-scale fermentation infrastructure<!-- -->, to try to meet market demand<!-- --> and reduce the cost of producing proteins.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s what the two of us spend the most of our time on now,” said Perumal Ghandi, a founder of Perfect Day. “Sure, we have A.D.M., but even if we max them out, <!-- -->it’s still just a drop in the bucket.<!-- -->”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And there is already stiff competition from plant-based dairy alternatives, which offer similar environmental benefits and have gained popularity among consumers. Sales of plant-based milks <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://plantbasedfoods.org/2019-data-plant-based-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">jumped 6 percent last year</a>, and now make up 13 percent of the entire milk category, according to data from the <!-- -->Plant Based Foods Association and The Good Food Institute<!-- -->. Sales of plant-based ice cream and <!-- -->frozen <!-- -->desserts grew 27 percent; plant-based cheese grew 19 percent, and plant-based yogurt grew 39 percent.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“All of a sudden people are realizing that they don’t have to depend on cows for milk,” said Cheryl Mitchell, head of research and development at Elmhurst Milked, one of New York City’s largest dairy companies, which switched to making nut milks in 2016.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Technology has also improved the taste of plant-based milks and decreased the amount of water needed to produce several of them. “We want to be increasing our agricultural diversity to help environmental sustainability, not just relying on one source,” Dr. Mitchell said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beyond Meat and Impossible Burger have been popular with consumers. Whether lab-made milk can replicate that success is an open question.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What helped the Impossible Burger was their <!-- -->lab-made heme<!-- -->, which had a tremendous impact on both the flavor and visual appearance of the burger,” said Sam Alcaine, a food scientist at Cornell University. “I don’t know if lab-made dairy can make that leap and make consumers notice a difference in their dairy products.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Labeling also has a big impact. The Food and Drug Administration has a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=135.110" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">legal standard for what can be called “ice cream,”</a> Dr. Alcaine said. Officially, ice cream must contain no less than 10 percent<!-- --> milk fat (or cream) from a cow. Perfect Day products have <!-- -->none; they contain coconut oil and sunflower oil instead, to remain animal-free, and <!-- -->must be labeled<!-- --> <!-- -->“frozen dairy dessert,” not “ice cream.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dairy farmers are also likely to push back, lobbying for stronger laws governing the labeling of lab-made products, as they have <!-- -->done for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/business/milk-nut-juice-plant-beverage-label.html?module=inline" title="">plant-based milks</a>.<!-- --> Cattle ranchers have already introduced bills in 24 states that, if passed, would make it <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/technology/meat-veggie-burgers-lab-produced.html?module=inline" title="">illegal to use the word “meat</a>” to describe burgers and sausages made from plants or grown in labs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the founders of Perfect Day are not concerned. They say that their dairy <!-- -->products <!-- --> will prove more popular than plant-based alternatives, to vegans, vegetarians, dairy lovers and everyone in between.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’ve spoken to folks from dairy before,” Mr. Pandya said. “By and large there’s a feeling that this could help, because there are so many consumers leaving dairy to consume plant alternatives, whereas we are making something that is still dairy at heart.” He added, “There’s an opportunity here for a whole new category of food.”</p>
