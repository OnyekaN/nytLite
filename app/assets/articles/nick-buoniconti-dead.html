He was 78.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The son, Marc Buoniconti, the president of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.themiamiproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Miami Project to Cure Paralysis</a>, which his father helped found, announced the death. His said his father had been in hospice care.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2015 doctors told Nick Buoniconti that he showed symptoms of dementia. Two years later he agreed to donate his brain to researchers at Boston University. They are to determine if his repeated head injuries as a player caused chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As of 2017, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/sports/football/nfl-cte.html?module=inline" title="">the university’s C.T.E. Center had found the disease</a> in 110 of the 111 former N.F.L. players’ brains it had examined.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m positive that football caused this,” Buoniconti said in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hbo.com/video/documentaries/the-many-lives-of-nick-buoniconti/videos/fiery-competitor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“The Many Lives of Nick Buoniconti”</a> (2019), an HBO documentary. In an interview for the film, he showed his frustration with the halting speech that his dementia had caused.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m not mad at the game, I’m mad at the owners,” he said. “I think that we paved the way for the N.F.L. being what it is today. In other words, we, uh, we paved the way for them and they’re, they’re reaping all the benefits.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added, “Sorry, I’m not, uh, I’m not, uh, coherent.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For many years Buoniconti was an intelligent, articulate and tough player for the Boston Patriots (now the New England Patriots) and the Dolphins, winning All-Pro honors five times in a 14-year pro football career. A former All-American at the University of Notre Dame, he anchored the Dolphins’ vaunted “No-Name Defense” under Coach Don Shula.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Afterward he became a lawyer, a player agent, a TV sports personality, a corporate executive and the lead voice of the Miami Project.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Marc Buoniconti severely injured his spinal cord in a college football game in 1985. For more than 30 years afterward, Buoniconti helped raise nearly $500 million for spinal cord and brain research carried out by the organization. He also played a critical role in directing the research and was a charismatic motivator of scientists and researchers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Barth Green, a neurosurgeon and longtime chairman of the Miami Project, said in a phone interview: “People are walking now because of cellular transplants and the latest neuroengineering and bioengineering that has been applied to humans with disability. Nick was a stimulating force in that area, from bench to bedside. And this is someone who probably never took a science course.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nicholas Anthony Buoniconti Jr. was born on Dec. 15, 1940, in Springfield, Mass., to Nicholas Sr. and Pasqualina (Mercolino) Buoniconti. They ran an Italian bakery, Mercolino’s, in Springfield’s South End. If not for his athletic skills, Buoniconti said, he might have spent the rest of his life working at the bakery, making fresh bread every morning as his father and grandfather had.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He had three things going for him,” his brother Peter said in the HBO documentary. “He was the best athlete in the South End, he was one of the smartest kids in the South End, and he was the toughest kid in the South End. So he was just a special kid.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nick excelled as an undersized linebacker at Notre Dame. But his coach, Joe Kuharich, did not recommend him to National Football League scouts; Kuharich felt that at 5-foot-11 and 210 pounds, Buoniconti was too small for the N.F.L. Kuharich told him to set his sights on the American Football League, which had started in 1960 as an audacious challenge to the older N.F.L.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buoniconti did, and was drafted by the Patriots in the 13th round of the 1962 A.F.L. draft. The N.F.L. did not draft him at all.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a Patriot, he was an All-Pro four times and led the team in tackles and interceptions in his seven seasons with Boston. He distinguished himself off the field by studying at the Suffolk University School of Law in Boston to prepare for his post-playing career, graduating in 1968.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Once I got my law degree, I was determined not to let football rule me,” he said in the HBO documentary.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was traded to the Dolphins in 1969 and contemplated retiring. But he agreed to a long-term deal with the team, joining a young roster. Miami went 3-10-1 in his first season, but the team’s fortunes changed the next year, when Shula guided it to a 10-4 record.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was the start of a memorable run of success for the Dolphins. After the A.F.L.-N.F.L. merger, they were American Football Conference champions in 1971, though they lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl VI. And in 1972 they went undefeated, capping what became a 17-0 season with a 14-7 victory over the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII in January 1973. No team since then has gone undefeated for an entire season (though the Patriots came close in 2008, when their 18-0 run ended with a Super Bowl loss to the Giants.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buoniconti became the only member of Miami’s No-Name Defense to be elected to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.profootballhof.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We were embarrassed by how we played against the Cowboys,”<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/22/30-seconds-with-nick-buoniconti/" title=""> Buoniconti told The New York Times</a> in 2012. “The fact that we were undefeated was accidental. It happened. We also had skills and luck and great coaching. It was more chemistry than ability.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Dolphins won the next Super Bowl as well, beating the Minnesota Vikings, 24-7.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buoniconti finished playing after the 1976 season, pleased to have retired with his health.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My last game, I got on my hands and knees and kissed the ground and thanked God that I’d never gotten seriously hurt,” he said in an interview with<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.si.com/mmqb/2017/05/08/nick-buoniconti-dolphins-cognitive-decline-nfl-head-trauma-concussions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> Sports Illustrated </a>in 2017. He estimated that he had absorbed 520,000 hits to his head.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He used his law degree for several years in private practice, where his work included representing athletes, among them the baseball player Andre Dawson, then of the Montreal Expos, in contract negotiations. In 1979, he started a 23-year run as a host of the HBO Sports series “Inside the NFL,” teaming up with Len Dawson, the former quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And in 1983, he joined United States Tobacco as a senior vice president, earning 10 times the salary he had received in his best years in the N.F.L.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buoniconti famously defended the company’s smokeless tobacco products as safe. In a segment of “60 Minutes” in 1986, he told the correspondent Ed Bradley that there had been no scientific proof that smokeless tobacco had caused oral cancer, though Mr. Bradley pointed to studies that had done just that. Despite the shaky performance — which he later regretted — he was soon promoted to president of the company.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But by then, Marc Buoniconti had been<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/living/health-fitness/article177562581.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> critically injured</a> while playing linebacker for The Citadel, the military college in Charleston, S.C., during a game against East Tennessee State in Johnson City, Tenn., in October 1985. He was left paralyzed from the neck down.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nick Buoniconti eventually left U.S. Tobacco, saying he could no longer devote himself full-time to the company while focusing on his son’s treatments in Miami.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buoniconti’s devotion to the Miami Project — organizing fund-raising events like sports legends dinners, cajoling researchers to find therapies and getting involved in grant applications — became his focus.<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.profootballhof.com/nick-buoniconti-1940-2019/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> When he was inducted into the<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Hall of Fame</a>, in Canton, Ohio, he reminded the audience that he was wearing the Super Bowl ring that commemorated the Dolphins’ undefeated season.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I would trade this ring in and all my individual accomplishments if one thing could happen in my lifetime,” he said. “My son Marc dreams that he walks, and as a father I would like nothing more than to be by his side.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to Marc, Mr. Buoniconti is survived by his wife, Lynn (Weiss) Buoniconti; his daughter, Gina Buoniconti; another son, Nicholas III; a stepson, Justin Weiss; four grandchildren; and his brothers Robert and Peter. His marriage to Terry Salamano ended in divorce.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buoniconti began showing signs of dementia in 2013. He had trouble with his memory and balance. He fell frequently. Two years later he showed symptoms <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.si.com/mmqb/2017/05/08/nick-buoniconti-dolphins-cognitive-decline-nfl-head-trauma-concussions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">suggesting dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and C.T.E.</a> Further testing pointed increasingly to the likelihood of C.T.E., which is characterized by elevated amounts of a protein, tau, that slowly kills brain cells. C.T.E. can be definitively diagnosed only in an autopsy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Buoniconti’s final years, Marc provided the sort of emotional support that his father had given him after his catastrophic injury.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">”Well, I should’ve been dead years ago,” he said in the HBO documentary. “It’s only because of my father that I’m here today. It’s only because of my father that I”m able to live the life that I do.”</p>
