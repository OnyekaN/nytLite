This wasteland was on St. Martin, an island that took a direct hit from Hurricane Irma on Sept. 6, 2017, and where, two years later, recovery is still far from complete.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The hurricane caused billions of dollars in damage across the 34-square-mile island, which is split between the French territory of Saint-Martin, with a population of about 32,000,<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>and Sint Maarten, a mostly autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with a population of about 41,000. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Immediately after the storm blasted the island, President Emmanuel Macron of France promised a speedy recovery for the French side.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Saint-Martin will be reborn, I am committed,” Mr. Macron vowed. “We will do it quickly, we will do it well, and we will do it better.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Saint-Martin’s slow, if steady, recovery shows just how difficult coming back from a hurricane can be on a small island, with challenges that go well beyond just the size of financial aid packages.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Saint-Martin, the toughest, most uncomfortable questions are less about who will pay for rebuilding — France has delivered more than a half-billion dollars of aid — but where and how to rebuild, or whether to rebuild at all amid the threat of evermore powerful storms. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This has made the debate less an economic one and more about politics, class, culture and race, often pitting the local majority-black population against the French state.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The top French official on the island says she wants more restrictions on construction in the areas most at risk to future storms, in order to protect lives and the economy. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But many working-class residents fear they could be forced to abandon property that has been in their family for generations. Some suspect a land grab, where their waterfront plots will be taken and sold to wealthy developers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a region that has experienced the awesome forces of Category 5 storms with terrifying frequency in recent years, <!-- -->the story playing out on St. Martin is likely to be repeated on many other Caribbean islands — and in the United States, too.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the French side of the island, Hurricane Irma damaged about 95 percent of the buildings, including the home of Bernadette Carty.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Carty had lived all her 65 years on the waterfront, and she felt it was safe to ignore the evacuation orders that preceded Irma’s landfall. After all, at least seven generations of her family had survived numerous hurricanes on this same patch of land, and she figured this time would be no different.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Irma was among the most powerful storms ever to hit the island, and a prime example of how <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/03/climate/hurricane-dorian-climate-change.html?module=inline" title="">climate change has made hurricanes more destructive</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As Irma rumbled ashore, Ms. Carty, her daughter and two grandchildren dove for cover under a mattress and rode out the storm as it mauled her island.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Irma had finally moved on, the family emerged from their hideaway to discover that the storm surge and wind had gouged holes in two sides of the house and had swept away Ms. Carty’s sister from her home next door. She was one of 11 people who died on the French side of the island, according to the local authorities. Two died on the Dutch side, according to the prime minister’s office.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Carty has been living in a temporary apartment ever since, and hopes to get permission to rebuild her house.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This hurricane is the devil,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The storm devastated the island’s main airport, blocked its ports and effectively shut down the island’s essential tourism industry for months.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The French government’s promise to deliver substantial help was not an empty one.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It allocated more than $500 million in aid and subsidies in the first six months after the storm to the recovery and reconstruction of Saint-Martin and the smaller, nearby French island of Saint-Barthélemy, according to Sylvie Feucher, the French state’s top representative based in the two territories. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Considering the dire shape Saint-Martin was in right after the storm, with its infrastructure flattened, the fact that much of the territory is back on its feet confirms the aid has made a difference.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hotels <!-- -->and<!-- --> restaurants have reopened, and tourists are again lounging on its beaches.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But on a visit to the island in late August, a checkerboard of remaining damage was visible all around. Buildings without roofs. Businesses still shuttered. The half-sunken hulls of storm-scuttled <!-- -->ships<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While Irma battered the island for just a matter of hours, Ms. Feucher predicted that it could take up to three more years for the territory to fully recover.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hurricane Irma made clear that natural disasters not only obliterate structures and lives; they can also expose deep socioeconomic fault lines. In Saint-Martin, a long simmering discontent — loaded with racial and class tension — is on the verge of boiling over.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Feucher, the deputy prefect for Saint-Martin, is convinced that some areas of the territory are just too dangerously exposed to the power of the most severe storms to be safely inhabitable. And she is trying to convince the population of this, too.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The focus of her mission, backed by Paris, is a push for more severe restrictions on construction and land use in the areas at greatest risk of damage during major storms, like that bluff with the pulverized cottages. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the campaign has become a flash point in an increasingly contentious relationship between the French government and a local population bristling against French bureaucracy and overseas control.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several of the flood-prone coastal neighborhoods of greatest concern to Ms. Feucher have large low-income populations, and many residents suspect the French government is waging a veiled campaign to drive poor, black residents off their land through condemnation so it can be sold to developers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cédrick André, a community activist in Sandy Ground, one of the high-risk neighborhoods, views the matter as nothing less than an existential struggle for Saint-Martin’s working-class population.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They want to change everything: the way we live, the way we speak, the way we sex, the way we eat,” said Mr. André, 42. “They want to change who we are.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They are not attacking the people who have their pocket full and can defend themselves,” he added. “They are attacking people without their pocket full.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sandy Ground — bracketed by a bay on one side and a lagoon on the other — was first settled by squatters decades ago, many of them black immigrants from other Caribbean islands.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authorities turned a blind eye to the settlement, allowing it to grow, and now thousands of people live along the neighborhood’s narrow streets and unpaved lanes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Many of us living by the sea, we know the risk,” said Marie Abner, 48, who has lived in the neighborhood since she immigrated from Haiti as a child. “If anything happen, we leave the home. Then we come back.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The French government has set up a fund to buy out property owners living in the highest-risk flood zones, but Ms. Feucher insists that nobody will be forced to sell. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, residents of Sandy Ground, and other neighborhoods with significant working-class populations, like Grand Case and Quartier d’Orléans, are unassuaged and angry.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Daniel Gibbs, president of the local government in Saint-Martin, has demanded that the French state give the community more time to study the issue.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I need to hear the needs of my population — at least the majority of my population,” Mr. Gibbs added. “I think there’s plenty of room for compromise.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On a recent evening, Jah Bash, a Rastafarian farmer, said that the population’s patience with an overbearing French state was wearing thin.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“For me, it’s a conspiracy to take over the island,” said Mr. Bash, whose family has lived in Sandy Ground for five generations. “It’s about wealth.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Protests against the plan could turn violent, Mr. Bash warned. “The only way to get your attention is to do something to you that you fear,” he said. “The country will burn easily.”</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hurricane recovery is hard anywhere. And that’s particularly true in Caribbean islands like St. Martin because of a unique combination of factors.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As with many places in the Caribbean, the economy is over-reliant on a single industry — tourism — for jobs and tax revenue. When hotels are wrecked by a storm, business dries up, unemployment soars and government coffers suffer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Geographic isolation makes everything more expensive. Building materials need to be brought in by ship or plane, increasing costs. The elevated demand for qualified workers in a small labor pool jacks up wages. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Recovery is also hamstrung by the fact that few are left untouched by a severe disaster: The officials responsible for leading the recovery are themselves sometimes fighting to get on their feet.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They are so small that almost every human being on the island is directly impacted,” said Tahseen Sayed,<!-- --> <!-- -->the World Bank country director for the Caribbean. “The challenge of the government for reconstruction becomes even longer and more difficult.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Local governments often lack the resources to manage the task of hurricane recovery alone.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Prime Minister Leona Romeo-Marlin<!-- --> <!-- -->of Sint Maarten said her government had insufficient fiscal, legal and environmental staff to help manage those aspects of recovery after Irma.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The hurricane really exposed those weak areas that we have as a government,” she said.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The island that Saint-Martin and Sint Maarten occupy was divided between the French and the Dutch in the 17th century. As with two competitive siblings close in age, just about everything that happens on one side demands comparison with the other.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hurricane recovery has been no different, revealing that distinctions in culture and governance have had a significant bearing on progress during the past two years.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The consensus view on both sides of the island is that the Dutch half has recovered more quickly. A higher percentage of hotel rooms on the Dutch side, for example, are open again for business.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The French state runs a famously laborious bureaucracy that, according to residents, has slowed the rebuilding process.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We have norms and rules and regulations on the French side,” said Angèle Dormoy, the president of Saint-Martin’s Chamber of Commerce. “Everything is controlled and re-controlled, three or four times.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In contrast, Sint Maarten has developed a more laissez-faire culture, helping to accelerate the rebuilding process.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the French state may seem overbearing to some in Saint-Martin, whose residents are French citizens, its people are entitled to all the protections of France’s generous social net. But that state largess may have undermined private initiative during this reconstruction period.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s the strength and weakness of France,” Ms. Feucher said. “We give a lot of attention to the population, and it can prevent people from developing a sense of responsibility in terms of taking care of themselves.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the Dutch side, much of the rebuilding has been driven by private funds, particularly those associated with tourism, which dwarfs the French-side tourism sector.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They pulled up their socks and got on with it,” said Lorraine Talmi, board president of the Sint Maarten Hospitality &amp; Trade Association.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the differences have also left some on the Dutch side wondering whether in their haste to rebuild, and in their comparatively looser regulatory environment, the rebuilding did not happen with enough thought given to withstanding future storms.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the French side, some believe their patience will pay off with a more resilient island, better able to withstand the effects of the Atlantic’s warming waters.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2017, Mr. Macron said Saint-Martin will be “rebuilt in a durable way that also meets seismic and environmental needs.” The widespread destruction, he said, could be blamed in part on “buildings that were constructed under conditions that wouldn’t have been accepted in other territories of France.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Feucher said she was trying to get the population to take the long view in these matters: that getting the rebuilding right, even if it takes time, could save lives in the next big storm.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Ms. Feucher<!-- --> conceded that persuading people to accept new regulations is no easy task.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Changing mentalities is always difficult,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The Takeaway</strong>: As storms become more destructive, hurricane recovery is as much about rethinking as it is rebuilding.</p>
