<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook and the publishing industry have long been frenemies: Occasionally they teamed up, but mostly they competed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now the two sides have formed an uneasy truce.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facebook on Friday unveiled Facebook News, its latest foray into digital publishing. The product is a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/technology/facebook-news-humans.html?module=inline" title="">new section of the social network’s mobile app</a> that is dedicated entirely to news content, which the company is betting will bring users back to the site regularly to consume news on sports, entertainment, politics and tech.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facebook News will offer stories from a mix of publications, including The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, as well as digital-only outlets like BuzzFeed and Business Insider. Some stories will be chosen by a team of professional journalists, while others will be tailored to readers’ interests over time using Facebook’s machine-learning technology.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We feel acute responsibility because there’s obviously an awareness that the internet has disrupted the news industry business model,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, said in an interview. “We’ve figured out a different way to do this that we think is going to be better and more sustainable.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facebook will pay for a range of content from dozens of publishers — including striking some deals well into the millions of dollars — and get local news from smaller publishers in metropolitan markets like Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami and Atlanta.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Mark Zuckerberg seems personally and professionally committed to ensuring that high-quality journalism has a viable, valued future,” Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corporation, said in a statement. “It is absolutely appropriate that premium journalism is recognized and rewarded.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another Facebook News partner is Breitbart, the far-right digital publisher. Unlike The Times, The Washington Post and several other paid partners, Breitbart will not be paid, and only articles the site posts on Facebook will be eligible for the tab.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the inclusion of Breitbart, which its former chairman Steve Bannon once called “a platform for the alt-right,” provoked outrage from some political activists.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Today, @facebook, who is still ensnared in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, added Breitbart, whose owner and former President were OWNERS of Cambridge Analytica, as a ‘trusted’ news source,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/1187736761717460992?s=21" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">tweeted Sleeping Giants</a>, a digital watchdog that monitors advertisers on Breitbart. “This scandal writes itself.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The relationship between Facebook and publishers has been strained. Because Facebook and Google dominate the online advertising market, taking in together as much as 80 percent of the revenue, publishers have viewed the tech giants as stymieing their digital expansions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facebook has over the years courted publishers for different journalism initiatives, like Instant Articles — a product in which publishers provided articles that appeared entirely within Facebook — and Facebook Live, which paid newsrooms to hire teams of journalists to use and promote Facebook’s live video products.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But those relationships soured as Facebook often shifted its strategy, leaving publishers feeling abused when the social network abandoned its original plans. After heavily promoting partnerships for video projects, for instance, Facebook decided not to renew some video deals with publishers — with catastrophic effects. Mic, a digital publisher aimed at targeting news-hungry millennials, was forced to sell itself at a deeply discounted valuation after its video content deals were not renewed by Facebook.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged the tension between Facebook and publishers, and he said past experiences informed his current approach.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s not a one-time thing,” he said of the new partnerships with publishers. “That’s why the deals we are structuring are long-term commitments, not two months, not one year, but multiple years.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added, “We think we’ve worked out the formula through all these conversations where we now can sustainably pay for content.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last week, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/business/zuckerberg-facebook-free-speech.html?module=inline" title="">Mr. Zuckerberg delivered a speech at Georgetown</a> in which he extolled the virtues of free speech across Facebook. He vigorously defended the company’s decision not to fact-check political ads from politicians on the social network.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new Facebook News effort is being led by Campbell Brown, a veteran television journalist who covered politics for NBC and CNN before joining Facebook as head of news partnerships.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most of the publishing industry’s recent financial struggles can be traced to a shift toward digital ad revenue, which has not compensated for the loss of print ad revenue. Though the tech giants are not the only reason that publishers’ revenues have eroded, even small tweaks in Facebook’s algorithms have an outsize effect on publishers’ web traffic. So when publishers designed their corporate strategies around the whims of the Facebook News Feed, their traffic sometimes plummeted when Facebook changed tack.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a memo sent to the staff of The New York Times, the company’s chief executive, Mark Thompson, and its chief operating officer, Meredith Kopit Levien, described Facebook News as a “step change” in the company’s financial dealings with digital platforms.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We have long argued that the major platforms derive substantial value from the presence of high-quality journalism and should help support the economics that make that journalism possible,” they wrote. “We welcome the fact that Facebook has taken a lead here.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The two Times executives, who did not disclose the specifics of the deal with the social network, said they saw Facebook News as complementary with, rather than competitive to, the goal of growing digital subscriptions to 10 million by 2025. The Times currently has 4.7 million subscribers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facebook is not alone in now choosing to elevate original reporting. Last month, Google <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/business/media/google-algorithm-original-reporting.html?module=inline" title="">announced</a> that it would give priority to articles that broke news or that had invested considerable resources into reporting over imitative aggregation. Google made clear that the decision was not purely altruistic. Highlighting original reporting, an executive suggested, would make users more likely to trust Google and keep going back to the search goliath.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In March, Apple also introduced a paid news subscription product, Apple News Plus, which provides articles from an array of publishers and costs $10 a month. But many publishers balked at Apple’s terms when it asked for a 50 percent cut of all subscription revenue earned. Though <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/technology/apple-news-wall-street-journal.html?module=inline" title="">News Corporation joined Apple’s product</a>, other companies — including The Times and The Washington Post — did not.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With Facebook News, the social network said it wanted to avoid some missteps of past news products, which relied heavily on algorithmically generated suggestions without any selection from professional journalists.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People want and benefit from personalized experiences on Facebook, but we know there is reporting that transcends individual experience,” Ms. Brown said in a blog post. “We want to support both.”</p>
