<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There he goes again.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This weekend, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, sat down with Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday” to try to bind some of the gaping wounds he’d inflicted on President Trump’s impeachment defense in recent days. Instead, Mr. Mulvaney again flubbed his lines, making himself look even more inept and dishonest. Yet this alone does not fully address why the White House ringmaster now finds himself an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trumps-envoy-tells-congress-the-president-outsourced-ukraine-policy-to-giuliani/2019/10/17/484b30d0-f0ee-11e9-b648-76bcf86eb67e_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">object of ridicule</a> even among members of his own party — a situation for which he is only partly to blame.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Mulvaney’s adventure began on Thursday at a news briefing held so that he could explain why Mr. Trump’s decision to host next year’s Group of 7 summit at the struggling Trump Doral golf resort in Miami was not another bit of naked self-dealing — or, as Mr. Trump himself put it on Monday, not a violation of “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/466732-trump-dismisses-phony-emoluments-clause-after-doral-criticism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">this phony Emoluments clause</a>.” After a deluge of criticism from Republicans, Mr. Trump reversed the decision on Saturday, blaming “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1185726930764611589" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the Hostile Media &amp; their Democrat Partners</a>” for causing a fuss.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Journalists being the impertinent nudges they are<!-- -->, Mr. Mulvaney soon found himself fielding questions about impeachment. Next thing you know, he’s peevishly lecturing everyone that not only had Mr. Trump’s order to withhold aid money from Ukraine been partly contingent on Ukraine agreeing to investigate his political enemies but that this sort of thing happens all the time. “I have news for everybody: <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/politics/defiant-mulvaney-ukraine.html?module=inline" title="">Get over it,</a>” he <!-- -->snipped.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, while Mr. Trump’s apologists have not yet settled on a precise rationalization for why the president pressured a foreign government to meddle in American elections, some defenders have clung to the position that there was no quid pro quo. As such, Mr. Mulvaney’s admission, delivered on camera and in front of the press corps, was not met with universal acclaim within Trumpworld.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/debatable?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[The big debates, distilled.

He started out insisting that people were misstating what he had said, but Mr. Wallace was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/10/20/chris_wallace_grills_mick_mulvaney_you_said_what_you_said_did_you_offer_to_resign.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">having none of it.</a> “You were asked specifically by Jonathan Karl [of ABC News], Was investigating Democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aid — was that part of the quid pro quo? And you said, ‘It happens all the time.’” This sent Mr. Mulvaney spinning even more furiously, to which Mr. Wallace responded, “I hate to go through this, but you said what you said.” Mr. Mulvaney could protest all he wanted. Mr. Wallace had video receipts.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The acting chief wasn’t much better at trying to explain why Mr. Trump thought it a good idea to hold the Group of 7 gathering at one of his company’s resorts. “At the end of the day, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-ukraine.html?module=inline" title="">he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business,</a>” Mr. Mulvaney said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-ukraine.html?module=inline" title="">Reviews</a> of Mr. Mulvaney’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/20/mick-mulvaney-impeachment-white-house-052708" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Sunday gig</a> were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/mick-mulvaney-fox-news-sunday-ukraine-901430/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">not kind</a>, even among the president’s friends and advisers — one of whom characterized it to Politico as “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/20/mick-mulvaney-impeachment-white-house-052708" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a self-immolation</a>.” For weeks, word around Washington has been that Mr. Mulvaney has lost favor at the White House. The past few days have kicked speculation into high gear about how much longer he can hang on.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s easy to mock Mr. Mulvaney’s missteps. He has emerged as one of Mr. Trump’s top go-to guys for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/mulvaney-emerges-as-a-key-facilitator-of-the-campaign-to-pressure-ukraine/2019/10/15/9d46b7ae-ef76-11e9-89eb-ec56cd414732_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">carrying out questionable orders</a>, such as taking the practical steps necessary to withhold Ukraine’s aid money or shove aside career diplomats in favor of political lackeys. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But, in Mr. Mulvaney’s defense, he should never have been put in this position. The guy who’s doing the dirty work should not also be the guy expected to go out and defend it to a roomful of journalists. That’s what a press secretary is for — preferably a professional steeped in the dark art of ensorcelling the Fourth Estate. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Seriously, does anyone think <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/books/sarah-huckabee-sanders-memoir.html?module=inline" title="">Sarah Huckabee Sanders</a>, in her turn as Mr. Trump’s chief spinner, would have been goaded into admitting a presidential quid pro quo and then admonish everyone for being naïve about that sort of thing? Of course not. She was too adept at dodging, deflecting and flat-out lying to blurt out such an inconvenient truth. If nothing else, she would have pleaded ignorance of the details — which would have been a tougher sell for Mr. Mulvaney given his role as a recurring character in the Ukraine shenanigans.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here we see a concrete downside to the White House’s slapdash approach to staffing, its disdain for professionalism and this president’s conviction that, because he’s such a communications whiz, he doesn’t need a message team backing him up.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not that you’ll hear journalists complaining. While they may long for the days of regular White House briefings, they know that a more seasoned communications gatekeeper would never have stumbled as Mr. Mulvaney has.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At work on Monday morning, Mr. Mulvaney received applause from senior aides, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/21/politics/mulvaney-chief-of-staff-cabinet-trump/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">CNN reported</a>.
