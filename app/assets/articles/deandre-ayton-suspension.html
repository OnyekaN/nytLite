<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Deandre Ayton of the Phoenix Suns has been suspended without pay for 25 games for a violation of the terms of the N.B.A.’s drug program, the league announced on Thursday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ayton, 21, tested positive for a banned diuretic, according to the league. His suspension is scheduled to begin with tomorrow’s game between the Phoenix Suns and the Denver Nuggets.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The No. 1 pick in the 2018 draft, Ayton made the all-rookie team last year <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/a/aytonde01.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">with averages of 16.3 points, 10.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists a game</a>. In Wednesday’s season opener against Sacramento, he played well, collecting 18 points, 11 rebounds and 4 blocks in the Suns’ 124-95 victory. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ayton, who practiced with the Suns on Thursday and was expected to travel with the team to Denver for Friday’s game, issued a statement about the suspension.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I want to apologize to my family, the entire Suns organization, my teammates, partners, our fans and the Phoenix community,” he said. “This was an unintentional mistake, and unfortunately I put something in my body that I was completely unaware of.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Suns General Manager James Jones issued a statement, saying he and Coach Monty Williams are disappointed by Ayton’s actions, which they believe do not uphold the standards of the team.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“His actions are not taken lightly,” Jones said. “We are committed to ensuring that Deandre understands the profound impact it has had on the team, organization, and Suns community.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ayton said he would work with the N.B.A. Players Association to go through the arbitration process in search of a “positive resolution,” which would presumably be a reduction in the length of the suspension. If Ayton were to miss all 25 games, it would cost him just over $2 million in salary.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A native of the Bahamas, Ayton played a single season for the University of Arizona before declaring for the draft. He is part of a young core for the Suns that, thanks to the addition of a few key veterans, came into this season with hopes of ending Phoenix’s streak of five losing seasons.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Marc Stein contributed reporting.</p>
