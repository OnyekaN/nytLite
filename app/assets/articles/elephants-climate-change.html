<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Poaching destabilizes nations, disrupts ecosystems and threatens biodiversity. A recent study suggests still another consequence: Some types of poaching may also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0395-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">accelerate climate change</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Forest elephants — the smaller, endangered relatives of African savanna elephants — promote the growth of large trees that excel at storing carbon, according to research published in the journal Nature Geoscience. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Should forest elephants disappear, scientists estimated, Central Africa’s rain forest will lose about three billion tons of <!-- -->carbon<!-- --> — the equivalent of France’s total CO2 emissions for 27 years.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This new paper points to something that we in Central Africa have suspected for a long time, but now this group has thrown some serious science at the issue,” said Fiona Maisels, a conservation scientist at the Wildlife Conservation Society and at the University of Stirling in Scotland. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“With the loss of forest elephants,” she added, “loss of carbon stocks can be added to the list of ecosystem services that are no longer provided by these animals.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over recent years, researchers have gained a more detailed understanding of the links between animals and climate. <!-- -->Wild grazers, for instance, can reduce the intensity and frequency of fires that emit greenhouse gases. Methane emissions from livestock significantly contribute to global warming.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists have also known for decades that large herbivores such as elephants play important short-term roles in ecosystems by promoting biodiversity, recycling nutrients and dispersing seeds. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fabio Berzaghi, an ecologist at the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences in France and the lead author of the new study, suspected that elephants might also play a profound long-term role in shaping Africa’s rain forest, second in size only to the Amazon’s. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Amazon <!-- -->lost its large herbivores 12,000 years ago<!-- -->, among them ground sloths that weighed over three tons, elephant-like creatures called gomphotheres, and armadillo-like glyptodonts that were the size of small cars. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The loss of these and other large herbivores likely contributed to the Amazon’s higher density of smaller trees, with a lower overall amount of vegetation compared with Africa’s rain forest.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We were thinking elephants may play a role in the differences between these two continents’ forests,” Dr. Berzaghi said. “We also really wanted to know what the long-term consequences of losing this species would be.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Berzaghi and his colleagues selected two field sites. One lies in the Democratic Republic of Congo, from which elephants disappeared 30 years ago because of poaching; <!-- -->the other is the Republic of Congo<!-- -->, where elephants lived at high numbers until recently. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Both sites were relatively pristine and differed only in the presence or absence of elephants. The researchers measured the trunk size of all the trees in the study areas and noted the species, giving them an idea of the short-term effects of elephant loss.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To determine the long-term effects, they created a computer model that simulated the basic functions of the African rain forest, including tree growth and death, competition, photosynthesis and reproduction. The model allowed them to include or exclude elephants.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Forest elephants almost exclusively stomp down trees with a diameter of 12 inches or less, and they prefer to eat fast-growing softwood trees. By clearing the understory of vegetation, the researchers found, elephants not only alter plant composition but also affect light penetration and water availability. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This results in an ecosystem that favors large, slow-growing hardwood trees. Such species store significantly more carbon than the equivalent volume of smaller softwood trees. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“As a tree, there’s a trade-off — you can’t have it all,” Dr. Berzaghi said. “You either invest in growing fast, or in building a lot of structure with carbon to be more resistant.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Extrapolating their findings to the whole of Africa’s rain forest, Dr. Berzaghi and his colleagues found that the disappearance of elephants would result in a 7 percent loss of vegetation — the equivalent of 3 billion tons of carbon storage. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Put another way, elephants provide a carbon storage service <!-- -->valued at $43 billion.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is the first study I have seen attributing large, multi-megaton changes in carbon to a particular species,” said Rosie Fisher, a scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who was not involved in the research. “It really opens a new frontier in how we think about interactions between large animals and carbon storage.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Save for a few surviving populations, forest elephants are functionally extinct in almost all of their former 850,000-square-mile habitat. The species declined by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059469" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">62 percent</a> from 2002 to 2011, Dr. Maisels and her colleagues found, and poaching has largely continued unchecked since then. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to Iain Douglas-Hamilton, the founder of Save the Elephants, a conservation organization based in Kenya, the killing has most recently spread to Gabon, which holds half of the world’s remaining forest elephants and was previously protected from poaching by its relative isolation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This study comes at a time when forest elephants are threatened as never before,” Dr. Douglas-Hamilton said. “It is appalling that just as we are beginning to understand how elephants might have a key role in Africa in sequestering carbon, they are under real threat of eradication.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One limitation of the study, Dr. Berzaghi said, is that we do not know how much carbon has already been lost because of the elephants’ decline. But it does seem certain, he added, that putting a stop to poaching and restoring forest elephant populations would bring climate benefits. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There’s evidence mounting that elephants are a key species that benefit not just their ecosystem, but all ecosystems,” he said. “Climate change is a complex issue that will probably require a lot of small solutions, and this might be one of those solutions.”</p>
