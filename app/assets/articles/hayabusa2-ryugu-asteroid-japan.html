<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When last we checked in with Japan’s Hayabusa2 spacecraft in April, it had blown a crater in a large rock that orbits the sun.<!-- --> <!-- -->On Wednesday night (Thursday morning in Japan), the robotic probe went in for a landing, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/haya2e_jaxa/status/1149127163456577536" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">appeared to have successfully touched down</a> on the asteroid’s surface.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hayabusa2 was launched in 2014 to collect samples from Ryugu, an asteroid that orbits the sun between Earth and Mars and has a diameter of just over a half mile. By returning <!-- -->to Earth next year with these specimens, the mission will help scientists seek clues about the solar system’s origins.<!-- --> <!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Earlier in the year, the spacecraft used explosives and a projectile to liberate rock from beneath the asteroid’s outer layers. In the latest operation,<!-- --> it descended to the surface of the asteroid before 9:30 p.m. Eastern time, attempting to swiftly grab a sample of material<!-- --> from the crater it made. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pictures posted by the mission’s managers after the landing showed a scattering of rocks as the spacecraft lifted from the asteroid’s surface.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Following the brief landing, the spacecraft returned to a safe position above Ryugu. It is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/news/schedule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">scheduled to begin its return to Earth</a> with the samples it collected at the end of the year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asteroids are bits and pieces leftover from the disc of gas and dust that formed around the young sun and never quite coalesced into a planet. They contain some almost pristine compounds that help tell what the early solar system was like 4.5 billion years ago.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ryugu, as dark as coal, is a C-type, or carbonaceous, asteroid, meaning it is full of carbon molecules known as organics including possibly amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Such molecules are not always associated with biology and can form from chemical reactions in deep space, but asteroids could have seeded Earth with the organic matter that led to life.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About three-quarters of asteroids in the solar system fall into the C-type.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This space rock was discovered in 1999 and not given a name until 2015. Ryugu is named after Ryugu-jo, or dragon’s palace — a magical undersea palace in a Japanese folk tale.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hayabusa2 already has landed briefly on Ryugu’s surface, in February, and collected samples. But these surface materials have been exposed to the solar system’s weather. Studying them offers scientists a potential picture of Ryugu’s surface. But that debris won’t reveal much about the asteroid’s geological history, just as the topsoil in your yard won’t tell you much about what your neighborhood was like during the last ice age.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Making a crater will offer clues to how asteroids similar to Ryugu respond to being struck by objects.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To create the dent in Ryugu, Hayabusa2 carried an impactor made of copper. According to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/what-to-expect-hayabusa2-sci.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the Planetary Society</a>, a funnel containing plastic explosives hurled the copper projectile into the asteroid’s surface. The blast scattered material above the asteroid, altering an area with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/enjoy/material/press/Hayabusa2_Press20190509_ver6_en4.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a diameter of just over 30 feet and creating a crater with depth of about 6 to 10 feet</a>. The impact also darkened the region and caused some boulders to move.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In short, very quickly.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To collect material from the surface of the asteroid, Hayabusa2 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/topics/20190708e_PPTD_approach3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">targeted a small patch about 65 feet from the crater</a> it created, not within the crater itself. The mission’s scientists think this spot is covered in material ejected from beneath the crater when the blast occurred.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The spacecraft tried to pull samples in through a device called a sampler horn, after firing a small projectile made of the metal tantalum — basically a bullet — at the asteroid’s surface. The landing, bullet firing and attempted collection took about one second, according to the Planetary Society. Hayabusa2 then rose from the surface and returned to a safe distance near Ryugu.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hayabusa2 already did this once in February. Because of that successful operation, the mission’s managers in Japan had to assess whether it was worth risking the spacecraft again. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the spacecraft made low-altitude observations of the landing area in the first half of June, the team concluded that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.hayabusa2.jaxa.jp/en/enjoy/material/press/Hayabusa2_Press20190625_ver5_en2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">conditions were safe enough for a second landing</a>, and that the scientific value of collecting subsurface materials from the asteroid merited the try.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yes. The Osiris-Rex spacecraft is currently surveying another carbon-rich asteroid known as Bennu, and it too will collect samples and return them to Earth <!-- -->(although it will not be making any craters on Bennu’s surface)<!-- -->. Bennu is even smaller than Ryugu, about 500 yards wide. Osiris-rex will not return with its samples until 2023. Early research results announced in March also revealed that Bennu is more rugged than expected, and that it is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/science/bennu-ryugu-asteroids.html?module=inline" title="">shooting rocks from its surface into space</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">NASA and Japanese scientists plan to exchange samples of the two asteroids to compare the similarities and differences.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the 2 in Hayabusa2 indicates, this is the second time that JAXA, the Japanese space agency, has sent a spacecraft to an asteroid.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hayabusa2 is an improved version of Hayabusa, which visited a stony asteroid, Itokawa, in 2005. Despite several technical problems at Itokawa, Hayabusa returned a capsule to Earth in 2010 containing 1,500 particles from the asteroid.</p>
