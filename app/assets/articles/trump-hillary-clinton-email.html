<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What about her emails?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Donald Trump raised that question like a red flag for three years, as candidate and president, casting doubts on how Hillary Clinton used a private email server to communicate with her staff and others while she was secretary of state.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her criminal conduct from public disclosure and exposure, knowing full well that her actions put our national security at risk,” Mr. Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/us/politics/jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-private-emails.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">said</a> late in the campaign.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Lock her up!” the crowds still chant at his rallies.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now a <!-- -->three-year<!-- --> State Department <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2019-10-17%20State%20Dept.%20to%20CEG%20-%20Classified%20Emails.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">investigation</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/politics/state-dept-inquiry-clinton-emails.html?module=inline" title="">has found</a> that, while about three dozen people violated <!-- -->protocols about classified material<!-- -->, they “did their best to implement them in their operations” and “there was no persuasive evidence of systemic, deliberate mishandling of classified information.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">[<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/reader-center/impeachment-editorial-board.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Read this explainer on the role of the Times editorial board.</em></a>]</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This comes after the F.B.I. determined months before the election that, while Mrs. Clinton was “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/us/politics/hillary-clinton-fbi-email-comey.html?module=inline" title="">extremely careless</a>” in having used a private email server for government communications, she did nothing illegal. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federal employees are supposed to conduct business on government networks to keep communications secure from foreign adversaries and to create a record of how the American government carried out its affairs. Those records let current officials (and also future historians) understand why actions were taken and make informed decisions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite Mr. Trump’s professed concern about the integrity of government communications, his administration doesn’t seem to take it too seriously. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, top White House advisers, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2019-03-21.EEC%20to%20Cipollone-WH.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">used</a> the messaging service WhatsApp for official — possibly classified — White House business, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/us/politics/jared-kushner-whatsapp.html?module=inline" title="">potentially violating federal records laws</a>, according to congressional investigators. For example, Mr. Kushner <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/17/politics/jared-kushner-saudi-ties-jamal-khashoggi/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">may have used it</a> to communicate with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, who the C.I.A. says ordered the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/us/politics/cia-saudi-crown-prince-khashoggi.html?module=inline" title="">murder</a> of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Both Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner also used private email accounts for official business, according to their lawyer. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They were not the only ones. Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, used a personal email account for some government business, her department’s inspector general <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/betsy-devos-used-personal-email-in-limited-circumstances-report-finds/2019/05/20/98fc9042-7b4f-11e9-8ede-f4abf521ef17_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">found</a>. White House officials <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/politics/private-email-trump-kushner-bannon.html?module=inline" title="">told</a> The Times in 2017 that Stephen Bannon, the former chief White House strategist; Reince Priebus, the former chief of staff; Gary D. Cohn, the former economic adviser; and Stephen Miller, a top aide, all had used personal email accounts for government business, as did <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/21/their-emails-seven-members-trumps-team-have-used-unofficial-communications-tools/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">K.T. McFarland</a>, the former deputy national security adviser.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The keeping and preservation of records isn’t just a matter of concern for historians, it is essential to the smooth functioning of the government. When government officials do business outside official channels, it not only hampers the business of governing, it also raises the concern that there is something to hide. A State Department investigation in 2016 found that other secretaries of state had handled classified information on unclassified email systems. While Mrs. Clinton’s name will always be associated with the practice, it is disappointing to see the use of personal email accounts proliferate across the government.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So the Trump administration’s widespread use of personal accounts for government work raises the unavoidable question: What about those emails? </p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
