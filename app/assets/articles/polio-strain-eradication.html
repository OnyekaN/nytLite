<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In another milestone on the long, expensive and sometimes discouraging road to wiping out polio, global health officials announced <!-- -->Wednesday<!-- --> that two of the three strains of wild polio virus have officially been eliminated.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although that brings the world another step closer to eradication, the effort has taken far longer than was ever anticipated. When the campaign began in 1988, most public health officials and donors expected the battle to be over by 2000.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But two major obstacles emerged.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">First, millions of families around the world have not let their children have the drops because of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/health/pakistan-vaccination-polio.html?module=inline" title="">persistent</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/20/world/asia/rumor-fear-and-fatigue-hinder-final-push-to-end-polio.html?module=inline" title="">false rumors</a> that the vaccine is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/20/world/middleeast/muslims-new-tack-on-polio-a-vaccine-en-route-to-mecca.html?module=inline" title="">a Western plot</a> to sterilize Muslim girls or do <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/health/pakistan-vaccination-polio.html?module=inline" title="">other harm</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Second, in some countries viruses used in the oral vaccine itself have mutated into a form that can be passed on in diapers and sewage, and can paralyze unvaccinated children. That has contributed to fear of the oral vaccine, even though full vaccination is the only protection against such mutant viruses.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Just in the last <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/24-september-2019-polio-outbreak-the-philippines/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">two months</a>, cases of paralysis caused by mutant vaccine viruses have been reported <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-10-21/massive-vaccine-campaign-underway-philippines-after-polios-return" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in the Philippines</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://outbreaknewstoday.com/polio-cases-reported-in-zambia-chad-and-togo-73820/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Zambia, Togo and Chad</a>. Because paralysis occurs in only about one in every 200 cases of polio, experts assume many more children have been infected. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stopping such outbreaks typically requires vaccinating hundreds of thousands of children with both the injectable vaccine, which contains killed virus that cannot mutate, and the oral vaccine. The latter contains weakened viruses that normally cannot cause disease but provide better protection than killed viruses.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The strain that the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://polioeradication.org/tools-and-library/policy-reports/certification-reports/global-certification-commission/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Global Certification Commission for the Eradication of Poliovirus</a> declared eliminated this week is Type 3 wild polio virus, the last case of which <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6345a4.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">was seen in Nigeria in 2012</a>. Type 2 was declared eliminated in 2015; the last case was detected in India in 1999.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Type 1, the only wild strain left, circulates only in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">(In the 1950s, the three strains had more evocative names: Brunhilde, Lansing and Leon. The first was named after a lab chimpanzee, the second after the Michigan city where it was isolated, and the third after a Los Angeles boy who died of it. <!-- -->The nicknames later fell out of favor<!-- -->.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Enormous, multiyear surveillance efforts are required before a viral strain can be declared extinct. Children can be paralyzed by several other viruses, by bacterial brain infections and by neck and spine injuries.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To ensure that polio was not the cause, stool samples must be taken from more than 100,000 paralyzed children every year. Thousands of sewage and water samples are drawn in 70 countries; the virus can be detected at parts-per-million concentrations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The certification commission has been very, very careful,” said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://vaccines.emory.edu/faculty-evc/primary-faculty/orenstein_walter.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Dr. Walter A. Orenstein</a>, a polio expert at Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta and former immunization director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the last decade, a dangerous new front has opened in the war on polio. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In countries where vaccination rates are low, the weakened viruses in the oral vaccine can circulate in wastewater and mutate into what are effectively evil twins of themselves. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By piling up random <!-- -->genetic<!-- --> changes, or by swapping genes with other intestinal viruses like Coxsackie virus, viruses can become virulent again and paralyze children who have never been vaccinated.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the last two years, outbreaks of cVDPV — which stands for “circulating vaccine-derived polio virus” — have struck nearly 20 countries. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although most of those outbreaks have been small and eventually were contained, more children are now paralyzed by cVDPV each year than by Type 1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For example, <!-- -->thus far<!-- --> this year,<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> 88 Pakistani and Afghani children have been paralyzed by the last wild strain, while 95 children in Africa and Asia have been paralyzed by</a> vaccine-derived viruses.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To prevent that, the eradication campaign is taking several steps. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">First, health officials are trying to see that every child in the world gets at least one dose of the injected vaccine. It circulates in the blood, so a child can still get — and spread — a gut infection but won’t be paralyzed by it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Second, a year after Type 2 polio was eliminated worldwide, the campaign rolled out a new “bivalent” vaccine lacking the Type 2 <!-- -->weakened<!-- --> virus.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there will be no “monovalent” vaccine with only Type 1 weakened virus, said <!-- -->Michel Zaffran<!-- -->, director of polio eradication at the World Health Organization.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The Type 2 was so powerful that it dominated the old vaccine,” he said. “Removing Type 3 will not make the current one more immunogenic.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a bureaucratic nightmare, he added, to get every country in the world to import and refrigerate hundreds of millions of new vaccine doses and safely destroy their old ones.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t need to create a new problem,” <!-- -->Dr.<!-- --> Zaffran said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Third, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is supporting the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://theconversation.com/a-newly-designed-vaccine-may-help-stamp-out-remaining-polio-cases-worldwide-121598" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">creation of new oral vaccines</a> less able to mutate into dangerous forms.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Tightening the loose ends” by cutting some <!-- -->nucleotides<!-- --> out of the part of the genome that acts as a gatekeeper leaves it less likely to swap genes with other gut viruses, said <!-- -->Dr.<!-- --> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2019/03/27/ananda-bandyopadhyay-why-indias-triumph-against-polio-sets-the-stage-for-global-polio-eradication/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Ananda S.
