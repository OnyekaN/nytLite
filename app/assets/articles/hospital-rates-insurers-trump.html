<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Trump administration on Monday said it would begin forcing hospitals to publicly disclose the discounted prices they negotiate with insurance companies, a requirement intended to help patients shop for better deals on a range of medical services, from hip replacements to CT scans. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The plan, issued as a proposed federal rule, would take effect in January, but would likely be challenged in court by an industry that has long held such rates secret. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The reality is in every other part of our economy you can get pricing information, but somehow in health care, which is arguably some of the most dollars that we spend, you can’t,” said <!-- -->Seema Verma<!-- -->, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, announcing the proposed rule. “We’re trying to change the paradigm.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Administration officials and others have criticized hospitals and insurers for keeping the deals they strike a secret, making it impossible for patients to seek less expensive places to get care. They argue that by making public the actual prices that insurers pay — and not just the standard list prices for various services, which the Trump administration <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/hospital-prices-online.html?module=inline" title="">started requiring hospitals to post earlier this year</a> — hospitals will be under more pressure to compete. Over time, prices will drop, Ms. Verma predicted.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After failing to carry out the long-held Republican Party goal of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, the Trump administration has made medical and drug prices a focus of its health policy. Monday’s announcement is part of a broader program to make information about health care pricing and quality more readily available to patients, and it fleshes out <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/upshot/health-care-price-transparency-trump.amp.html?module=inline" title="">President Trump’s executive order from last month</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But some economists argue that posting negotiated prices is meaningless because it does not tell patients their actual out-of-pocket costs. Patients with insurance don’t pay the full price of a procedure; how much they owe depends on the deductible and co-payments in their health plan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pricing information also does little to help patients determine the quality of an individual doctor or hospital. “This is not the information that patients want or need,” said Tom Nickels, an executive vice president at the American Hospital Association.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The proposal, if implemented, has the potential to rock the health care industry, which critics argue thrives on the secrecy of the negotiations between hospitals and insurers. Both groups have objected to making public what they consider proprietary information, and they are expected to mount legal challenges to any mandated disclosure. In Ohio, a state law requiring price transparency that was passed two years ago is still mired in the courts.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Both the hospitals and insurers argue that disclosing prices would lead to higher costs, not lower ones, because each institution would know the prices of its competitors and could be reluctant to settle for less.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Publicly disclosing competitively negotiated, proprietary rates will push prices and premiums higher — not lower — for consumers, patients and taxpayers,” said <!-- -->Matt Eyles<!-- -->, the chief executive of America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, in a statement.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Verma said requiring hospitals to post negotiated prices on the internet, in a searchable format, is becoming more important as many Americans’ health insurance deductibles — the amount they have to spend on medical care before their coverage kicks in — steadily grow. She acknowledged, however, that the prices would not help people understand how much they would personally owe.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked what legal authority the administration had to require hospitals to post negotiated rates, Ms. Verma cited a provision of the Affordable Care Act — a law that the Trump administration <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/us/politics/obamacare-unconstitutional-trump-aca.html?module=inline" title="">is supporting efforts to overturn</a> in court — that requires hospitals to make public a list of standard charges.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another attempt by the Trump administration to create transparency in health care prices — a requirement that pharmaceutical companies disclose the list price of their drugs in their television ads — has been put on hold by the courts. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/health/drug-prices-tv-ads-trump.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fkatie-thomas&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=6&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">A federal judge ruled earlier this month</a> that the Department of Health and Human Services exceeded its regulatory authority with the rule, which was seen as largely symbolic since list prices are not what patients typically pay.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p>
