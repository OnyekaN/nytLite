<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In March 2017, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/obituaries/karl-lagerfeld-dead.html?module=inline" title="">Karl Lagerfeld</a>, perhaps the greatest master of the viral social media moment a fashion show had ever seen, docked <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/fashion/paris-fashion-week-chanel-alexander-mcqueen.html?module=inline" title="">a rocket ship</a> under the glass dome of the Grand Palais in Paris for his Chanel show — and then made sure, as the models strutted around it in astronaut-print frocks, that it had actual blastoff.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That was a few weeks after Nick Graham, the former chief underpants officer of Joe Boxer, held a<!-- --> show<!-- --> at New York Fashion Week: Men’s, for his namesake line. The show was entitled “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/fashion/astral-fashion-buzz-aldrin-space.html?module=inline" title="">Mission to Mars</a>,” and it featured Buzz Aldrin, the lunar module pilot on the Apollo 11 mission, as its closing model. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">that</em> was just over a year before Heron Preston teamed up with NASA to create a line of streetwear splashed with the space agency’s logo, which was itself around the time Virgil Abloh closed his first<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/fashion/louis-vuitton-virgil-abloh-paris.html?module=inline" title=""> Louis Vuitton</a> men’s wear collection with a model in a silver space poncho.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I always say, space is the new black,” said Mr. Graham, who on Tuesday sponsored the annual Kennedy Space Center gala, a blowout in honor of the moon landing that included a Swarovski-crystal-covered mini-rocket ship award for the best dressed in space-inspired clothing. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In honor of the event Mr. Graham also made a limited-edition NASA bomber jacket in silver or black satin with a lining featuring the Saturn 5 rocket.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Just over half a century ago, the space age caught the imagination of the fashion world and changed how we all dress, ushering in an era of liquid mercury frocks and go-go boots; of synthetic fabrics and plastic fantastic technological innovation. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The influence of the intergalactic has waxed and waned over the years, but when it comes to wardrobes, the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing — not to mention President Trump’s plans for a new <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-space-force.html?module=inline" title="">Space Force</a>; the imminent release of “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” the finale of the space saga; the news that NASA plans to open the International Space Center to tourists next year; and the Elon Musk-Jeff Bezos-Richard Branson race to privatize exploration of the cosmos — is bound to set off trends once again. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This time, however, is not quite like the last time.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Space travel is glamorous, it’s modern, and it’s exclusive,” said Mia Fineman, <!-- -->a curator<!-- --> in the department of photography of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the exhibition curator of “Apollo’s Muse: The Moon in the Age of Photography” — all words with great appeal to designers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Julien Dossena, the creative director of Paco Rabanne, said: “It carries values of excitement and belief in human kind and progress. And that never really goes out of fashion.” It does, however, change.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Originally, after all, the space set — André Courrèges, Pierre Cardin and Paco Rabanne (whose penchant for unnatural materials like plastic and metal, and the links therein, inspired Jane Fonda’s futuristic sex bomb costumes in “Barbarella”) — were united by a sense of optimism and belief in the new frontier, as represented by their clothing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“For French designers especially, the space age became a metaphor for youth and progress,” said Valerie Steele, the director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">White and silver, shine, movement, geometric shapes (especially if they mimicked flying saucers and planetoids), the Milky Way, interstellar imagery: These were the building blocks of a generational new look.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“When you look back at that time, it was almost magical for people,” Mr. Dossena said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But what happens when you look forward?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As our own attitudes toward space exploration have evolved — have stretched toward Mars; toward the galaxy as a necessary escape, rather than pioneer jaunt; toward the idea of mining other planets in an effort to repair the damage done this one — so, too, have the designs of those whose job it is to interpret what the promise of space means today. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After all, to simply look back is to engage in an exercise in kitsch nostalgia, the exact opposite of what the original space age designers were doing. There’s a reason the new motto of Courrèges is “the future is behind you.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And a reason <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/fashion/courreges-paris-fashion-week.html?module=inline" title="">Yolanda Zobel</a>, the artistic director of the brand, has made it her mission to replace the house’s signature vinyl, which once upon a time represented a breakthrough, with natural materials.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The question of the future is the central question,” Ms. Zobel said. “You still think about a new world, but today that means something different. It’s maybe how we do the same thing, but without plastic this time.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to Lucie Greene, <!-- -->a trend forecaster<!-- -->, advances in material science as much as any silhouette, is actually what represents fashion’s new frontier, with designers orbiting around the ideas of growing leather from mushrooms, extruding fabric from a 3-D printer, and regulating body temperature — in a time of climate change — through sensors in fabric.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Now we see the evolution of mankind in a more careful way because we realize what it has meant for the planet,” Mr. Dossena said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Indeed, there is a notably dystopian tinge to the recent wave of space fashion, a somewhat unnerving reflection of where, exactly, all that futurism took us.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The emphasis now is on apocalyptic clothing, and protective garments,” Ms. Greene said, pointing to the proliferation of Mylar blankets, jumpsuits, cover-ups, balaclavas and armor in stores. It’s what to wear when the comet shower comes or you have to survive in an atmosphere not necessarily hospitable to humanity.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The implication being: “We messed up planet Earth, so we have to go explore other planets,” Ms. Fineman said. This time, we’re on the dark side of the moon.</p>
