<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last week, Michael L. Johnson, <!-- -->a former college wrestler convicted of failing to disclose to sexual partners<!-- --> <!-- -->that he was H.I.V. positive<!-- --> in a racially charged case<!-- --> that reignited calls to <!-- --> re-examine laws that criminalize H.I.V. exposure, walked out of the Boonville Correctional <!-- -->Center<!-- --> in Missouri 25 years earlier than expected.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Johnson, 27, was released on parole on Tuesday after an appeals court found that his 2015 trial was “fundamentally unfair.” His original sentence was longer than the state average for second-degree murder.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Reached by phone two days after his release, Mr. Johnson said he was rediscovering freedom through convenience store snacks, cartoons and his cellphone.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m feeling really, really good,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there were periods when he felt intimidated by people who did not believe he had a right to stand up for himself, he added.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His case, which encompasses a half-dozen years of court appearances, unflattering headlines and stints in solitary confinement, has galvanized advocates working to update laws that they say further stigmatize and unfairly penalize people with H.I.V.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Johnson, who was a black, gay athlete <!-- -->at Lindenwood University in St. Charles<!-- -->, Mo., has become a public face of <!-- -->people who are disproportionately affected by <!-- -->the virus and <!-- -->entangled in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/prosecutor-race-blind-charging.html?module=inline" title="">the </a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/prosecutor-race-blind-charging.html?module=inline" title="">criminal justice system</a>. (If current trends continue, about half of all black men who have sex with men in the United States will eventually learn they have H.I.V., <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2016/croi-press-release-risk.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Johnson’s legal troubles began in 2013, when he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/steventhrasher/how-college-wrestling-star-tiger-mandingo-became-an-hiv-scap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">was arrested</a> after a <!-- -->white man<!-- --> he had had consensual sex with<!-- --> <!-- -->told the police he believed that Mr. Johnson had given him the virus.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Five other men, <!-- -->three of them white<!-- -->, would later testify that Mr. Johnson had not only failed to disclose his H.I.V. status before engaging in consensual sex, but had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2582033-police-report-andrew-tryon.html#document/p5/a263307" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">willfully lied about it</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Johnson <!-- -->has publicly maintained<!-- --> that <!-- -->he informed all six men he was H.I.V. positive before having sex<!-- --> without a condom.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a weeklong trial in 2015 in St. Charles County, a conservative, predominantly white area northwest of St. Louis, <!-- --> Mr. Johnson <!-- -->was convicted on <!-- -->multiple felony counts<!-- -->, including recklessly infecting another with H.I.V.<!-- -->, which carries a 10-year minimum sentence.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The jury sought the maximum penalty of <!-- -->60½<!-- --> years even though prosecutors offered no genetic evidence that Mr. Johnson had infected any of his partners, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/steventhrasher/a-black-body-on-trial-the-conviction-of-hiv-positive-tiger-m" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to BuzzFeed News</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The judge ultimately sentenced him to 30 years in prison.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today, <!-- -->some of the people<!-- --> who put him in prison say the sentencing and parts of the prosecution were mishandled.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’re still operating under laws that were based on views that are outdated and are proven inaccurate by science,” said Tim Lohmar, the St. Charles County prosecuting attorney, whose office’s handling of the trial <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/reckless-prosecution-tiger-mandingo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">has been criticized</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Missouri<!-- --> is one of about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.hivlawandpolicy.org/sites/default/files/CHLP%20HIV%20Crim%20Map%20030119.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">34 states with laws</a> <!-- -->that make it a crime to expose another person to the virus without disclosure or add additional penalties for people with H.I.V. who are convicted of separate offenses, such as sex work, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.hivlawandpolicy.org/sourcebook" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to the nonprofit Center for H.I.V. Law and Policy</a>. In six states, a person may be required to register as a sex offender if convicted of an H.I.V.-related crime.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many of these laws were written in the 1980s and 1990s under a fog of fear about the virus and how it was transmitted, and before the advent of effective treatments. <!-- -->In those years<!-- -->, Magic Johnson’s sweat on the basketball court and Greg Louganis’s blood on a diving board panicked fans and teammates. Parents pulled children from school in 1985 because <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://hab.hrsa.gov/about-ryan-white-hivaids-program/who-was-ryan-white" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">an H.I.V.-positive boy with hemophilia</a> was in their seventh-grade class.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Back then, an H.I.V. diagnosis meant debilitating symptoms and almost certain death.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the last five years, Steven Thrasher, a journalism professor at Northwestern University, has chronicled Michael L. Johnson’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/steventhrasher/a-black-body-on-trial-the-conviction-of-hiv-positive-tiger-m" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">case for BuzzFeed News</a> and recently completed his doctoral dissertation on race and H.I.V. criminalization.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Thrasher, who greeted Mr. Johnson outside the correctional facility on Tuesday, said he was first drawn to the case because of its parallels with the history of black sexuality and lynching.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Black men would just get lynched anytime they had sex with white women in the Reconstruction period,” he said. “There was no consensual sex that could be had between white women and black men.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Johnson’s wrestler’s body — he called himself “Tiger Mandingo” online — was a source of fascination for some of his partners. But when Mr. Johnson tested positive for H.I.V., Dr. Thrasher wrote, he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/steventhrasher/how-college-wrestling-star-tiger-mandingo-became-an-hiv-scap" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">became “the perfect scapegoat.”</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was not that he had no <!-- -->agency or responsibility<!-- --> in the story,” Dr. Thrasher said on Thursday, but “he was really holding all of this anxiety and all of this worry about AIDS and stigma and H.I.V. and queerness in America all on his shoulders.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Lohmar, the St. Charles County prosecutor, said on Thursday that “nothing about the trial was unfair,” except for<!-- --> his team’s failure <!-- --> to present certain evidence to the defense in time.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because prosecutors did not disclose <!-- -->some<!-- --> evidence to the defense until the morning of the trial — recorded phone conversations Mr. Johnson made while in the county jail — an appeals court decided to <!-- -->overturn the conviction<!-- --> 17 months <!-- -->after the original sentencing. <!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Instead of a new trial, Mr. Johnson, who previously had a clean criminal record, accepted a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/alford_plea" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">plea deal</a> in which he did not admit guilt but agreed to a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/steventhrasher/tiger-mandingo-takes-plea-deal-for-knowingly-transmitting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">10-year sentence</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Eric M. Selig, the lawyer who negotiated on Mr. Johnson’s behalf, said the original sentence was disproportionate to the crime.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t charge people with other incurable diseases, like hepatitis, with a criminal offense for exposing others,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During his incarceration, Mr. Johnson wrote thank-you notes to friends and strangers who had written to him in support, which he said helped him deal with homophobia in prison and self-doubt.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You lose your confidence,” he said. “I kept every single letter.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In theory, H.I.V. exposure laws are meant to encourage H.I.V.-positive individuals to disclose their status before having sex, and to practice safer sex, with the ultimate goal of preventing the spread of the virus. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there is no evidence that these laws have reduced risky behavior or encouraged disclosure, said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hivlawandpolicy.org/about/team" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Catherine Hanssens</a>, the executive director of the Center for H.I.V. Law and Policy, which provided legal support for Mr. Johnson’s case.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the eyes of the law, an H.I.V. diagnosis is conflated with malice, she added.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“These laws effectively treat an H.I.V. diagnosis itself as evidence that the person acted with bad intentions when sex or other types of physical contact are involved in a crime,” she said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Additionally, many laws do not reflect recent treatment options that can give patients a life expectancy almost as long as the general population. A pill taken daily can almost eliminate transmission, experts say. But there remain large barriers to eradicating the virus, including the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/health/trump-hiv-aids-costs.html?module=inline" title="">high cost of antiretroviral drugs</a>, access issues, medical mistrust and other social barriers in poor and black communities.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While some states, like California, have reduced penalties for H.I.V. exposure, Missouri has one of the most punitive laws in the country. This year lawmakers introduced two bills into the Legislature that would have slightly reduced the penalty, but they never made it to a vote.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Lohmar said he learned of Mr. Johnson’s release after receiving a call from one of the witnesses in the trial, who was upset that he was not notified.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Johnson said he planned to return to college, learn a second language and share his story through advocacy organizations like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://hab.hrsa.gov/about-ryan-white-hivaids-program/about-ryan-white-hivaids-program" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the Ryan White Planning Council in Indiana</a>. Younger people especially need to learn about the virus to prevent it from spreading, he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You can’t do it without education.”</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Alain Delaquérière contributed research.</p>
