<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The wonder of the Trump administration — the jaw-dropping, brain-exploding phantasmagoria of it — is that it doesn’t bury its rottenness under layers of counterfeit virtue or use a honeyed voice to mask the vinegar inside. The rottenness is out in the open. The sourness is right there on the surface for all to see.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s at the president’s rallies, where he plays a bigot for laughs, a bully for applause.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s in the ballrooms and beds at Mar-a-Loco, where he mingles official government business with free marketing for his gilded club.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s in the transcript of his phone call with the president of Ukraine, for whom the quid, the pro and the Biden-ravaging quo couldn’t have been clearer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s at the microphone in the White House briefing room, where his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, showed up on Thursday, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-has-awarded-next-years-g-7-summit-of-world-leaders-to-his-miami-area-resort-the-white-house-said/2019/10/17/221b32d6-ef52-11e9-89eb-ec56cd414732_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">announced </a>that President Trump would host the next G7 meeting at one of his own golf resorts, and conceded that, yes, aid to Ukraine had been tied to that country’s indulgence of the president’s political obsessions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Get over it,” Mulvaney told the assembled journalists.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Elections have consequences,” he also said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Allow me to translate: American voters gave Trump the presidency, so it’s his to use and abuse as he wants. If you’re looking for an apology, you might as well be looking for the yeti. What you should really be doing is looking the other way.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/mick-mulvaney-trump-ukraine.html?module=inline" title="">Mere hours later,</a> Mulvaney changed his tune, whining that the media had “decided to misconstrue” his words as some kind of confession. Um, no. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Our hearing was just fine, our construing was just right and our sole arguable failure was that <!-- -->we didn’t instantly grasp and immediately communicate the overarching import of his remarks<!-- -->: He was telling us that in the minds of the president and his unscrupulous minions, he from now on possessed and planned to revel in carte blanche. And the White House has a new public relations strategy, much evolved since the days of Robert Mueller.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those revelations of rottenness that I mentioned before? They’re no longer an inadvertent tic. They’re an advertent tactic. Done with denials of wrongdoing, administration officials are reframing it as right-doing — as a president’s prerogative, even his entitlement, pre-emptively authorized by voters themselves.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Get over it, media. Get over it, America. This is Trump’s country. You’re just squatting in it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Get a more personal take on politics, newsmakers and more with Frank Bruni’s exclusive commentary every week. </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/frank-bruni?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up for his newsletter.</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump’s presidency was scary from the very start, when he summoned “American carnage” and hallucinated inauguration throngs. But the past several days have been something else: a clarifying, terrifying descent.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">How low will Trump go? Leagues lower than you ever imagined, and probably several hundred feet below your current nightmares. Officials <!-- -->with <!-- -->Trump’s re-election campaign apparently plan to use “get over it” as a slogan on merchandise, but I think that the White House’s real new motto comes from Tacitus, a celebrated historian in ancient Rome: “Crime, once exposed, has no refuge but in audacity.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That audacity animated Mulvaney. It was manifest when Trump publicly beseeched China to get in on the action and do its own investigation of Hunter and Joe Biden. It helps explain the decision — which, under intense pressure, he reversed on Saturday — to convene the G7 at Trump National Doral Miami, a gesture of such perverse defiance, such profound contempt, that it takes the breath away.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the gaslighting logic that is his greatest gift, Trump is asserting that no real crook would be this nakedly, flamboyantly criminal, and he’s giving anyone in America who isn’t aboard the Trump train the middle finger. It, not his brain, is the body part with which he governs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is all about impeachment, to which he has responded — predictably — with a puerile rage. The first, second and third laws of Trumpian psychology are that for every action, there’s an unequal and hysterical overreaction, and ever since impeachment took on an air of probability, he has been overreacting all over the place.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He’s at his most dangerous when he’s most vulnerable and impotent, because he’s compelled to project command and potency. He has to convince everyone that he’s unflustered and unafraid.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That, as much as any promise to voters, motivated the disastrous pullout from Syria and abandonment of Kurdish allies. Precisely <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">because </em>it was what might undermine the loyalty of his Republican saviors and leave him exposed, he did it. It was a pantomime of fearlessness, a pretense of invincibility.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ditto the Doral decision, which Mulvaney, saying goodbye to any shreds of credibility and integrity that he was still clinging to, insisted would not turn much if any profit for Trump. Whatever the actual revenues from the G7 meeting itself, it would have amounted to the kind of advertising that money can’t buy. Doral would have been better known afterward, just as Mar-a-Loco, Bedminster and other Trump properties have skyrocketed in visibility since he took office. He has made sure of it, by visiting them in a constant rotation that repurposes the presidency as a promotional tool and branding exercise.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The G7 at Doral was just the cherry on a rancid sundae. But the timing of it: That’s what was so chilling. It came as the sword dangled ever sharper and more threatening over his head, and it made clear that he won’t be answering the accelerating revelations about him<!-- --> with good behavior that coaxes Americans to wonder if he could really have been that bad.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">No, he’ll ratchet up the badness, intensify the insolence and lash out more provocatively and ruinously than ever before. He’ll be <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">worse. </em>Virtue is for suckers, who don’t have the nerve for vice. Look, Ma, no morals!</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The miserable Mikes, Pence and Pompeo, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/syria-ceasefire-trump-administration-deal-turkey-president-erdogan-today-after-meeting-pompeo-pence-2019-10-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">will race around the world</a> trying to forestall or clean up his messes, because “get over it” doesn’t really translate to geopolitics, where the “it” can be terrorism, slaughter and an American image soiled beyond repair.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ivanka and Jared Kushner will lay low, as they’re doing now, unable to peddle the pretty fiction that they’re keeping a lid on the combustible patriarch, who keeps setting himself on fire.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He has finally arrived on the Fifth Avenue that he conjured long ago.
