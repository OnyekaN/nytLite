<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In early May, a United Nations panel on biodiversity released a deeply troubling 1,500-page <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/05/nature-decline-unprecedented-report/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">report</a> warning that as many as one million plant and animal species were at risk of extinction worldwide. It strongly urged nations everywhere to accelerate efforts to save the marine and terrestrial life that remain — the mammals, the birds, the fish, the plants, even the insects that pollinate the world’s food supply. The report also noted that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/climate?module=inline" title="">global warming</a> had become a major driver of this alarming decline, shrinking or shifting the ecosystems in which wildlife had evolved.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now comes what amounts to a thumb in the eye from the Trump administration: The Interior Department <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/climate/endangered-species-act-changes.html?module=inline" title="">announced a set of rules</a> on Monday that, far from enlarging protections, will <!-- -->weaken how the nation’s most important conservation law<!-- -->, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/subject/endangered-and-extinct-species?module=inline" title="">Endangered Species Act</a>, is applied. The proposed changes would make it harder to shield fragile species not only from commercial development like logging and oil and gas drilling, but also from the multiple threats posed by climate change. Specifically, the rules would complicate the task of getting species listed as <!-- -->threatened<!-- --> or endangered in the first place, and would reduce the habitat judged necessary for their survival. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These changes should come as no surprise to anyone who has paid the least bit of attention to this administration’s environmental and energy policies over the past two years. They are fully consistent with a broader <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html?module=inline" title="">pattern of regulatory moves</a> aimed at reducing costs and burdens on business. They are in keeping as well with a host of other actions supporting President Trump’s policy of “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/climate/trump-energy-dominance.html?module=inline" title="">energy dominance</a>,” including but not limited to a pell-mell rush to open the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/us/oil-drilling-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge.html?module=inline" title="">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a> to oil exploration, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/climate/bears-ears-national-monument.html?module=inline" title="">evisceration of two national monuments in Utah</a> to make way for drilling and mining, and clawing back nine million acres in several oil-rich Western states that the Obama administration had set aside to protect <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/climate/trump-sage-grouse.html?module=inline" title="">the imperiled sage grouse. </a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The announcement of the new rules was accompanied by predictably pious boilerplate from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/endangered-species-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">David Bernhardt</a>, the interior secretary and a former oil lobbyist, to the effect that the changes were necessary to modernize and simplify the law and make it more transparent. Neither he nor the dozen or so Republicans from Western states recruited to sing his praises mentioned anywhere in their public statements the act’s popularity with the general public and its rich bipartisan pedigree. Strongly endorsed by President Richard Nixon, and approved by huge margins in both chambers of Congress (the House vote was an astounding <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/support-for-the-endangered-species-act-remains-high-as-trump-administration-and-congress-try-to-gut-it" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">355 to 4</a>), the act would stand zero chance of passage in today’s poisoned political climate. The moderate Republicans who thrived in Congress in Nixon’s day are themselves an endangered species, if not, for all practical purposes, extinct. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nor was there any mention of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/esa_wild_success/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the act’s striking successes</a>, the species brought back from the edge, including, among other creatures small and great, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/climate/endangered-species-act-changes.html?module=inline" title="">bald eagle</a>, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fws.gov/chesapeakebay/peregr.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">peregrine falcon</a>, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/animalia/wp/2016/06/17/we-saved-the-alligators-from-extinction-then-moved-into-their-territory/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">American alligator</a> and the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/science/gray-wolf-protection.html?module=inline" title="">gray wolf</a>. Instead, we heard the tired and irrelevant complaint that, of the more than 1,650 species listed as threatened or endangered, only 47 have been delisted because their populations have rebounded to fully sustainable levels. But that’s a nutty way of measuring success; species once hurtling toward extinction can hardly be expected to rebuild healthy populations overnight. And only a relative handful have actually gone to their doom, while many are deemed stable and on the road to recovery. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are several shortcomings to the Trump administration’s new rules, but two stand out. The first would allow regulators for the first time to calculate economic costs when deciding whether a species warrants protection — for instance, estimating lost revenue from logging operations prohibited in habitat set aside for species. Under current law, listing decisions must be made solely on the basis of science “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/8/12/20802132/endangered-species-act-trump-weakening" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">without reference to possible economic or other impacts</a>.” An <!-- -->administration official<!-- --> insisted that future listings would still be based solely on science and that economic studies would be for informational purposes only.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But let’s not be naïve. First, there’s the mind-set of senior officials; from Day 1, this administration has shown disregard bordering on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/27/us/politics/trump-climate-science.html?module=inline" title="">contempt for science</a> when making important decisions about the environment. Economic information could covertly influence regulators who are already suspicious of science, from Mr. Bernhardt on down, and really didn't much like the Endangered Species Act to begin with. It could also be used to tilt public opinion against a controversial listing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The second major shortcoming in the new rules is their failure to squarely confront the problem of climate change. Indeed, the rule makers appear to have gone to some lengths to dodge the problem. The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/glossary/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">law defines two categories</a> of at-risk species — threatened and endangered. Currently, a threatened species is one “likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.<!-- -->”<!-- --> “Foreseeable future” is not defined. The new rules do so, in some detail and in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/publications/earthonline/endangered-earth-online-no997.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ways that critics believe</a> will invite the government to discount the future effects of global warming. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under the new rules, “foreseeable future” extends only as far as officials can “reasonably determine” that the future threats are “likely.” This leaves substantial room to dismiss the far-off threats of climate change as excessively speculative. It might have made it difficult, for instance, <!-- -->back in 20<!-- -->08, to designate the polar bear as a threatened species and, two years later, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/science/earth/23bear.html?module=inline" title="">set aside more than 187,000 square miles</a> of sea ice and barrier islands in Alaska as critical habit and thus off limits to development. At the time, officials relied on climate models that extended many decades into the future, which under the new rules might not have been acceptable. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The ability of species to adapt to global warming could be further undermined by new language addressing critical habitat, the land that can be kept off limits to development to help species recover. Current rules define critical habitat as not only the land where the threatened or endangered species live but also the land they once occupied and land they might need in the future. As the world warms, species will move, their ranges will shift and that unoccupied land could become important to their survival. But that land gets short shrift in the new rules, and it could now be opened for mining, timbering, oil drilling or other forms of exploitation. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For all of Mr. Bernhardt’s talk of transparency and efficiency, some of the new rules seemed deliberately designed to throw sand in the machinery (which may, of course, be the whole point). Under present practice, known as the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/factsheets/ESA%20SpecialRules%20Factsheet_020714.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“blanket section 4(d) rule,”</a> the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which administers the law, automatically extends many of the same protections to threatened species as it does to endangered ones. The point of the act is to keep species from becoming endangered or, even worse, blinking out. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This rule is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fws.gov/endangered/improving_ESA/regulation-revisions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">now history</a>, replaced by a system in which the agency will, case by case, develop species-specific protection plans. This could be a cumbersome and time-consuming task, of little benefit to the species awaiting help. Mr. Bernhardt’s team has already slowed the listing process. The Obama administration added <!-- -->an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/reports/species-listings-count-by-year-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">average</a> of 49 species a year<!-- --> to the threatened and endangered lists. <!-- -->The Trump administration has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-eases-endangered-species-act-protections-11565625902" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">added no more than 11 in one year</a>. In 2019, it has added only the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fws.gov/southeast/wildlife/fishes/trispot-darter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">trispot darter,</a> a type of fish from the Southeast listed as threatened in late January. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like other Trump environmental rule changes and rollbacks, this one will undoubtedly face challenges. Environmentally inclined senators have been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/climate/endangered-species-act-changes.html?module=inline" title="">talking about invoking congressional oversight procedures</a> to overturn the rules, which is possible if they move quickly enough, but unlikely. The best hope lies with the courts, which in several cases — notably <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/climate/trump-oil-drilling-arctic.html?module=inline" title="">Mr. Trump’s efforts to roll back Obama-era protections against drilling in Arctic waters</a> — have not been at all reluctant to slam on the brakes, and in general have been a bulwark against Trumpian overreach. The California attorney general, Xavier Becerra, and his Massachusetts counterpart, Maura Healey, citing findings from the alarming United Nations extinctions study in May, have said they will <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kusi.com/states-promise-lawsuits-over-changes-to-endangered-species-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">take the administration to court</a> for what they believe are multiple violations of the law’s basic purpose. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We hope they, and the environmental groups that join them, will persist. Ms. Healey likens the new rules to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/white-house-rolls-out-plan-to-weaken-endangered-species-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“a plan from a cartoon villain,”</a> ignoring everything we know about biodiversity, its uses and its alarming decline in pursuit of Mr. Trump’s reckless energy agenda. At issue is the full expression of one of the country’s noblest and most ambitious environmental laws. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
