<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The global drive to eliminate polio, which has gone on for 31 years and consumed over $16 billion, has been set back again by a surge of new cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As of July 10, there were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a total of 42 polio paralysis cases in the two countries</a>. They comprise <!-- -->a single large outbreak<!-- -->, because most cases are in the tribal areas along the border, where local people easily cross back and forth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pakistan had 32 of the cases, compared to only three by the same date last year, and the situation is expected to get worse because hot summer weather favors the virus. There were only 12 cases in the country in 2018 and eight in 2017.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For each paralyzed victim — usually a child below age 5 — there are about 200 others who are infected and shedding the virus in their stool, the World Health Organization estimates.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About 20,000 children are born each day in Pakistan. In cities with open sewers, and where <!-- -->other pathogens <!-- -->may attach to the same intestinal receptors that the vaccine does, it can take many doses to fully immunize a child. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last year’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/world/asia/pakistan-election-imran-khan.html?module=inline" title="">hotly contested national elections</a> temporarily threw the program off track as local officials were replaced, said Aziz Memon, head of Rotary International’s polio campaign in Pakistan. Cases have typically spiked during elections and moments of political turmoil, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://thediplomat.com/2019/06/pakistan-and-the-politics-of-polio/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">an article in The Diplomat</a>, a current affairs magazine focused on Asia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Earlier this year, Pakistan announced that it <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/health/pakistan-vaccination-polio.html?module=inline" title="">would streamline its national vaccination drive in June</a> in order to make the campaigns faster and less intrusive. Teams would try a friendlier approach and gather less data on the families they visited, the prime minister’s office said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But false rumors spread on social media saying the vaccine had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/IftikharFirdous/status/1120372934487564290" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">triggered fainting spells</a> — or even that it had killed dozens of children — and many families locked their doors to vaccinators or hid their children.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The issue has split families; The Times of London recently described a Pakistani man returning from work and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/husband-divorces-wife-for-vaccinating-their-family-against-polio-svtxz9kft" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">divorcing his wife on the spot</a> after finding their children’s fingers marked with the indelible ink used by polio vaccinators. Islamic law allows a man to end a marriage by merely saying “I divorce you” three times; he threw his wife and children out of the house. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As in other countries, like Italy, vaccines have become politicized, with opposition parties spreading anti-vaccine rumors. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Babar bin Atta, the prime minister’s special assistant for polio eradication, said in a letter to the Dawn newspaper that population movements and increasing numbers of refusals were hurting the effort.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The country, he said, would try to fix continuing problems with routine immunization, safe water and sanitation, and the high incidence of malnutrition.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Eradicating polio from Pakistan “may take longer than we hoped for," he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virus is threatening to spread to other countries. In May, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/csr/don/24-may-2019-wild-polio-virus-islamic-republic-of-iran/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a sewage sample in a bordering province in Iran tested positive</a> for the strain of virus circulating in Pakistan; Iran had its last case of polio paralysis in 2001.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A further threat to the eradication campaign is that a few countries — mostly in Africa — have been unable to eliminate some mutated strains of the polio viruses used in live vaccines. Those strains have reverted back into forms capable of causing paralysis. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the last two years, there have been outbreaks of “vaccine-derived polio” in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea and Somalia. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last week<!-- -->, a sewage sample in western China <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">tested positive for a vaccine-derived polio strain</a>, meaning the virus must be circulating there although no cases of paralysis caused by it have yet been detected.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Xinjiang, the province where it was found, borders on both Pakistan and Afghanistan. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Historically, such outbreaks have always been eliminated by the use of injectable killed vaccines, which cannot mutate, and live vaccines that protect against the mutated strains. But the outbreaks in some countries have gone on for many months. </p>
