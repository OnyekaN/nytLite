<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BAGHDAD — As a boy, Hamza bin Laden appeared in propaganda films for Al Qaeda, the terrorist group led by his father, Osama. He preached jihad, trained with fighters and was introduced as a voice of Al Qaeda, “a young lion to carry forth the cause.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But much of his story remains shrouded in mystery. And when American officials announced on Wednesday that the younger Mr. bin Laden <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/hamza-bin-laden-al-qaeda.html?module=inline" title="">had been killed in a United States strike</a> in the past two years, details about where and how he died were as scarce as information about his life in the shadows.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was believed to have been about 30 years old.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. bin Laden had been mistakenly pronounced dead before, when officials thought he had died in the SEAL raid to kill his father. Two years ago, there was also a failed attempt to kill him, according to three officials.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/thomasjoscelyn/status/1156763409276387329" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">noted on Twitter on Thursday</a> that Al Qaeda-affiliated channels on Telegram, the messaging app, had been discussing the reports of Mr. bin Laden’s death, but there has been no official confirmation or denial from Al Qaeda’s general command.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After an American Navy SEAL team <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/world/asia/osama-bin-laden-is-killed.html?module=inline" title="">killed Hamza’s father in 2011</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.dni.gov/index.php/features/bin-laden-s-bookshelf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">documents recovered</a> from the hide-out in Pakistan showed that Hamza, a favorite of his father, was being groomed for a leadership role in Al Qaeda. From a young age he showed a keen interest in joining his father’s violent campaign against the United States and its allies.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The younger bin Laden was named a member of Al Qaeda in 2014 by his father’s successor, Ayman al-Zawahri. The group’s leaders saw in the young man with the famous name as a figure someone who could attract followers of rival Sunni Islamist groups like the Islamic State.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[A bin Laden family “henchman” </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/world/asia/philippines-al-qaeda-arrest.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">was arrested in the Philippines</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hamza vowed vengeance for his father’s death, calling for attacks on Western capitals and warning Americans that they would be “targeted in the United States and abroad,” according to the State Department.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a series of audio recordings released by Al Qaeda beginning in 2015, Hamza bin Laden called for the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy and urged Syrian jihadi groups to unite to liberate the Palestinians.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In others, he criticized the Obama administration for what he called “hollow lies” and vowed revenge for the death of his father, according to the Soufan Group, a New York-based organization that conducts security analysis.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In another, he offered advice for prospective jihadis to “follow in the footsteps of martyrdom-seekers before,” according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2017/05/hamza-bin-laden-offers-advice-for-martyrdom-seekers-in-the-west.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">analysis from the Long War Journal</a>, a publication from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based policy institute.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he also had another side, according to those close to his father.

But the circumstances were unclear.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That same year, the United States officially listed him as a “global terrorist.” In February of this year, the State Department <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/hamza_bin_laden.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">announced a $1 million reward for information</a> about his whereabouts, and Saudi Arabia revoked his citizenship, but it is not clear whether he was already dead by then. The United Nations Security Council also put him on a sanctions list this year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hamza Osama Muhammad bin Laden was believed to have been born on May, 9 1989, in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, one of 23 children his father would eventually have, according to Western intelligence agencies. His mother is Khairiah Sabar, one of the Qaeda leader’s three surviving wives. The State Department also lists an alterative birth year, 1986.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Osama bin Laden and his family fled Afghanistan after the American invasion in 2001. Before the 2011 mission to kill him, Pakistan had been accused by some American officials of hiding the Qaeda leader. On Thursday, asked about the reports of Hamza bin Laden’s death, a spokesman for Pakistan’s foreign office, Muhammad Faisal, declined to comment.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unconfirmed reports had placed Hamza in several countries. But letters to and from his father indicate that in 2009 and 2010 he was living in Iran, possibly being held against his will by the Shiite authorities there.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More recent reports indicated that he lived in Tehran in an upscale villa with two wives and his sister. Others said he operated in the border areas intersecting Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, but did not live in Iran.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bilal Sarwary, a former BBC reporter in Afghanistan, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/bsarwary/status/1156629476744278016" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">posted on Twitter</a> that he had learned in January that Mr. bin Laden was alive and moving back and forth between Pakistan and Kunar Province in Afghanistan, but that could not be independently verified.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who has been studying the inner workings of Al Qaeda for years, said that the younger bin Laden’s role in the organization remained opaque.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t actually know what his real role was within Al Qaeda,” Mr. Joscelyn said. “We know Al Qaeda was marketing him as a voice for a younger generation; you could see that when they would put out these audio messages from him.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But one thing was clear, he said, Al Qaeda saw him as an heir to his father’s legacy and its fighters were keen to have him take part in their propaganda messaging.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Joscelyn cited evidence in the older bin Laden’s personal files — a trove <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/abbottabad-compound/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">released by the C.I.A. </a>— that his son had received elite training but preferred that he not take on a military role. Hamza’s own ambitions, based on his audio recordings and letters to his father, seemed to indicate a desire to take an active role in Al Qaeda.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Hamza insisted on following in his father’s footprints to a certain degree,” he said, “and he was for certain his father’s biological and ideological heir.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a 2009 letter, the younger bin Laden wrote: “My beloved father, I was separated from you when I was a small child, not yet 13, but I am older now, and have attained manhood.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But what truly makes me sad,” he added, “is the mujahedeen legions have marched and I have not joined them.”</p>
