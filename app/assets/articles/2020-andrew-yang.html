<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It appears that I’m most impressed by a candidate who I’m almost certain can’t win. What a dilemma.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Every so often a candidate runs for president and ends up on the debate stage who so alters the thinking about not only the issues but also what it means to be a political thinker. This year that person is the entrepreneur Andrew Yang.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I first met Yang a couple months ago on the set of “Real Time with Bill Maher.” We guests stood in a gaggle just before showtime and made nervous conversation. He struck me then as completely relaxed, comfortable and sure of himself, not full of himself or trying desperately to impress.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">You may think this a small thing, but I have been in journalism all my adult life, 26 years, and from the experience of meeting countless politicians I can tell you that this is rare. There is something <!-- -->overbearing about them. Greasy is the way I describe them: too slick and too slippery. They are also too forward — too in your face and in your space. What they consider connecting with people I consider glowering over people. What they consider their winning smile looks to me like a scary clown.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So yes, just the way he carried himself signaled that there was something different about this man. And during his opening interview on the show, while I was watching from the wings, I remember thinking to myself: This guy is impressive.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That was the same feeling I got during Wednesday night’s debate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yang seems to always approach his questions and answers from a different perspective, from a higher intellectual and logical plane. His answers were short, pithy and clear as a bell.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yang is a futurist among conventionalists and Bolsheviks.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He is talking about a rise of the machines and valuations of uncompensated labor in a way that doesn’t sound fanciful and outlandish but prudent and necessary. (I do think some of it is fanciful, by the way.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I believe that this is his gift: His ability to explain things, to educate without sounding elitist, to tell you something you don’t know without making you feel guilty for not knowing it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sure, I’m not <!-- -->certain<!-- --> America is ready for this $1,000-a-month scheme and his attempts to flip the Asian-guy-who-likes-math racial trope into a positive that works for him makes me uneasy every time I hear it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But, when I see this guy — honest and unassuming — surrounded on a debate stage by these tacticians and poll watchers, the ones who shade the truth and blow with the wind, the ones consumed by ambition who think too much of themselves, he just stands out.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fact that he doesn’t wear a tie is just a visual reminder that he is a nonconformist — <!-- -->in the best way <!-- -->— to our political pageantry.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As Yang <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/01/transcript-night-second-democratic-debate/?utm_term=.0320e829ef9c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said in one of his last exchanges</a> of the night:</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">You know what the talking heads couldn’t stop talking about after the last debate? It’s not the fact that I’m somehow number four on the stage in national polling. It was the fact that I wasn’t wearing a tie. Instead of talking about automation and our future, including the fact that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs, hundreds of thousands right here in Michigan, we’re up here with makeup on our faces and our rehearsed attack lines, playing roles in this reality TV show. It’s one reason why we elected a reality TV star as our president.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And that is the thing: Campaigns in general and debates in particular are reality TV. He is right. It’s all a show. Candidates release a raft of detailed policy plans, but few voters actually read them. We overwhelmingly select our candidate because of the way they make us feel.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I don’t think Yang has a shot at the nomination — I hate to have to say that because I don’t want to dampen his prospects, but I genuinely believe it — but I certainly hope that he finds a way to stay in the race for a while.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This debate about the direction of the Democratic Party — what it believes and is willing to fight for — would benefit from the continued infusion of his fresh perspectives. And if he doesn’t become the nominee, I certainly hope that he is included in any winning Democrat’s cabinet.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yang knows how to explain. In 2012, President Obama dubbed former President Bill Clinton the “Secretary of Explaining Stuff.” I think the next Democratic president should make that a real job and give it to Andrew Yang. America needs this guy. </p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
