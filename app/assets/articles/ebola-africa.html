<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Faced with a lethal Ebola outbreak threatening eastern Africa, public health officials are conceding that their battle plan is failing and have proposed a comprehensive new strategy for containing the virus. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It envisions reframing the epidemic as a regional humanitarian crisis, not simply a health emergency. That may include more troops or police to quell the murders and arson that have made medical work difficult, as well as food aid to win over skeptical locals. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Democratic Republic of Congo also plans to deploy a second vaccine to form a protective “curtain” of immunity around outbreak areas.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak, which <!-- -->began a year ago<!-- --> in Congo and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/health/ebola-outbreak.html?module=inline" title="">was declared a global health emergency this month</a>, is now the second-biggest in history, with more than <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://who.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/e70c3804f6044652bc37cce7d8fcef6c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">2,600 cases and more than 1,750 dead</a>. It has persisted in part because of a fierce but hidden power struggle within Congo’s government for control of the response, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and interviews with Ebola experts. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The country’s health minister, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/olyilunga?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Dr. Oly Ilunga</a>, resigned on Monday after <!-- -->a public <!-- -->dispute with donors at a meeting in Geneva over whether to roll out the second vaccine, which he opposed.

The report was written by a commission convened by Congo’s new president, some of whose members are now overseeing the response.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The report said “arrogant” national health officials took “an aggressive and ostentatious attitude” when they visited the outbreak area, renting deluxe hotel rooms and expensive cars and “brandishing large dollar bills” while local health workers went unpaid.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A spokeswoman for Dr. Ilunga called the report “weak.” She said he had resigned not because of it, but because the president had split the authority to oversee the response between his office and an independent commission, which she claimed was a violation of the Congolese Constitution. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Ilunga’s departure pleased some donors and agencies supporting the fight against Ebola. The United States is by far the biggest donor. Tibor P. Nagy, the State Department’s top official for African affairs, told a Senate subcommittee on <!-- -->Wednesday <!-- -->that Dr. Ilunga’s resignation “may be an improvement to the situation.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The country is seeking $288 million to implement its new Ebola strategy, and is likely to get it.

Experts hope efforts will be made to negotiate a truce with local militias.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The health ministry’s strategic plan for the period from July to December, written in cooperation with the W.H.O., has not been officially released but is circulating among the donors and health agencies, and a copy was obtained by The Times. While it envisions a much broader response, the plan is vague on specifics — omitting even references to which vaccines should be used. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By contrast, the commission’s report in April endorsed the second vaccine by name and called for many specific actions, like giving hot meals to malnourished children. Because its main authors are now leading the response, experts expect those steps will be taken.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In May, the United Nations made a similar shift.

He said it would confuse the populace and be difficult to administer, since it requires two doses given 56 days apart.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To avoid confusion, it will be deployed differently from the current single-dose Merck vaccine. While that one is used to “ring-vaccinate” everyone around each known case, the new vaccine will be used in areas further away to encircle the hot zones with immunized people.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For example, while the Merck vaccine has been given to Ugandan health workers on the Congo border, the new one will be deployed in Mbarara, a regional capital 60 miles away with a big hospital that ill patients might travel to.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Close to 200,000 doses of the Merck vaccine have been distributed. The company has plans to produce 800,000, but some experts fear shortages, especially if the virus escapes into South Sudan, which is as dysfunctional and war-torn as eastern Congo. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Johnson &amp; Johnson has offered 500,000 doses; the vaccine is easier to store and<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-vaccine/deployment-of-second-ebola-vaccine-would-not-be-quick-fix-experts-warn-idUSKCN1UK1KR" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> has been tested for safety on 6,000 human volunteers</a>, but has not been deployed in the field.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At its core, the political struggle within Congo pitted Dr. Ilunga, 59, who had been a minister since 2016, against Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director-general of the country’s National Institute for Biomedical Research. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It also was a struggle between President Tshisekedi and his predecessor, Joseph Kabila, 48. After 18 contentious years in office, Mr. Kabila stepped down last year and is now a senator for life. In December, Mr. Tshisekedi won a disputed election, beating Mr. Kabila’s chosen successor. But since then, he has only slowly replaced Mr. Kabila’s cabinet ministers. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Ilunga, who visited the outbreak area several times, is respected by some Ebola experts. The head of one international agency, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid involvement in another country’s dispute, called him “principled and data-driven.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Muyembe, 77, is an internationally respected authority on Ebola who has helped fight every outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1976, when the country was named Zaire.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The report by the commission led by Dr. Muyembe accused Dr. Ilunga of “weak governance, weak leadership and a hyper-centralized response” that failed to coordinate with other ministries, including the police and army. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to accusing Dr. Ilunga and his staff of arrogance and ostentation, the report also cataloged serious medical failures. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">People with fevers who entered screening centers to see if they had Ebola did not get test results for three to five days, by which time they might become infected with Ebola — or infect others if they had it. Private clinics and traditional healers held patients in order to make money and little was done to protect areas where the virus had not yet appeared or to coordinate with neighboring countries, the report said. And while the commission’s field visits had gone “generally well,” its work was hampered because Dr. Ilunga had refused repeated requests to meet with members and his office had been uncooperative with information requests.</p><p class="css-1vs7yia interactive-leadin" data-testid="leadin" id="interactive-leadin">Reported cases by health zone, as of July 21.</p><p class="g-pstyle0">LAKE</p><p class="g-pstyle0">ALBERT</p><p class="g-pstyle1">DEM.
