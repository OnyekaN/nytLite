<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HOUSTON — There is no stage in sports quite like it. In football and basketball and hockey, in boxing and tennis and soccer, every competitor stands on a level playing surface. Not so in baseball, where one performer starts the action from a raised circle in the center of it all.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Everything flows from the pitcher, and the <!-- -->115th World Series, <!-- -->starting here Tuesday between the Houston Astros and the Washington Nationals, could be a spectacle of dominance from the mound.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Astros are the only American League team with three starters who worked 200 innings this season: Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and <!-- -->Zack Greinke<!-- -->. The Nationals are the only National League team with two such starters — Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin — plus a third, Max Scherzer, who <!-- -->led the N.L. in strikeouts per nine innings<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I can’t speak for all the fans, but I’m looking forward to the fact that we might see a Cole and a Scherzer or a Strasburg and a Verlander go toe-to-toe for seven or eight innings,” said Jim Kaat, who pitched <!-- -->25 seasons<!-- --> in the majors. “I’ve always thought when you come to the ballpark, you look at the starting pitchers.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kaat, <!-- -->80<!-- -->, debuted for the original Washington Senators in 1959, starting the <!-- -->16th consecutive defeat of an 18-game losing streak<!-- --> for the team. The Senators had the league’s <!-- -->worst record<!-- --> and <!-- -->lowest attendance<!-- -->, and moved to Minnesota <!-- -->two years<!-- --> later.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A replacement franchise, also named the Senators, moved to Texas in 1972, and baseball did not return to Washington until the league moved the Montreal Expos there in 2005. This is the first World Series for a Washington team since 1933, and it did not come easily: The Nationals started <!-- -->19-31<!-- --> and overcame deficits in the wild card game and the division series <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/sports/baseball/nationals-world-series.html?module=inline" title="">before sweeping St. Louis for the pennant</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m happy for the Washington fans, even though it’s changed ownership so often,” said Kaat, who will watch the World Series from his home in Vermont. “Now when you mention the original Senators, a lot of people don’t know what you’re talking about. They think of the Texas Rangers or the Montreal Expos. But I’m happy for whatever fans are left there in Washington to be able to experience that.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kaat experienced the World Series with the <!-- -->Twins in 1965<!-- -->, losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a series that featured <!-- -->seven complete games<!-- -->, one each day. Years later, as a television reporter, Kaat covered the 1991 World Series, when a future Hall of Famer <!-- -->pitched all 10 innings of the finale<!-- --> to lead the Twins to the title.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s still one of my highlights, to see that Jack Morris 1-0 game in Game 7,” Kaat said. “And these pitchers, the ones they have right now with Houston and Washington, they’re certainly capable of doing that.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chances are we will not see any pitcher complete a start in this World Series; Verlander threw a no-hitter last month, but the teams combined for just two additional complete games all season. Yet there is something reassuring about a matchup between the two postseason teams that got the most innings from their starters in the regular season.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While many teams have reimagined their pitching philosophy — asking less of starters in an effort to maximize strikeouts and, they hope, minimize injury risk — two collections of durable, dominant aces are left standing at the end of this season.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I personally am a big fan of starting pitching,” said Cole, who will face Scherzer in Game 1. “And there are a lot of really good starting pitchers on the other side of the field, guys that kind of emulate the role in terms of longevity, durability, creativeness, tenacity, grit. It’s just a pleasure to share the field with them on the greatest stage.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Using an opener — as the Yankees and the Astros did in the decisive Game 6 of the A.L. Championship Series, which ended on a homer by second baseman Jose Altuve — can sometimes make sense, Verlander said, but not in the long run.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Throughout the course of a long season, 162 games, I think those guys that can go out and take the ball every five days are extremely valuable,” said Verlander, who will start Game 2. “And I think they should be looked at as such.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Astros and the Nationals have paid top prices for their rotations. Houston traded 12 players in four deals to get Verlander, Cole and Greinke. Washington outbid the industry to sign Scherzer and Corbin as free agents, and gave a lucrative contract extension to the homegrown Strasburg.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The six aces average more than $25 million per season in salary, with Cole ready for a free-agency bonanza this winter. The Nationals’ fourth starter, the veteran Anibal Sanchez, was a bargain free agent (two years, $19 million) who nearly pitched a no-hitter in the N.L. Championship Series.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are plenty of offensive stars in this matchup, especially third baseman Anthony Rendon and outfielder Juan Soto of the Nationals, and the Astros’ core of Altuve, third baseman Alex Bregman, shortstop Carlos Correa and center fielder George Springer, the most valuable player of the Astros’ victory in the 2017 World Series.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the theme of these games is easy to spot. According to research by James Smyth of the YES Network, this is the first World Series since 1912 with six pitchers coming off seasons of at least five wins above replacement. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s going to be a World Series dominated by starting pitching,” Astros General Manager Jeff Luhnow said. “Bullpens are going to matter, offense is going to matter, they have an M.V.P. candidate, we have an M.V.P. candidate, they have a deep lineup, they’ve got guys in the bullpen who can get outs late in the game. But when you talk about Scherzer, Strasburg and Corbin, and then you talk about the guys on our side, this is going to be fun.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For all of their combined success — <!-- -->29 All-Star teams, 10 league strikeout titles, five Cy Young Awards<!-- -->, plus another to come this winter for Verlander or Cole — none of the six pitchers have ever won a game in the World Series.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cole, Corbin, Greinke and Strasburg have never made it until now. Scherzer has just one start (a <!-- -->no-decision for Detroit in 2012<!-- -->) and Verlander is 0-4 with a <!-- -->5.67<!-- --> earned run average in <!-- -->five<!-- --> starts, <!-- -->none lasting more than six innings<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Verlander did pitch the last postseason complete game, in the 2017 A.L.C.S. against the Yankees, when he was the M.V.P. He has built a 15-year resume worthy of the Hall of Fame, and some of the other aces here will surely follow him to Cooperstown. Their performances in the next few days could someday be etched there in gold, highlights of a well-armed World Series that should be a purist’s delight.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Astros are just the sixth franchise to string together three consecutive seasons with at least 100 victories, joining the Yankees (2002-04), the Braves (1997-99), the Orioles (1969-71), the Cardinals (1942-44) and the Athletics (1929-31). Houston has a chance to join the Cardinals and the Athletics as the only teams to win two World Series titles within that run; the Yankees and Braves did not win the World Series in any of those seasons, and the Orioles won just once.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Seven spring training facilities are shared by two teams, but only one can claim both league champions as tenants: The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach, Fla., the spring home of both the Astros and the Nationals. The Dodgers and the White Sox share a complex in Glendale, Ariz., but their World Series matchup, in 1959, happened decades before they bunked together in the desert.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While red is the Nationals’ primary color, navy seems to be working best this October. The Nats are undefeated this postseason in seven games wearing their navy blue jerseys, using them in all three of their division series victories over the Dodgers (in Games 2, 4 and 5) and throughout their four-game sweep of the Cardinals in the N.L.C.S. The jerseys, with “Nationals” at a diagonal angle in white script across the front, are worn with an alternate cap — navy crown, red brim, and a white, curly-W logo that closely resembles the Walgreens insignia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Baseball first expanded in 1961, and nearly half of all current teams (14 of 30) started as expansion franchises. Yet this is only the second World Series matchup ever to feature two expansion teams, after the 2015 Series between the Kansas City Royals and the Mets. The Astros started as the Colt .45s in 1962, and the Nationals as the Montreal Expos in 1969.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Astros’ Brad Peacock, who got the first five outs for Houston in Game 6 of the A.L.C.S., is the only player who has played only for the Nationals and the Astros — and no other teams — in his career. Peacock debuted with three games for Washington in 2011 and was traded from Oakland to Houston for Jed Lowrie in 2013. Others to play for the Astros and the Nationals (among other teams) include Aaron Boone, Tyler Clippard, Brad Lidge, Mark Melancon, C.J. Nitkowski, Oliver Perez and the Hall of Famer Ivan Rodriguez.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nationals reliever Fernando Rodney, <!-- -->42<!-- -->, is the only <!-- -->active major leaguer born in the 1970s<!-- -->. If he makes an appearance — with his trademark off-center cap, a tribute to his late father — Rodney would be the oldest player in the World Series since 2008, when Jamie Moyer, then 45, started for the Phillies. Rodney reached the World Series with his first team, the Detroit Tigers, <!-- -->in 2006<!-- -->, and toiled for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/sports/baseball/minnesota-twins-fernando-rodney.html?module=inline" title="">nine different teams</a> before making it back: the Angels, the Rays, the Mariners, the Cubs, the Padres, the Marlins, the Diamondbacks, the Twins and the A’s.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only two World Series <!-- -->games<!-- --> this decade have ended with a home run: by St. Louis’ David Freese in 2011 (Game 6) and the Dodgers’ Max Muncy in 2018 (Game 3). If someone does it this time, bet on the Nationals’ Ryan Zimmerman. He homered to end the first game at Nationals Park in 2008 and has launched <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5i03jPuY2LA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">11 walk-off shots</a> in his career, just two shy of Jim Thome’s career record. Then again, maybe the Astros are the better bet to do it in this series: both of their home victories in the A.L.C.S. ended with homers, by Carlos Correa in Game 2 and Jose Altuve in Game 6.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While most relievers still opt to jog to the mound from the bullpen, Washington’s Sean Doolittle and Fernando Rodney take advantage of a retro perk few teams offer: the bullpen car. The Nationals park theirs beyond the center field fence, and it scoots over to the right field corner whenever the Nats make a pitching change, just in case a reliever needs a lift.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Six sitting presidents have thrown out a ceremonial first pitch at the World Series: Woodrow Wilson (1915), Calvin Coolidge (1924 and 1925), Herbert Hoover (1929 and 1930), Dwight Eisenhower (1955), Jimmy Carter (1979) and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjGcCI9ByWw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">George W. Bush (2001)</a>. With the World Series returning to Washington for the first time since 1933, President Trump might seem to be a natural fit to join the list. But while every president since William Howard Taft has thrown a ceremonial pitch at least once while in office, the 45th president has yet to do so, and the league and the White House have had no contact about a possible appearance at the World Series.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While there may not be an actual president in attendance, the Nationals stage a daily race with their Mount Rushmore mascots: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.mlb.com/nationals/fans/racing-presidents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Their website</a> describes Washington as “the quintessential champion,” Jefferson as “more bookish than athletic,” Lincoln as capable of “emancipating himself from the pack” and Roosevelt as a competitor who “doesn’t like to play by the rules.” Teddy, as he is known, once had a losing streak that lasted nearly seven full seasons — matching the team’s string of <!-- -->seven consecutive <!-- -->seasons without a winning record after moving from Montreal in 2005. The Astros do not have a mascot race, but their furry green cheerleader, Orbit, has been known to strip to his underwear and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKAGn88xanA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">streak across the field</a> when the spirit moves him.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Robert Ford, an Astros radio broadcaster, uses a rapid <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9kJl7H43vI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“See you later!”</a> for his home run calls. Bob Carpenter, a Nationals television broadcaster, uses more deliberate <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iw9j5AZEuI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“See. You. Later!”</a> for his. Alas, only Ford will be behind the microphone for the World Series, because while M.L.B. permits local radio broadcasts in the World Series, Fox has exclusive TV rights. As for Carpenter, then, Nationals fans will have to see him later.</p><p class="css-1uuihdo">Despite a perceived decline, Major League Baseball, when viewed through the lens of ticket sales and television ratings, is not only popular, but primed for growth.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">David Waldstein contributed reporting.</p>
