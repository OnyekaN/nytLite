<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cory was the new Kamala. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the second Democratic debate, the New Jersey senator took up where the California senator left off in the first one — with an aghast look into Joe Biden’s past. Booker demanded that Biden own up to and defend his major role in 1990s criminal justice legislation that helped lead to mass incarceration.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses because you stood up and used that ‘tough on crime’ phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine,” Booker said, referring to Newark.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kirsten was also the new Kamala.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The New York senator pressed for an explanation of seemingly derogatory statements that Biden once made about women working outside the home. Looking pained and sounding outraged, Gillibrand sought the sort of moment — and the sort of bounce — that Harris got after she confronted Biden about his position in the 1970s on school busing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But then Bill de Blasio was the new Kamala and Julián Castro was the new Kamala and even Kamala was the new Kamala, all of them determined to throw Biden off his stride and accelerate their own march forward in the process.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/frank-bruni?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Get a more personal take on politics, newsmakers and more with Frank Bruni’s exclusive commentary every week.

He was more composed. He obviously expected every attack and had clearly rehearsed his responses, so that he never had the hapless, helpless look of his prior outing. If his rivals expected Wednesday night to be the beginning of the end for him, they were wrong.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And yet Biden hardly put the doubts about his sturdiness and stamina to rest. I so hoped and I so want to say otherwise, because I believe him to be a decent man, because he’s talking more sense than many of his starry-eyed adversaries, because it may well be that among the voters who will decide this election in the places where President Trump plans to fight hardest, Biden is a better — or at least safer — bet than any of the other candidates getting more than 2 percent in national polls right now.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there’s that way in which he trails off at the end of a sentence or an argument, all the little hiccups en route, the messy seams connecting one thought to the next, the demeanor that falls into a maddening gray area between engaged and fully animated. If Booker and de Blasio traffic in too many exclamation points, Biden traffics in too many ellipses.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">My heart did a little jig as I listened to his closing statement, because it had the right measures of poetry and simplicity and because its assertion about the imperiled soul of America was so true. But my heart died a little death when he reached the end, because he rattled off what sounded at first like the address for a website in such a strangled fashion that I couldn’t tell how many threes and zeros it contained and in which order.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That was Biden, building toward something big only to peter out.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’m focusing so much on him because so much of the focus was on him. The debate in Detroit among the second group of 10 Democrats wasn’t principally about health care, immigration, race relations or climate change — not in terms of the question foremost on many observers’ minds, the matter that cried out loudest for resolution. The debate was about whether the man at the prime lectern, with a very big lead, had lost his famous ebullience and parted with his former confidence.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was quarry: That much was indisputable. Someone who’d never read a word about the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination before Wednesday night could have tuned into almost any 10-minute stretch and figured out that he was the front-runner, because the overwhelming majority of arrows were flying in his direction (though some very sharp ones came Harris’s way).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">De Blasio was perhaps the most insistent archer. The most obnoxious, too. And it was powerful testimony to Biden’s enduring political skill that he turned that into a joke. “I love your affection for me,” Biden told de Blasio. “You spend a lot of time with me.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Biden’s ability to keep from sweating and to keep smiling was no mean feat under the circumstances. He parried Gillibrand by noting that in years past, she was a fan of his. “I don’t know what’s happened except that you’re now running for president,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in his back-and-forth with Booker, during which he disparaged Booker’s approach to policing as mayor of Newark, he lacked Booker’s crispness and clearness. And Booker got the better of him. “Mr. Vice President,” he said, “there’s a saying in my community — you’re dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don’t even know the flavor.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A few facets of Biden’s candidacy came into sharper relief. One was how much he’s riding — and counting — on his association with President Barack Obama and how complicated that tactic is. Biden summoned him as a character witness, but that opened the door for rivals to press Biden on parts of Obama’s presidency — all the deportations of undocumented immigrants, for example — that don’t look so rosy or fit so neatly into Democratic priorities now.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And it gave Booker the grist to portray Biden as a shifty opportunist. “You can’t have it both ways,” Booker said. “You invoke President Obama more than anybody in this campaign. You can’t do it when it’s convenient and then dodge it when it’s not.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The debate also made clear how untenable Biden’s initial, preferred approach to this race was. He wanted to float above the fray, attacking Trump rather than brawling with his fellow Democrats. He wanted to seem bigger. He wanted to be sunnier.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But his rivals were never going to let that happen, and they didn’t. They insisted that he scrap with them, on their level. They wagered that to rise up they had to knock him down a peg or two. It was ugly, but more than that, it was frustrating, because none of them emerged as the person who should take Biden’s place at the head of the pack and graduate to the all-important face-off against Trump.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And yet Biden didn’t seem ready for that matchup himself. I kept looking for an assurance that he couldn’t deliver, listening for a lyricism that he couldn’t manage, praying for a sign that after two miserably failed presidential candidacies, the third time would be the charm for Biden and our amulet against Trump. I didn’t get that guarantee from him, but then I didn’t get it from anyone else, including the 10 candidates who debated the night before.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Is it possible that the Democrats have an overflow of talent but no one who’s precisely right? I worry, and not just because that’s my occupation.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
