<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sarah Parcak, an archaeologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has scoured the globe for the faded outlines of Egyptian cities, Viking ruins and other ancient sites — often with a camera crew watching over her shoulder.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She specializes in finding good places to dig in satellite imagery before anyone even lifts a trowel.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In <!-- -->a book to be published on Tuesday<!-- -->, “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250198280" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Archaeology From Space: How the Future Shapes Our Past</a>,” Dr. Parcak recounts her globe-trotting adventures and describes how the view from above has revolutionized her field. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On a recent morning, I talked with her via Skype about how the rise and fall of ancient civilizations might light the way through our own struggles. Below are edited excerpts from our conversation. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before we even start looking, we spend a lot of time looking at articles and books. What are the types of features that you might find in this area? And then we start testing different algorithms, or different remote sensing processing techniques.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s kind of like a detective investigation, right? We’re looking at what techniques, what satellites, what processing methods work — 999 times out of 1,000, you fail miserably, because welcome to science. But you have those one or two things that may be a hint of something. And you just keep noodling at it until you figure out what works.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yeah, so I was actually known as “that satellite girl,” which is problematic on so many levels.<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>But<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>there was a cohort of us in the early 2000s that really started applying the technology on a much larger scale. I think the work that I and many of my colleagues did helped to open a lot of people’s eyes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I gave a talk at a big archaeology conference about 10 years ago, and this creaky, elderly professor from Harvard, a very eminent scholar, came up to me. I thought, “Oh no, he’s going to say something.” He goes, “When I get home, I’m going to do a Google.” Like, he was going to check out Google Earth and look at his sites. I’m like, yes!</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So yeah, it’s been a battle. But I think we’re there.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When you look at what books are in the archaeology section of a bookstore, it’s mostly these pseudo-archaeological books by people who write that aliens built pyramids or other outlandish theories. And that’s not what archaeology is.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Archaeology is this incredibly rich field that helps to show the full trajectory of our humanity, all the good and all the bad, all our creativity, all of our foibles, the fact that our common humanity hasn’t evolved in 300,000 years — while our technology has. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That’s really why I wanted to write this book. I wanted to show how archaeology really works, and what we actually do with the evidence we have, and how all these amazing new technologies are helping us to ask new, bigger and better questions about the past.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are two different strands. On the one hand, you have something like a PBS “Nova” special, which is beautifully shot and carefully researched. Keep doing those. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And then you have “Ancient Aliens,” on the History Channel. If you look at<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2018/10/16/paranormal-america-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> a survey that was done by Chapman University</a>, we’ve seen a significant increase in the number of people in the U.S. who believe that ancient aliens built or had an influence on ancient cultures.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I watch these shows because I want to be educated, and you have engage with these people to try to change minds. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is about 4,200 years ago. Egypt relied on the flooding of the Nile every year. If you have a consistent pattern of years and years and years of poor floods, that’s going to cause a drought. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">You also have this king, Pepi II, who ruled for about 90 years. And you had a weakening economy. So you had political instability, economic insecurity — and obviously the drought as well — causing social instability. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a result of this, you had no foreign expeditions, you had no more pyramid building. You have this massive drop in the quality of the art. It’s like no one was going to college to learn how to draw anymore. It was definitely at least a generation, if not two, before things started to get better.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s real familiar. Yeah.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If somehow we can figure out how to make economic opportunity more equitable, we’ve got a chance of getting through this. And that’s certainly the lesson that the end of the Old Kingdom teaches us. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">You obviously had massive power, massive wealth focused in the hands of the king and his court. There was a very clearly defined lower class that wouldn’t have had, say, opportunities to get money to have nice burials — that’s really how we look at economic differences in the archaeological record.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as the money toward the end of the Old Kingdom flowed to the provinces, there was more economic and artistic social independence. More people had more access to more opportunities. And that’s when you really see the developing of more regional art styles in Egypt, as well. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So yeah, I think there’s a big lesson for us. More economic opportunities in more regional areas could lead to flourishing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We’re not far away from satellite imagery that has a resolution of three inches. Imagine being able to zoom in from space and see a shard of pottery — we’re really close to that.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The other thing is that the field is shifting from satellite to drones. We’re not quite there yet, but within a couple years, we’re going to be able to capture very high resolution hyperspectral data, and laser mapping from autonomous vehicles, and that is going to transform the field as much as satellite imagery has.</p>
