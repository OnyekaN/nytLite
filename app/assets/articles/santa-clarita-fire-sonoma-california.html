<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SANTA CLARITA, Calif. — A fire that forced the evacuation of 50,000 people spread through canyons north of Los Angeles on Friday, jumping a freeway and threatening thousands of homes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like the Kincade Fire, a blaze raging through the forests and vineyards of Northern California, the Tick Fire in Santa Clarita was driven by strong autumn winds. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authorities ordered all public schools in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando Valleys to be closed on Friday, and the closing of a major freeway snarled rush-hour traffic.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles and Sonoma Counties because of the fires. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At a news briefing Friday morning, the authorities said the Tick Fire had burned 4,300 acres and was 5 percent contained. They said they had determined that six structures had burned so far.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“However, we know that it’s going to rise today,” said Chief Daryl L. Osby, of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said that there were actually no active fires at the moment, but that the ground was smoldering and the winds were whipping — they are dealing with “significant and erratic winds.” The worry is that new fires could ignite at any moment.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“At any moment an ember could get out of our containment line,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, he said the authorities would consider repopulating certain areas by Friday afternoon. Aircraft have been used to fight the Tick Fire, and 600 firefighters have been deployed, he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chief Osby said he was pleased to see so many residents heed the evacuation orders, saying many did so because of memories of last season’s deadly fires. But he said he was concerned that some chose to ignore the orders, and were staying in their homes within the evacuation zones.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dangerous winds are forecast to continue on Friday in the Los Angeles area, challenging the hundreds of firefighters deployed to contain the Tick Fire, the National Weather Service said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Winds in the mountains will have gusts between 50 and 60 miles per hour and relative humidity will remain in the single digits, said Curt Kaplan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service who covers the Los Angeles area.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s going to cause extreme fire behavior with rapid rate of spread,” Mr. Kaplan said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although the winds are set to subside on Friday evening, they are forecast to return on Sunday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The combination of very dry conditions with strong winds and dry fuels — it’s just not a good combination,” Mr. Kaplan said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The threatening weather conditions arriving over the weekend prompted the state’s largest electrical utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, to warn of another large-scale power outage that will affect areas north and east of San Francisco. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Peak fire season is far from over in California but the wildfires this year have been less catastrophic as those of the past two years. Fewer than 300 structures have burned in wildfires so far this year compared with more than 23,000 in all of last year. And around 163,000 acres have burned this year, according to Cal Fire, the state’s fire agency, compared with 1.6 million acres in all of 2018.</p><p class="css-1uuihdo">A fire near Los Angeles on Thursday forced 50,000 people to evacuate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Around midnight, police officers drove through Frank Cruz’s neighborhood near Santa Clarita, blaring sirens and announcing that all residents must leave, as high winds were fanning a quickly moving brush fire. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By Friday morning, Mr. Cruz, and his wife, Cindy, who is seven months pregnant, were waking up in their car, in the parking lot of a Denny’s. Ms. Cruz<!-- -->, who has lived in the area for more than a decade and had never been forced to evacuate for a fire,<!-- --> said she thought there were so many evacuations because of an abundance of caution.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After last year’s deadly fire season in California, she said, people “aren’t taking any chances.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the Paradise Fire in Northern California claiming more than 80 lives last year, and the Woolsey Fire tearing a destructive path through Malibu and its environs, this year everyone — power companies, fire and law enforcement agencies, residents — is extra cautious. The authorities seem to be quicker to order evacuations at the first sign of fire. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And residents, who in past years may have shrugged off evacuation orders, preferring to remain home and, if necessary, protect their houses, are heeding orders. They are readying their cars, packing them with valuables, just in case they get the order.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think people are listening more,” said Mary Lindsey, 64, who on Friday morning was eating breakfast at a Red Cross center in a gymnasium at the College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita. “In the past there’d be evacuation orders and people would blow them off. After last year, they aren’t doing that.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Lindsey’s husband, Charles, said the fire started in a canyon near their home and quickly burned through dry shrub land that had grown during the heavy rains earlier this year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“With the winds blowing, it moved fast,” said Mr. Lindsey, 68, his dog Ivy at his feet. “In the middle of the night, if you’re told to go, you go.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only one shelter was opened Thursday, and only about 400 people showed up there, according to Roxanne Schorbach, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross. (A second shelter, at a local high school, opened Friday.) The evacuees slept Thursday night on cots in the college gymnasium, many with their pets, and on Friday morning were eating pancakes and bagels and awaiting news.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As smoke swept across the Bay Area on Friday, San Francisco International Airport prepared for flight delays. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Reduced visibility could lead the F.A.A. to implement a delay program,” said Doug Yakel, a spokesman for the airport.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fire-related delays were not expected at the Oakland International Airport or the San Jose International Airport, according to representatives there.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though air quality across the Bay Area fell into the moderate category Friday morning, it was expected to get worse as northwest winds pushed smoke across the region, according to Ralph Borrmann, a spokesman for Bay Area Air Quality Management District, which posts updates on its <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.baaqmd.gov/about-air-quality/current-air-quality/air-monitoring-data/#/aqi?id=316&amp;date=2019-10-25&amp;view=hourly" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">hourly tracker.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Kincade Fire had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/us/sonoma-county-fire-geyserville.html?module=inline" title="">destroyed 49 structures and burned 16,000 acres in Sonoma County</a> as of Thursday night, according to Cal Fire.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About 1,300 firefighters were battling the blaze, which was about 5 percent contained. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Governor Newsom was set to travel to Sonoma County on Friday to visit communities impacted by the Kincade Fire.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Evacuation orders covered 2,000 people, according to the authorities in Sonoma County. Wind gusts blew the fire through forests, leaving firefighters with little opportunity to stop or slow down the walls of flames after the fire began on Wednesday night. Sonoma County was ravaged in 2017, when the Sonoma Complex fires killed 24 and burned more than 170 square miles.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The power was on at an IHOP in Napa, and it became a refuge for some who lacked it at home.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Barbara Tonsberg, 93, a former church organist and high school math teacher, was eating pancakes because there was not much to do with the electricity cut off at her home in nearby Angwin.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Drying your hair doesn’t work too well without power,” Ms. Tonsberg said. “I’m tired of cold food, but there’s nothing you can do but deal with it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As she spoke, her son, Wayne, got a call on his cellphone. It was an automated message from PG&amp;E. He was advised that the company could not predict when their power would return — and that it might go out again Saturday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pacific Gas &amp; Electric said it was investigating whether its equipment had been involved in stoking the Kincade Fire. PG&amp;E said it had become aware that a “transmission-level outage” occurred in the area around the time the fire began. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By early Friday morning, most utility customers across California had their power restored.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By late Thursday, just shy of 100 percent of the 179,000 PG&amp;E customers who lost power had electricity. Most of the remaining customers without power were in Kern County, where high winds continued to blow.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the utility issued a fresh warning early Friday morning that meteorologists expected another round of high winds to affect Northern California, beginning Saturday. The company said the weather conditions and the time needed to restore any damaged equipment could leave a far larger number of customers without power for more than 48 hours.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During his daily news conference, Bill Johnson, PG&amp;E Corporation’s chief executive officer, said this weekend’s weather could bring the strongest winds of the wildfire season so far.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">PG&amp;E said it was trying to contact customers who might be affected by telephone, text and email.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Southern California Edison reduced the number of customers it had blacked out to just over 21,000 but kept almost 400,000 customers under warning for possible power shut-off.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Kincade and Tick fires in California are the latest in the state to force evacuations and threaten homes. Earlier this month the Saddleridge and Saddlewood fires swept across Southern California prompting the question: Is this the new normal?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The total area burned in a single year by wildfires in the United States has exceeded 13,900 square miles — an area larger than the country of Belgium — only four times since the middle of last century. All four times have happened this decade, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/projects/firex-aq/whitepaper.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA</a>. As a result, government agencies are preparing themselves to deal with fires that are increasingly seen as inevitable.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some times, it means setting fires on purpose — a practice known as prescribed burns — or trying to understand how wildfire smoke behaves to be better prepared to warn residents of the risks.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">[<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/climate/california-wildfires-climate-change.html?module=inline" title="">Read more: A Forecast for a Warming World: Learn to Live With Fire.</a> ]</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>
