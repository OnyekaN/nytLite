<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Consuming flavonoids, a large class of nutrients found in plant foods, may reduce the risk for cancer and cardiovascular death.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Researchers used data on 56,048 Danes, following their diet and health prospectively for 23 years. During that time, 14,083 of them died. The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">study is in Nature Communications</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After controlling for smoking, hypertension, cholesterol and many other health and dietary factors, they found that compared with people in the lowest one-fifth for flavonoid intake, those in the highest one-fifth had a 17 percent reduced risk for all-cause mortality, a 15 percent reduced risk for cardiovascular disease death, and a 20 percent reduced risk for cancer mortality. The association peaked at about 500 milligrams of flavonoids a day, and was stronger for smokers, heavy drinkers and the obese.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Good sources of flavonoids include tea, chocolate, red wine, citrus fruits, berries, apples and broccoli. One cup of tea, one apple, one orange, and three-and-a-half ounces each of blueberries and broccoli would supply more than 500 milligrams of total ﬂavonoids.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Participants with a higher flavonoid intake also tended to have a healthier diet over all,” said the lead author, Nicola P. Bondonno, a postdoctoral fellow at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Australia. “But flavonoids were still associated with a lower risk of death after adjusting for other dietary components, as well as within the group of participants with the highest fruit and vegetable intakes.”</p>
