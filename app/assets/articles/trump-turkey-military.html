<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was just five years ago that an American president, faced with a crisis on Syria’s border, acted decisively and honorably.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Barack Obama responded with airstrikes and a rescue operation in 2014 when the Islamic State started a genocide against members of the Yazidi sect, slaughtering men and forcing women and girls into sexual slavery. Obama’s action, along with a heroic intervention by Kurdish fighters, saved tens of thousands of Yazidi lives.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“While America has never been able to right every wrong, America has made the world a more secure and prosperous place,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/2014/8/7/5981449/president-obamas-full-statement-on-the-iraq-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Obama declared</a> at the time. “And our leadership is necessary to underwrite the global security and prosperity that our children and our grandchildren will depend upon.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Contrast Obama’s move, successfully working with allies to avert a genocide, with President Trump’s betrayal this month of those same Kurdish partners in a way that handed a victory to the Islamic State, Turkey, Syria, Iran — and, of course, Russia, because almost everything Trump does seems to end up benefiting Moscow.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Who can trust Trump’s America?” The Economist magazine asks on its<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.economist.com/printedition/2019-10-19" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> newest cover</a>. Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, added: “What we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump doubled down by saying that the Kurds were “no angels” and compared the fighting in Syria that he unleashed — with hundreds dead and 300,000 displaced — to a couple of kids fighting in a vacant lot. His own former special envoy, Brett McGurk, responded on Twitter: “This is an obscene and ignorant statement.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Given the Kurdish heroism in arresting genocide against the Yazidi in 2014, it is savagely ironic that Trump’s betrayal has now put the Kurds themselves at risk of war crimes and ethnic cleansing by Turkey. Gunmen backed by Turkey dragged a female Kurdish politician, Hevrin Khalaf, from her car by her hair, beat her and broke her legs, facial bones and skull, and then shot her dead. When a friend called her phone afterward, a man answered and said, “You Kurds are traitors,” according to Amnesty International, which also said Turkish military forces and a coalition of Turkey-backed Syrian armed groups have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/10/syria-damning-evidence-of-war-crimes-and-other-violations-by-turkish-forces-and-their-allies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">carried out war crimes</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/17/turkish-proxies-chemical-weapons-syria-kurds/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">are reports</a> of Turkish-backed forces using white phosphorus or napalm on civilians, and that’s after the supposed cease-fire that Vice President Mike Pence claimed to have reached with Turkey. It’s nauseating to hear Trump claim that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/world/middleeast/trump-pence-syria-turkey-ceasefire.html?module=inline" title="">this cave-in</a> represents “a great day for civilization” and that “millions of lives will be saved.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A former United Nations official emailed me, aghast, to compare the deal to the 1938 Munich Agreement “peace for our time.” He added that even Neville Chamberlain never agreed to help move the Czechs out of Sudetenland.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Trump has emphasized his desire to bring American troops home, and that’s a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2019/10/18/what-trump-actually-gets-right-about-syria-pub-80111" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">perfectly reasonable aspiration</a> if undertaken in a prudent way. But even as Trump abandoned the Kurds and unleashed this disaster, he was actually increasing the number of American soldiers in the Middle East — sending some <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/world/middleeast/trump-saudi-arabia-iran-troops.html?module=inline" title="">3,000 additional troops</a> to Saudi Arabia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So we’re sending more troops to Saudi Arabia to help a misogynist dictatorship that kills a journalist for an American newspaper, even as we betray the Kurds who have been trying to build a democratic enclave that empowers women; we’re sending troops to Saudi Arabia to confront Iran, even as we give Iran a helping hand in Syria.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is where incoherence and inhumanity converge.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Foreign policy is what I’ll be remembered for,” Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/world/middleeast/trump-turkey-syria.html?module=inline" title="">boasted</a> in 2017 to my colleague <!-- -->David E. Sanger. Well, um, yes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By failing to prepare for a phone call with Turkey’s leader, and then allowing himself to be manipulated, Trump undid years of work in the Middle East. But he also is corroding the entire 75-year-old American postwar international order, built on American credibility and values. Everyone knew that the United States did not always live up to its rhetoric but also that its ideals and commitments counted for <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">something</em>. Until now.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I began this column with a note of praise for Obama for confronting the Yazidi genocide and saving many lives. It’s also true that Syria was Obama’s greatest foreign policy failure, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/11/opinion/obamas-worst-mistake.html?searchResultPosition=3&amp;module=inline" title="">I repeatedly</a> criticized <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/09/opinion/kristof-obama-awol-in-syria.html?module=inline" title="">his passivity</a> as hundreds of thousands were killed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet at least Obama was always wrestling deeply with the issues, seeking out expert opinions and trying to make the most informed decisions possible.
