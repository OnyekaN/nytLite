<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday abruptly dropped his plan to nominate Representative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, as the nation’s top intelligence official, following bipartisan questions about his qualifications and pushback over whether he had exaggerated his resume.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Ratcliffe, an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump, has come under intense scrutiny since the president declared Sunday on Twitter that the lawmaker was his pick to succeed Dan Coats, who is stepping down as director of national intelligence on August 15. The selection generated scant enthusiasm among senators of both parties who would have been tasked with deciding whether to confirm him.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1157352000327180289" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> announcement that Mr. Ratcliffe would not be his nominee after all, also made on Twitter</a>, spoke bitterly of the attention Mr. Ratcliffe’s claims about his experience as a federal prosecutor quickly received from the news media.</p><p dir="ltr" lang="en">....John has therefore decided to stay in Congress where he has done such an outstanding job representing the people of Texas, and our Country. I will be announcing my nomination for DNI shortly.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The announcement was another reversal for the president and underscored recurring dysfunction in the White House vetting process that has plagued the administration since its transition. Mr. Ratcliffe joined a long list of Trump appointees who have had to pull their names after the president announced his plans to put them in powerful posts, without a full picture of potentially disqualifying details.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The backtrack leaves Mr. Trump without any obvious candidate to fill one of the country’s most important national-security jobs, heightening scrutiny on what will happen with Sue Gordon, the nation’s No. 2 intelligence official. Mr. Trump has already decided not to allow her to rise to the role of acting director of national intelligence when Mr. Coats steps down, according to people familiar with his plans.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The decision to circumvent Ms. Gordon, who has served as the principal deputy director in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, will probably upset Republicans and Democrats in the Senate who had expressed doubts about Mr. Ratcliffe.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump did not allow Ms. Gordon to personally deliver a recent intelligence briefing after she arrived at the White House, according to a person familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman for the Office of the Director of the National Intelligence, Amanda J. Schoch, said Ms. Gordon was not blocked from attending any recent briefing, but she declined to comment about what happened inside the Oval Office.</p>
