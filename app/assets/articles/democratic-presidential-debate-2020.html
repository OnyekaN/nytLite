You can find my full ratings, and those of other Times columnists, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/31/opinion/debate-winners-losers.html" title="">here</a>. The consensus winner, based on our grades: Warren. The consensus loser: John Hickenlooper.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">I know that primaries always involve intraparty debates, but the Democrats really are fumbling their health care message. It should be easy for them: President Trump has repeatedly tried to take away people’s health insurance, while Democrats favor popular measures to increase coverage and reduce costs. But the party is engaged in a needless — and largely theoretical — debate about whether to expand Medicare gradually or radically. </p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">As <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/amyewalter/status/1156369254847062016" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Amy Walter</a> of the Cook Political Report tweeted: “A bunch of Ds — especially those who won in ’18 — are likely shaking their heads as they watched Dem candidates for POTUS debate health care for almost an hour w/out spending any time on Trump/GOP repeal of Obamacare &amp; pre-existing condition protection.”</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">The CNN moderators seemed more focused on encouraging feuding among the candidates than illuminating their policy positions, as Bloomberg’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-07-31/democratic-debate-cnn-steals-the-show-and-everyone-loses" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Jonathan Bernstein</a> noted.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">“So far, the big picture on the debate is the leading Democrats will criminalize private health insurance and decriminalize unauthorized border crossing. It’s a very different theory of the electorate than Democrats deployed in 08 or 12 or 18,” <!-- -->Vox’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/1156368039547265024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Ezra Klein</a> said on Twitter<!-- -->, after the start of the debate.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Klein’s colleague <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/30/20748020/democratic-debate-biden-warren-sanders" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Matt Yglesias</a> made a similar point: “If you stop and think about it for a minute, there is probably some wisdom to be gained from the reality that the biggest proponents of progressive policies on the stage hold safe blue Senate seats from New England while the former governors of Montana and Colorado are skeptical.”</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/KirstenPowers/status/1156400112131874823" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Kirsten Powers</a>, USA Today: “Moderates need to up their game.
