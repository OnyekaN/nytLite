Children who were taken from their parents, or who crossed the border alone, also go to their immigration hearings alone. And “alone” means no lawyer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many Americans are shocked that there is no right to a lawyer in immigration court. Last week, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/opinion/facing-the-injustice-of-immigration-court.html?searchResultPosition=2&amp;module=inline" title="">Mazin Sidahmed</a> wrote about New York City’s attempt to provide lawyers to immigrant families. If a lawyer matters to an adult — and it really, really does — it’s even more important for a child.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is not just a Trump-era problem. In 2012, Lenni Benson, a professor at New York Law School, started visiting immigration courts for a report she was writing on how to improve them. In one courtroom, the judge was hearing the cases of children. “There was a little boy at the table white-knuckling the chair, with no one to help him,” she said. He was about eight. His mother, who was undocumented, was afraid to come into the building.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Professor Benson, who knew the judge, asked if she could act as a friend of the court. She said that the judge and the attorney for the government — whose job it was to try to get the boy deported — were both relieved. After talking to the boy through an interpreter, she asked the judge to postpone his case until she could get him a lawyer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She went across the street to the boy’s mother. Then she called some of her former students, and got one to take the boy’s case for no pay.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What started as a collection of Professor Benson’s alumni is now the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.safepassageproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Safe Passage Project</a>, which has provided nearly 1,000 unaccompanied children with a lawyer — the most of any organization in the city, the group claims. It’s one of various nongovernmental organizations, many of which rely on volunteers, that are helping children get their cases heard.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Eight is not a typical age for an unaccompanied child. I talked to one young man in the Los Angeles area, Nolberto, who came from Guatemala alone at 14. The MS-13 gang had targeted him because he was a devout Christian and refused to sell drugs. The relatives he lived with needed to get him out in a hurry, and hired<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>someone to take him to the United States.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nolberto’s story is very common. Rich Leimsider, the executive director of Safe Passage, does not like the distinction many people make between innocent young children and menacing-looking teens. “We’re representing plenty of boys people would cross the street to avoid,” he said. “They still deserve a lawyer.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet there are also preteen children, some even younger than eight, in court alone. They’re there because the administration is still separating families; children taken from their families at the border are then deemed to be unaccompanied. On July 25, I saw children as young as 10 in court with no adult.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When a child crosses alone, or is separated from parents, he or she is held alone by the Border Patrol, often in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://apnews.com/46da2dbe04f54adbb875cfbc06bbc615?utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">inhumane conditions</a>. Legally, this detention is supposed to last no more than 72 hours, but in reality it can last several weeks.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Border agents then turn the child over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (part of the Department of Health and Human Services), which sends the child to its next open bed, anywhere in the country. That can be a foster family, small group home or institution.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then the refugee agency searches for a relative or friend who will take in the child and be designated a sponsor. About a third of children in the refugee agency’s care have no sponsor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> Some have been taken from their parents. Last year a judge ordered the Trump administration to reunite families, but there is no real tracking system. And the government <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/opinion/family-separation-trump-migrants.html?module=inline" title="">continues to separate families</a>. Anthony Enriquez, who runs the unaccompanied minors program at Catholic Charities in New York, said that last summer, the New York area received 400 children at the height of the crisis — and since then, 300 more have come.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other children have relatives who are afraid to come forward for fear they will be deported. Sponsors are becoming harder to find; without one, some children will stay in detention for the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/thousands-of-unaccompanied-migrant-children-could-be-detained-indefinitely/?utm_source=The+Marshall+Project+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=a59e97d062-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_07_25_11_58&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_5e02cdad9d-a59e97d062-174438081" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">rest of their childhood</a>. (Although many American families would like to take in such children, a sponsor must have a pre-existing relationship with the child.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nolberto’s case shows how much a lawyer can matter. He lived in Mixco, just outside Guatemala City, in a neighborhood controlled by MS-13. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His uncle was the pastor of a small evangelical church that met in the house where Nolberto lived. Nolberto loved the church. He joined a troop of children who performed Christian skits for the neighborhood and uploaded them on YouTube. Even before he was 10, he preached to other children and asked them not to join a gang.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">MS-13 tormented the congregation and repeatedly threatened to kill Nolberto if he didn’t sell drugs for them. (Is it any wonder <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/opinion/asylum-trump-guatemala-honduras.html?module=inline" title="">people want to leave</a>? Yet the Trump administration recently designated Guatemala a “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/world/americas/guatemala-safe-third-asylum.html?module=inline" title="">safe third country</a>,” meaning that any immigrant to the United States who passed through Guatemala must seek asylum there first. The administration is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-guatemala-mcaleenan/after-guatemala-u-s-seeks-migration-deals-with-honduras-el-salvador-idUSKCN1UR5BW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">pursuing similar arrangements</a> with Honduras and El Salvador.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Nolberto was 14, his family realized they had to get him out. They paid a member of the congregation to take him to the boy’s father, who lived — undocumented — in the Los Angeles area. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Along the route, Nolberto’s story became even more of a nightmare. The man hired by his uncle turned him over to another. Nolberto said in a phone interview that he was twice kidnapped for weeks and his father was extorted for money — once in Mexico and once in Texas.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Four months after leaving Guatemala, Nolberto reached his frantic father. In California, he went to high school and attended church without fear for the first time.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was given a court date and a list of groups that provide free lawyers. He called down the list and finally got one through <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://supportkind.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Kids In Need of Defense</a> (KIND), a national organization that has trained and supports some 40,000 pro bono lawyers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I would have gone to court by myself,” Nolberto said. “But I didn’t know what to apply for, how to make a case, or how to present it to the court.” Even after all he’d been through, the thought was terrifying. “They’re going to define if you stay or go home, and you could die at home,” he said. “Imagine if you don’t have help.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">KIND connected him to Linda Dakin-Grimm, a volunteer who was a corporate trial lawyer at Milbank, a large firm, in her day job.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is difficult for anyone to recount the story of the worst thing that he or she has ever experienced, and that is particularly so for a child, especially one likely to be traumatized. “It can take a long time to get their story, information relevant to their claim,” said Kennji Kizuka, a senior research and policy analyst for refugee protection at Human Rights First. “Building up that trust is difficult.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Dakin-Grimm said that Nolberto didn’t even mention his religion in their first few meetings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unaccompanied children can win residency in several ways. Many apply for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, which requires filing a lawsuit in state court.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The other major avenue is the famous one: asking for asylum.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Most people have the idea that it’s enough if I just tell you my tale of woe: ‘I come from a really, really, dangerous place and I was suffering a lot.’ It just doesn’t work that way,” Ms. Dakin-Grimm said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To get asylum, you must show you were persecuted because you were a member of a specific group, such as a religious group. And you have to show that the government you have fled can’t or won’t do its job to protect you.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Dakin-Grimm argued that Nolberto was persecuted because of his religious affiliation, and that the state did nothing. His uncle, the pastor, testified that threats against the church were so constant and terrifying that he had a stroke. Nolberto’s family also produced copies of letters they had written to the police requesting help — which never came. Ms. Dakin-Grimm supervised a group of Milbank lawyers who gathered evidence that nowhere in Guatemala was safe for him.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In March 2016, Nolberto won asylum. He has just graduated from high school and is about to take the entrance exam for the United States Marines.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Without a lawyer, even children with a good case get sent back. With a lawyer, they don’t. The Transactions Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://trac.syr.edu/phptools/immigration/juvenile/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">tracks immigration cases nationwide</a>. Since 2005 in New York, 87 percent of unaccompanied children without a lawyer were deported, while only 24 percent of children with lawyers were.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Dakin-Grimm has led teams representing 60 children, only two of whom were deported.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In some cities, including Los Angeles and New York, nongovernmental organizations (with some funding from the city, and the support of immigration judges) have been able to knit together a minimal safety net for unaccompanied children. At New York’s immigration court in downtown Manhattan, which handles cases from 13 counties, throngs of people line the halls, and lawyers approach them to offer free representation. Many organizations in New York City provide volunteer lawyers, among them Safe Passage, the Legal Aid Society, Human Rights First, The Door, KIND and Catholic Charities. They share a calendar; each group gets a day.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I sat in on four courtrooms. The judges were courteous (one held court via video), and tried to explain the process and put the children at ease. “How is your summer going?” Judge Evalyn Douchy asked one girl. Children without lawyers were given a list of organizations that can provide them and were told to come back in three months with one.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nationally, only about 40 percent of minors have counsel. Even in New York, counsel is short — Safe Passage, for example, has 400 volunteer lawyers and is desperately looking for 240 more.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Trump administration has been boundlessly creative in interpreting immigration rules to make life harder for child migrants, and migrants in general. But the system’s horrors run deeper. “It’s a misconception that this is a Donald Trump problem, that everything was fine before he got here and will be fine once he leaves,” said Mr. Enriquez, from Catholic Charities. “Deplorable treatment of minors is a longstanding issue with the border patrol and immigration officials in general.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The safety net for these children (such as it is) is sustained by the legal equivalent of a bake sale. The system has life-or-death power over children. Yet it provides a modicum of fairness only by the grace of tens of thousands of volunteers. “If you’re like me, you can’t sit by,” Professor Benson said. “This is America.”</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Tina Rosenberg won a Pulitzer Prize for her book “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780679744993" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Haunted Land: Facing Europe’s Ghosts After Communism</a>.” She is a former editorial writer for The Times and the author, most recently, of “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Join-the-Club/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Join the Club: How Peer Pressure Can Transform the World</a>” and the World War II spy story e-book “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16124470-d-for-deception/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">D for Deception</a>.”</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">To receive email alerts for Fixes columns, sign up </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://eepurl.com/ABIxL" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">here.</em></a></p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
