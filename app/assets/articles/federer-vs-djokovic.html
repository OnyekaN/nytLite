<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As Novak Djokovic steeled himself again to face Roger Federer and the crowd, Djokovic tried to imagine all the scenarios that could come to pass on Centre Court.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But men’s singles finals at Wimbledon have a way of surpassing everyone’s expectations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Add Sunday’s tightly wound classic to the list as Djokovic defeated Federer, 7-6 (5), 1-6, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 13-12 (3).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Thank you very much for staying all the way to the end,” Djokovic, the No. 1 seed and defending champion, said to Prince William and Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge as he clutched the trophy with his 4-year-old son, Stefan, by his side.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was Djokovic’s fifth Wimbledon singles title, and he secured it by saving two match points on the 37-year-old Federer’s serve and then prevailing in the fifth-set tiebreaker at 12-12, the first of its kind in a Wimbledon final.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I thought most of the match I was on the back foot,” Djokovic said. “I was defending. He was dictating the play. I just tried to fight and find a way when it mattered the most, which is what happened.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After breaking Djokovic at 7-7 in the fifth with a forehand passing shot, Federer served for the championship at 8-7 and took a 40-15 lead with two consecutive aces. Federer was one point away from winning his ninth Wimbledon singles title and becoming the oldest man to win a major singles title in the Open era.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The vast majority of the crowd appeared to want that outcome nearly as much as Federer did. Numerous spectators in Centre Court pointed skyward with their index finger in anticipation of that final point (while holding their drinks in the other hand).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Djokovic, long accustomed to Federer being a crowd darling, had other plans — and the skills and nerves to make them<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>a reality.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the first match point, Federer missed an inside-out<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>forehand after a deep second-serve return. On the second match point, Federer decided to hit a topspin forehand and rush the net. Federer has hit much more convincing approach shots in his life, and Djokovic capitalized by coolly flicking a forehand passing shot winner crosscourt.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was deuce, and two points later after two Federer forehand errors on the move, Djokovic completed the break of serve and evened the fifth set at 8-8.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer’s best chance for victory was gone, even if the match and the tension were far from finished as Djokovic had to boldly save two final break points at 11-11 at the net before getting into the final tiebreaker.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked later where it went wrong, Federer answered glumly, his baritone voice a little lower than usual.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“One shot I guess,” he said, referring to the match points. “Don’t know which one to pick. Your choice.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was one of the biggest tennis mood swings imaginable for Federer, who also lost to Kevin Anderson in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon last year after holding a match point.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beating Djokovic to win Wimbledon at age 37 after having defeated his other greatest rival, Rafael Nadal, in the semifinals, could have been considered the greatest achievement of Federer’s career.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But on the brink of elation, his moment pivoted to deflation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I just feel like it’s such an incredible opportunity missed, I can’t believe it,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Djokovic has had other great escapes against Federer: saving two match points in the semifinals at the United States Open in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/sports/tennis/12men.html?module=inline" title="">2010</a> and in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/sports/tennis/2011-US-Open-semifinals-djokovic-federer-nadal-murray.html?module=inline" title="">2011</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But neither of those occasions had the historical heft of Sunday’s final, although Djokovic said he did draw strength from the memories.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was kind of a flashback,” he said. “But look, in those kind of moments, I just try to never lose self-belief, just stay calm, just focus on trying to get the ball back, return, which wasn’t serving me very well today.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still he scrapped and improvised like a champion: rebounding from a 3-5 deficit in the first-set tiebreaker, diving to hit a volley winner at 5-5 in the fifth set and absorbing Federer’s pace and taking big risks of his own. Djokovic did it all with the crowd against him, and he coped by imagining that they were chanting “Novak” instead of “Roger,” just as he had when he won the 2015 U.S. Open over Federer and an even-more partisan crowd.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the stakes and their edgy rivalry, Federer and Djokovic showed surprisingly little emotion on Sunday, often avoiding eye contact. Djokovic did get a code-of-conduct violation for striking an on-court microphone with his racket late in the match. But poker faces, not howls or shouts, were much more the rule, as if both knew they needed to channel all their energy into the points themselves.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fifth-set tiebreaker was introduced by Wimbledon this year to avoid ultramarathon matches, like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/sports/wimbledon-anderson-isner-nadal-djokovic.html?module=inline" title="">the 26-24 fifth set</a> between Kevin Anderson and John Isner in the semifinals last year. But this was still the longest men’s final in the tournament’s history at 4 hours 57 minutes. The fifth set alone lasted 2 hours 2 minutes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Djokovic had to fight even longer to defeat Nadal in the 2012 Australian Open final: a five-set match that lasted 5:53. But he said Sunday’s duel with Federer was probably “the most mentally demanding match” of his career.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fifth-set tiebreaker rule was so new that Djokovic was actually confused about the timing, asking the chair umpire, Damian Steiner, deep into the fifth set it if would happen at 10-10.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But when it finally did arrive, at 12-12, Djokovic was well prepared to peak, just as he had in tiebreakers all afternoon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer was the more consistently brilliant and aggressive player over all. He hit 25 aces and finished with 94 winners and made 61 unforced errors. Djokovic finished with 54 winners and 52 unforced errors and struggled with his rhythm in the second set, which he lost in only 25 minutes. He didn’t break Federer’s serve until the fourth set, nearly three hours into the match.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the essential in tennis is winning the most important points. Djokovic is the first man to win a men’s singles final at Wimbledon after saving match point since 1948, when Robert Falkenburg of the United States came back to defeat John Bromwich of Australia after saving three match points.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer, who will turn 38 next month, remains a beloved champion worldwide and is having another excellent season. He has won more tour singles matches than any man in 2019.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Djokovic continues to have his number. Sunday’s victory was his fifth straight over Federer and also his fifth straight in Grand Slam play. The last time Federer defeated Djokovic in one of the four major tournaments was in the semifinals of Wimbledon in 2012.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since then, Djokovic has been able to resist Federer’s quick-strike skills and defeat him in three Wimbledon finals: <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/sports/tennis/Wimbledon-2014-novak-djokovic-defeats-roger-federer-for-title.html?module=inline" title="">2014</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/sports/tennis/wimbledon-2015-novak-djokovic-wins-wimbledon-title-beating-roger-federer.html?module=inline" title="">2015</a> and now 2019.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer has experienced no shortage of joy at the All England Club since he arrived as a junior and won the boys title in 1998. But he has now played three classic finals at Wimbledon and lost two of them. Nadal defeated him, 9-7, in the fifth set in 2008 in a match that finished in fading light and was widely acclaimed as one of the best in tennis history. In 2009, Federer bounced back by winning a serving duel with Andy Roddick, prevailing by 16-14 in the fifth set.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked to compare this Wimbledon final to 2008, he saw parallels, too many parallels.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This one is more straightforward maybe in some ways because we didn’t have the rain delays, we didn’t have the night coming in and all that stuff,” he said. “But sure, epic ending, so close, so many moments. I mean, sure there’s similarities. But you’ve got to go dig, see what they are. I’m the loser both times, so that’s the only similarity I see.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Djokovic, 32, was in a midcareer funk as recently as the spring of 2018, struggling for consistency and motivation and still finding his form after minor elbow surgery.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he has now won four of the last five Grand Slam singles titles, running his career total to 16. He is two behind Nadal’s 18 and four behind Federer’s men’s record of 20.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sunday’s victory may end up weighing heavily in the final margins between the Big Three when all have finished their careers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It seems like I’m getting closer, but they’re also winning Slams,” Djokovic said. “We’re kind of complementing each other. We’re making each other grow and evolve and still be in this game. I think those two guys are probably one of the biggest reasons I still compete at this level. The fact that they made the history of this sport motivates me as well, inspires me to try to do what they have done, what they’ve achieved, and even more.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Big Three have won the last 11 major singles titles, with Djokovic now taking the lead. His only loss in the last five Grand Slam tournaments came in a wind-swept semifinal at the French Open last month, when Dominic Thiem <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/08/sports/french-open-novak-djokovic-dominic-thiem.html?module=inline" title="">defeated him in five sets</a> over two days.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If not for that narrow defeat, the tennis world might not just be talking about Djokovic’s fifth Wimbledon singles title and one of tennis’s best major finals, but also about him chasing a true Grand Slam.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | DJOKOVIC WINS, 13-12</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When the chair umpire Damian Steiner announced the tiebreaker at 12-12, the crowd murmured in excited approval. Djokovic gained a minibreak advantage on the third point, when Federer misjudged a forehand half-volley and sent it wide. Djokovic extended his lead to 4-1, but went crashing down to the ground a point later as he tried to scramble for a Federer drop shot. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Djokovic kept his minibreak advantage, however, as the tiebreaker held on serve, and he extended his lead to 6-3 with a blazing backhand down the line.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That gave him three championship points after saving two from Federer at 8-7 in the fifth set.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first championship point was replayed after a successful challenge from Djokovic; on the redo, Djokovic converted immediately, with Federer shanking a forehand drive high into the air, ending the match.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a warm greeting at the net, after 4 hours 57 minutes, Djokovic knelt down, picked and ate some of the grass. He had his 16th Grand Slam title and fifth at Wimbledon.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | DJOKOVIC 12, FEDERER 12</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the first time in a singles qualifying or main-draw match, there will be a tiebreaker played at 12-12 in the final set, after Federer held at love in the 24th and final regular game of the match.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There were none required in the first 253 singles matches of the main draw; now one will decide the men’s champion.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | DJOKOVIC 11, FEDERER 11</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a marathon men’s semifinal last year in which Kevin Anderson <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/sports/wimbledon-anderson-isner-nadal-djokovic.html?module=inline" title="">beat John Isner, 26-24</a>, in the fifth set, Wimbledon added a new tiebreaker at 12-12 in the final set of matches for this year’s tournament. It was meant to provide a more definite finish time for previously interminable matches (Isner also once won a fifth set, 70-68).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Through 255 singles matches at Wimbledon this year, none have reached 12-12. Could the men’s final, now locked at 11-11 between Federer and Djokovic, be the first?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If they split the next two games, they will play a standard tiebreaker (first to seven points, win-by-two) to decide a champion.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | DJOKOVIC 10, FEDERER 10</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At 4 hours 28 minutes so far, this is the longest singles match of the tournament, passing Matteo Berrettini’s 4-hour, 19-minute victory over Diego Schwartzman in the third round.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer, in turn, then needed only 1 hour and 14 minutes to beat Berrettini in the fourth round.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | FEDERER 8, DJOKOVIC 8</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Serving for his ninth Wimbledon title up by 8-7 in the fifth, Federer opened with a forehand unforced error that landed far beyond the baseline, but which he challenged anyhow, out of apparent irritation. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After winning a nine-shot rally to level at 15-15, he hit two aces to give himself two championship points. The first one resulted in a strong forehand return from Djokovic, which jammed Federer into a forehand error. Djokovic saved the second championship point as well, hitting a forehand passing shot after a tentative Federer approach.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Djokovic then earned a break point by hitting a deep crosscourt forehand that Federer could not send back, and then drew another forced error on Federer’s forehand to level at 8-8.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | FEDERER 8, DJOKOVIC 7</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two loose forehands from Djokovic gave Federer his first break point in four return games, and he casually converted it with a forehand passing shot winner, breaking Djokovic for the seventh time.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This one, of course, was the most crucial of them all: Federer will now serve for a 21st Grand Slam title, up by 8-7 in the fifth set.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | Djokovic 6, FEDERER 6</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After 3 hours 57 minutes, the players are at 6-6 in the fifth set.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Neither has had a championship point yet, but Djokovic was a point away from earning such an opportunity four times during Federer’s last game.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer is playing in win-by-two territory in the fifth set of a Wimbledon final for the third time in his career, having lost to Rafael Nadal, 9-7, in 2008 but winning over Andy Roddick, 16-14, in 2009.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The four Grand Slams have four different ways to settle final sets now. That led Djokovic to ask the chair umpire Damian Steiner: “When is the tiebreak? 10-all?” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Should it be needed, it will be at 12-12, still a dozen games away.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | Djokovic 5, FEDERER 4</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer consolidated his break, holding for 4-4 in the fifth set, and opened up his next return game with a super backhand drop shot winner. Djokovic regained control, however, and despite another winning Federer drop shot, held for 5-4 to put himself one game from the title.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These two are now in win-by-two territory, but the 16-14 score line by which Federer won a fifth set against Andy Roddick in the final 10 years ago will not be possible: this year, Wimbledon has instituted a fifth-set tiebreaker to be played if the score remains deadlocked at 12-12.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | Djokovic 4, FEDERER 3</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a fifth set that has seemed more about nerves than sparkling tennis, Federer got proceedings back on serve, 4-3.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At 15-30, Federer had a good look at a forehand down the line but shoved it long, leveling the game. After Djokovic double-faulted on the next point to give Federer a break point, Federer again missed a forehand long, an unforced error.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer pounced a point later, closing out a 20-shot rally with a forehand winner. On the next point, the second break point of the game, it was Djokovic’s turn to miss a forehand long.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Centre Court crowd, ardently behind Federer the whole match, broke into chants of “Roger! Roger!” during the ensuing changeover.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | Djokovic 4, FEDERER 2</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Djokovic return game has awakened, and the defending champion is within reach of another title.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On his second break point of the sixth game in the final set, Djokovic awkwardly hit a short backhand that drew Federer forward, then unleashed on his next backhand, delivering a passing shot winner to take a 4-2 lead.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Djokovic has still won 10 fewer points overall than Federer, but he is just two games from the title.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Fifth set | Federer 2, Djokovic 2</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Djokovic did not earn a break point in this final until deep into the fourth set, but quickly found a pair of opportunities in the fourth game of the final set, going up, 15-40, on Federer’s serve.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer saved the first with a second serve that jammed Djokovic’s backhand. He saved the second with an inside-out forehand into Djokovic’s backhand, which <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/sports/tennis/djokovic-bends-and-twists-but-doesnt-break.html?module=inline" title="">the flexible Serb</a> could not retrieve.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two points later, Federer saved a third break point with an 123 m.p.h. ace that tagged the far sideline. He then held with another strong serve wide into Djokovic’s backhand, which Djokovic sent back but short enough for Federer to swiftly end the point with a forehand into the open court, leveling the final frame at 2-2.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">FOURTH set | FEDERER WINS, 6-4</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After dropping serve for the first time, Federer didn’t blink with a second chance to close out the fourth set, which he did without losing a point. He finished with a flourish with a forehand volley at net.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer left the court to change before the fifth set; Djokovic remained, snacking on energizing dates.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer has been the better player Sunday by raw numbers, winning 15 more total points so far, but Djokovic has won all three previous five-setters between the two: the U.S. Open semifinals in 2010 and 2011, and the 2014 Wimbledon final.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">FOURTH set | FEDERER 5, Djokovic 4</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After 2 hours 47 minutes, Djokovic finally earned his first break point of the match with Federer serving for the fourth set at 5-2. The opportunity led to the best rally of the match so far, a 35-shot exchange that ended with a Federer backhand winner. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Djokovic earned another opportunity two points later, however, and converted it for his first break of the match. He then consolidated that break. Federer will serve to force a fifth set for a second time, up 5-4.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">FOURTH set | FEDERER 5, Djokovic 2</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the second time Sunday, Federer has torn a set wide open, winning four straight games to race to a commanding, double-break lead of 5-2 in the fourth set. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer, who has still not faced a single break point on his serve, has converted five of eight break-point opportunities on his return, and will serve to force a fifth set.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That Federer is still behind in the overall score is a testament to Djokovic’s grit and a demonstration of the idiosyncratic tennis scoring system, given that he has won 16 more points overall.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">FOURTH set | FEDERER 4, Djokovic 2</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer has not faced a single break point on his serve against the player considered the game’s best returner. And he broke Djokovic’s serve for the fourth time, going up by 3-2 in the fourth set. He then held at love to make it 4-2.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite this big advantage in breaks, Federer still has considerable work to do in this match, which he trails two sets to one, despite having won 10 more total points.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Third set | Djokovic WINS, 7-6 </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After playing from behind and struggling to stay level through the third set, Djokovic surged ahead in the tiebreaker — with considerable help from Federer’s backhand. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer hit three unforced backhand errors in the first five points, helping Djokovic to a 4-1 lead. Djokovic extended that lead to 5-1 by winning a 23-shot rally that ended with another error, this one forced, from Federer’s backhand.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer cut his deficit to 4-5 with an ace, but then a squibbed backhand drop shot error gave Djokovic his first set point, which he converted by hitting an unreturnable deep shot to Federer’s forehand corner.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Djokovic leads two sets to one, and is one set from a 16th Grand Slam title, his fifth at Wimbledon.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Third set | FEDERER 6, Djokovic 6 </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like the first set, the third set of this men’s final will be determined by a tiebreaker, after 12 straight holds of serve.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Also like the first set, there was only one break point in the third set, which Djokovic saved.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer won four more total points than Djokovic in the third set heading into the tiebreaker, and 13 more in the match.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Third set | FEDERER 5, Djokovic 5 </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first break point of the third set was also a set point for Federer, earned with a deep forehand followed by a backhand half-volley winner.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Down by 30-40, Djokovic hit a strong, deep serve that kicked off the service line and forced Federer into a backhand error. Another strong serve gave Djokovic game point and a running backhand that Federer netted his reply to level the score of the third set at 5-5.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Third set | FEDERER 5, Djokovic 4 </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Neither player has earned a break point through the first nine games. Federer is making far more inroads on return than Djokovic in the match. He has made 83 percent of returns, compared with just 59 percent for Djokovic, and has earned five break points to Djokovic’s zero.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Third set | FEDERER 2, Djokovic 2 </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a shaky second set, Djokovic has kept proceedings on serve to 2-2. Djokovic on Friday won the longest rally (45 shots) at Wimbledon since it started tracking rally length in 2005. He also won the longest rally of this match so far, 21 shots, to go up by 40-15 in the fourth game.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One category where Djokovic is less superlative is his serve: his five aces are canceled out by five double faults.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">SECOND set | FEDERER WINS, 6-1</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After losing a hard-fought first set, Federer won the second set with considerable ease, taking it by 6-1 in just 25 minutes. He broke Djokovic’s serve three times. Djokovic had an impressive 14 winners against six unforced errors in the first set, but imploded in the second, hitting just two winners against 10 unforced errors. He finished the set by dropping his serve to love, including a double fault. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer knows, however, that a 6-1 second set does not necessarily indicate a winner. He lost the second set to Nadal <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/sports/tennis/federer-vs-nadal.html?module=inline" title="">in his semifinal on Friday</a> by the same score, only to come back and win the next two sets.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">SECOND set | FEDERER 5, Djokovic 1</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Federer won 15 of the first 19 points in the second set, though Djokovic got on the board with a hold for 1-4. There had been only one 6-0 “bagel” set between the two in their 47 previous matches: the first set the 2012 Cincinnati Masters, won by Federer.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">SECOND set | FEDERER 3, Djokovic 0</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a lousy finish to the first-set tiebreaker, Federer surged ahead to start the second, breaking Djokovic’s serve for the first time.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Djokovic helped significantly, hitting two unforced errors and losing his footing on another point.
