<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Let us dive into the sea, beyond the colorful world of the sun. About 1,000 to 2,000 feet down, we’ll arrive at a place where only blue beams in sunlight can penetrate. This is the home of the swell shark and chain catshark. Look at them with your human, land-ready eyes, and all you’ll see are a couple of unimpressive fish, spotted in shades of brown, beige and gray.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But peer through a blue filter, more like the way these sharks see each other, and behold beaming beauties robed in fluorescent green spots.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Recently scientists discovered that these sharks see the world totally differently than we do. They’re mostly colorblind, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep24751" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">with eyes that can detect only the blue-green spectrum</a>. This means when the sharks appear to change color in the blue water, they’re almost projecting a secret code to other sharks: One pattern male, the other female — come and get it. But just how they take blue light from their dull environment and transform it into a neon sign has been a mystery.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a study <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(19)30244-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published Thursday in iScience</a>, researchers reveal the secret behind this magical transformation: Molecules inside their scales transform how shark skin interacts with light, bringing in blue photons, and sending out green. This improved understanding of these sharks’ luminous illusions may lead to improvements in scientific imaging, as the study of biofluorescence in other marine life already has.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This phenomenon is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083259" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">widespread</a>, and these sharks are among at least 200 marine species known to color their dim oceanic world through biofluorescence. But the molecules these shark species use are nothing like the painting tools scientists know the others to use.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think this is just yet another amazing feature of shark skin that we didn’t already know about — just adding to their list of superpowers,” said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.davidgruber.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">David Gruber</a>, a marine biologist at City University of New York and an author on the paper.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These aren’t the charismatic predators “that make it onto shark week,” he adds. “But if we look at them deeply, we’ll see that there are hidden secrets and beauty.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shark skin is weird, plated in toothlike scales called denticles. To find their hidden beauty, Dr. Gruber worked with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://crawfordlab.yale.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Jason Crawford</a>, a biochemist at Yale University, and other colleagues. Dr. Crawford helped determine what metabolic pathways, or sequences of chemical reactions inside cells, could explain the neon shark skin of the swell and catshark.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under the microscope, they noticed several types of dendrites that, depending on their size, emitted green light of varying intensities in response to blue light. Some dendrites focused the light, channeling it outward like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=fiber+optic+light&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHq6TInfLjAhUGpFkKHdJ6D_gQ_AUIESgC&amp;biw=1447&amp;bih=697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a kitschy fiber optic light display</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Examining the skin more closely, the team found a set of molecules that were derived from tryptophan, an amino acid important for sleep and mood in humans. These molecules also contained bromine, which changes how the molecules, and essentially the skin, interacts with light. Those in the light skin, for example, could turn blue light into green light, creating that neon beacon for the other sharks to see.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many fluorescent marine animals seem to have evolved their own techniques for transforming light. The most well-studied among them is the use of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9759496" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">green fluorescent protein</a>, which can make neon rainbows out of jellyfish, corals and other animals in shallower depths. But the sharks’ process was unlike any of these.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These small-molecule metabolites in the shark skin may have stuck around because it helps sharks recognize mates in dark blue places. But some also have known antibiotic properties, which may explain why the shark skin stays so clean around so much bacteria on the seafloor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, many questions remain: Why do these sharks fluoresce while other species that aren’t so different from these two don’t?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s all like a big mystery novel,” said Dr. Gruber. “I’m sure there are many more species of fluorescent sharks out there in the ocean that we have yet to encounter.”</p>
