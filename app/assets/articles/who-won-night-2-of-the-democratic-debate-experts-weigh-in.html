<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tuesday night’s debate belonged to the front-runners, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. But their counterparts on Wednesday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris, couldn’t quite replicate their dominance.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Neither did badly by any means: There was no doubt that Mr. Biden beat his lackluster performance from the first debate, and Ms. Harris held her own under a barrage of attacks, likely a product of her own strong showing last time. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Wednesday’s most memorable performance, the experts seemed to agree, came from Senator Cory Booker — although so many candidates scored at least some points that strategists questioned whether the polls would move much. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here is a sampling of responses from some of the people who know the stakes of debates best: veteran campaign strategists and consultants from both parties. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Booker went after Mr. Biden fiercely on criminal justice, hammering home Mr. Biden’s role in creating the policies he is now proposing to reverse. Mr. Biden, in turn, attacked Mr. Booker’s record as mayor of Newark, but the consensus among strategists was that Mr. Booker came out on top. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They also praised Mr. Booker’s argument, early in the debate, that the candidates should focus less on intraparty disagreements on health care and more on their actual opponent, President Trump. </p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“Biden fired back on @CoryBooker about Newark policing under his mayoral Administration. But Booker was faster on the draw and came out ahead on style points.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1156736452073611271" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">David Axelrod</a></strong>, former senior adviser to President Barack Obama</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“Strong closing statement by @CoryBooker. He has a knack for weaving together family history with his values. Also, his shout-out to the host city (Detroit) didn’t come across as pandering.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/LauraRBelin/status/1156757722760732672" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Laura Belin</a></strong>, Iowa political commentator</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“Think it’s pretty clear @CoryBooker has best night. Made his own case — and did it well.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/jmpalmieri/status/1156757109897342976" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Jennifer Palmieri</a></strong>, former spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There was little doubt on Wednesday that Mr. Biden was more prepared and more polished than in the first debate, when he took a drubbing from Ms. Harris. He came armed with opposition research on her and Mr. Booker, and generally appeared more confident than last time. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His performance was uneven at times — and as several commentators noted, he was the only candidate to abruptly cut himself off, sometimes midsentence, when the moderators signaled he was out of time — but he easily cleared the low bar set by his last appearance.</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“Excellent opening statement from @JoeBiden out of the gate. Rising above, focusing on Trump. General election attitude. It’s working.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/adrienneelrod/status/1156723423621656576" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Adrienne Elrod</a></strong>, former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“@JoeBiden finally played the card he should have played in the last debate when @KamalaHarris challenged him on race. @BarackObama vetted his record and nominated him for Vice President.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1156737264279523331" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Mr. Axelrod</a></strong></p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“Biden wobbling between strong moments — far better than Miami — and awkward stumbling.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/murphymike/status/1156734859022413829" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Mike Murphy</a></strong>, Republican consultant</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“Castro’s hit on Biden was a tough hit. But this is a different Biden from the one we saw in the first debate. In Miami, he looked rattled. Not tonight. He’s taking the hits and pushing back.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/MoElleithee/status/1156732106904604673" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Mo Elleithee</a></strong>, former spokesman for Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic National Committee</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Harris dominated the first debate from start to finish. That lifted her significantly in the polls, but it also meant that on Wednesday, she was as much a target as Mr. Biden. Where she had been on offense, she now found herself on defense. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, while she did not shine as much as last time, she held her own.</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“@KamalaHarris has been on defense all night. A stark difference from the first debate.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/PattiSolisDoyle/status/1156738980282535936" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Patti Solis Doyle</a></strong>, senior adviser to the 2008 Obama campaign</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“@KamalaHarris is getting a lot of incoming and she’s handling it all well. I do not get what people are seeing who think she is flustered or unsteady. Bizarre to me.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/jmpalmieri/status/1156729344313741314" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Ms. Palmieri</a></strong></p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“@KamalaHarris’s closing is chilling. Usually these statements are formulaic. Hers is so powerful. Trump as a predator will ring true to many Democrats.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/PaulBegala/status/1156757954856665088" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Paul Begala</a></strong>, former adviser to Bill Clinton</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Gillibrand may have had the most memorable line of the night, if not the most substantive: “The first thing that I’m going to do when I’m president,” she said, “is I’m going to Clorox the Oval Office.” She also brought the subjects of gender equality and sexual violence into a debate that had previously skirted them.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But on what she clearly hoped would be a defining moment — an attack on Mr. Biden for his opposition to an expanded child care credit in 1981 — the reviews were mixed. Some strategists loved it. But within the theater, the applause left little doubt that the audience was with Mr. Biden on this one.

Representative Tulsi Gabbard, in particular, attacked Ms. Harris on her prosecutorial record in a way other candidates had chosen not to or been unable to do. Andrew Yang and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington also had their moments.</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“@TulsiGabbard brought up all the points against @KamalaHarris that Internet commenters having been pointing out for several months. … If @JoeBiden could deliver a takedown as effectively as @TulsiGabbard just did, he’d be the nominee already.” — <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/1156739225137532928" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Frank Luntz</a></strong>, Republican pollster and consultant</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">“So Gabbard is the one who finally had the real courage to come for Kamala on her criminal justice record.
