<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">NEW ORLEANS — The advice to Zion Williamson came from Saints quarterback Drew Brees. It is passed from athlete to athlete here like an heirloom: “If you love the city of New Orleans, it will love you right back.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This city throws its arms open to new arrivals, sharing its music, its food, its rich culture. From its athletes it wants something in return: confirmation that they want to be here. Validation that New Orleans punches above its weight, that a small market can hold its own in the big leagues.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They like to see their athletes doing New Orleans type things — eating beignets, out on Bourbon Street,” said Saints tackle Terron Armstead.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As skilled as forward Anthony Davis was for the N.B.A.’s Pelicans, many fans say that he seemed to be in New Orleans but not of New Orleans. His protracted divorce from the team last season and his departure to seek championships in Los Angeles with LeBron James and the Lakers left many here feeling jilted, a hoops marriage vacated at the altar of competition and finance.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The local embrace is more hopeful for Williamson, 19, who arrived by unlikely chance via the No. 1 pick in the draft lottery and whose teenage charisma, explosive power and agile grace have made him the most anticipated N.B.A. rookie since James joined Cleveland out of high school in 2003.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the city will have to wait, after the team announced its beloved young star would miss six to eight weeks after undergoing surgery for a torn meniscus in his right knee. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the meantime, the team’s fans are likely to grow even fonder of Williamson in his absence, especially if New Orleans struggles in the early going.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cleverly, Williamson has associated himself with the sport that people care most about here — football — appearing at games involving the Saints, Tulane and Louisiana State. And he has developed a kind of bromance with Brees, the Super Bowl winner who gave him a framed jersey that said, “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/nfl/saints/2019/06/24/saints-quarterback-drew-brees-passes-torch-pelicans-zion-williamson/1549199001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">To Zion — Passing the torch to you!</a>” For this summer’s ESPY Awards, Brees dressed his three sons in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://thespun.com/nfl/photo-drew-brees-sons-zion-williamson-dressed-alike-at-espys" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">maroon tuxedos</a> almost identical to the one that Williamson wore.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Football’s imprimatur has been more than enough to persuade Pelicans fans. An estimated 10,000 showed up for a public practice. The team has sold more than 12,000 season-ticket packages, a franchise record. Its lone home preseason game drew an announced sellout of 17,954. There were empty seats but no vacant enthusiasm.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The only thing that would come close for me to what we’re experiencing with Zion would be David Robinson getting out of the Navy and coming to San Antonio,” said Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry, who was an assistant with the Spurs in the 1989-90 season.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New Orleans is not a place that expects perfection. It is patient and willing to grant second chances. It stuck by the Saints through 20 consecutive nonwinning seasons as an expansion franchise. But just as this city knows how to put out the welcome mat, it knows how to hold a grudge, even if playfully.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a referee’s blown pass-interference call during the N.F.C. championship game in January probably kept the Saints out of the Super Bowl, the town held a Boycott Bowl parade and concert. Less gleefully, a Saints fan filed a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/09/07/saints-rams-lawsuit-brought-by-fan-dismissed-by-louisiana-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">lawsuit</a> against the N.F.L. that reached the state supreme court in Louisiana before being dismissed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So when Davis asked to be traded, and then was after last season, it was no surprise that feelings were hurt. To hear fans tell it, it was not just that Davis left, but the way he left — wearing a “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/anthony-davis-defends-thats-all-folks-shirt-says-he-has-no-control-over-what-he-wears/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">That’s all folks!</a>” T-shirt to his final game in New Orleans.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We might be ‘the City that Care Forgot,’ but it’s not that we don’t care,” said Rick Sanchez, a Pelicans season-ticket holder. “You can’t leave us high and dry. You don’t want to be with us, we don’t want to be with you.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When New Orleans secured the first pick via the N.B.A. draft lottery in May, some in the media surmised that Williamson might try to return to Duke for his sophomore season. But his stepfather, Lee Anderson, felt a small Southern market could be a good fit for Williamson, who grew up in South Carolina, telling <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/it-turns-out-zion-williamson-is-happy-in-new-orleans-and-not-going-back-to-duke-151033889.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ESPN</a> in a radio interview, “We’re excited about the Crescent City down there in New Orleans.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two days after the draft in June, Williamson wrote on Twitter, “Dream is finally here, ready to get to work and give the City of New Orleans everything I got.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He kept his word during the preseason, muscling and whirling inside to hit <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27810136/zion-williamson-scores-game-high-29-points-win-vs-bulls" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">12 of 13</a> shots against the Chicago Bulls, then powering to the basket regularly against Rudy Gobert of Utah, the N.B.A.’s reigning two-time defensive player of the year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He’s kind of surprisingly agile; he takes a lot of people off guard because of that,” Gobert said. “He can change direction pretty quick.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As rookies inevitably do, Williamson needs to take a “big step” to improve his defense, Gentry said. But a feathery 3-pointer against Utah suggested that Williamson may be able to hit jump shots when he cannot get to the rim.<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There has been much discussion about whether Williamson could handle the wear and tear of an N.B.A. season while carrying 285 pounds on his 6-foot-6 inch frame. Days before the injury, Gentry said he was unconcerned.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He’s got 8 percent body fat; we should all be so lucky,” Gentry said. “We’re fine with where he is.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New Orleans is a predominantly black city known for transcendent African-American entertainers, but the sporting <!-- -->Mount Rushmore of New Orleans<!-- --> is considered by many fans and experts to only include whites: Brees, Saints Coach Sean Payton, the former Saints quarterback Archie Manning and the New Orleans Jazz star Pete Maravich. Perhaps Chris Paul deserves to be on this list, but feelings about him here have been complicated since he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in 2011 after saying he would not sign a contract extension with New Orleans. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some black fans said it was not important to have a transformative black athlete play in the city. Others said it was. “Anthony Davis had the potential, but he did not embrace New Orleans,” said Edgar Chase III, whose family’s restaurant, Dooky Chase, is a <!-- -->legendary<!-- --> exemplar of Creole cooking.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chase added: “Now I think Zion has the potential. He’s going about it from the beginning in the right way. He understands the people. He knows us so we can know him.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Brian Turner, the director of African-American and Diaspora Studies at Xavier University here, said it was encouraging to see Williamson interacting with the artist and activist known as Bmike and high school students, most of them black, who are designing an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2855855-pelicans-zion-williamson-to-wear-custom-air-jordan-xxxiv-designed-by-children" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Air Jordan shoe that Williamson will wear in a game</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Turner said he was curious to see whether Williamson, as he matures, develops a sense of social responsibility that could include opening a school as James did in Akron, Ohio, or supporting other initiatives that encourage young black men to further their education.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Does Zion run that pathway and have that impact in New Orleans? Who knows,” Turner said. “It would be very much welcomed.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Of course, academics and community leaders acknowledge, that is a lot to ask of a 19-year-old just beginning his professional career. But Williamson said that at some point, he could see himself addressing issues that are urgent in New Orleans in the post-Katrina era, like affordable housing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“At a certain age, when I’ve learned how to handle myself, of course, and manage my own stuff, yeah, I’m going to get into that a little bit,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For now, Chase said, it was more than enough for Williamson to excel at basketball.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Let the man enjoy his life,” he said. “New Orleans needing help will be New Orleans needing help 30 years from now. We’re not asking for his money — we’re asking for his talent, his commitment to the team, to the city. That’s all free. Win a championship, that’s what we want. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Our community is strong enough to develop its own structures of success, but we don’t have the innate talent to dunk a basketball or shoot a 3-pointer or block a shot that Zion has. We can find the other stuff. We can’t find you, Zion.”</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Jack Begg contributed research.</p>
