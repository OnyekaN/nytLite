<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">ELY, Minn. — In the waning months of the Obama administration, a Chilean conglomerate was losing a fight with the United States government over a copper mine that it wanted to build near a pristine wilderness area in Minnesota.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The election of President Trump, with his business-friendly bent, turned out to be a game-changer for the project.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beginning in the early weeks of Mr. Trump’s presidency, the administration worked at a high level to remove roadblocks to the proposed mine, government emails and calendars show, overruling concerns that it could harm the Boundary Waters, a vast landscape of federally protected lakes and forests along the border with Canada.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Executives with the mining company, Antofagasta, discussed the project with senior administration <!-- -->officials<!-- -->, including the White House’s top energy adviser, the emails show. Even before an interior secretary was appointed to the new administration, the department moved to <!-- -->re-examine leases critical to the <!-- -->mine<!-- -->, eventually <!-- -->restoring<!-- --> those that the Obama administration had declined to renew. <!-- -->And the Forest Service called off an environmental review that could have restricted mining, even though the agriculture secretary had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7YNTjM9LRM&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">told Congress</a> <!-- --> that the review would proceed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An Interior Department spokesman said it simply worked to rectify “a flawed decision rushed out the door” <!-- -->before Mr. Trump took office<!-- -->. Several <!-- -->senior<!-- --> department officials with previous administrations, however, said <!-- -->they were surprised by<!-- --> the swift change of course for the little-known Minnesota project, which<!-- --> was not a focal point of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the family of the billionaire Andrónico Luksic, which controls the Chilean conglomerate, the policy reversals could provide a big boost to its mining business<!-- -->. <!-- -->Since the change in administration, the<!-- --> Antofagasta <!-- -->subsidiary<!-- --> Twin Metals Minnesota<!-- --> has significantly ramped up its lobbying in Washington, according to federal disclosures, spending $900,000.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the mining project’s breakthrough, already unpopular with environmentalists, has drawn additional scrutiny and criticism because of an unusual connection between Mr. Luksic and two of Mr. Trump’s family members.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Just before Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Luksic <!-- -->added a <!-- -->personal<!-- --> investment to his portfolio<!-- -->: a $5.5 million house in Washington. Mr. Luksic bought the house with the intention of renting it to a wealthy new arrival to Mr. Trump’s Washington, according to Rodrigo Terré, chairman of Mr. Luksic’s family investment <!-- -->office<!-- -->, which handled the purchase. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The idea worked. Even before the purchase was final, real estate agents had lined up renters: Jared Kushner and Ivanka <!-- -->Trump<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The rental arrangement has been a point of concern for ethics experts and groups opposed to mining near the Boundary Waters, and has focused national attention, particularly among some <!-- -->Democrats<!-- --> in Congress, on an otherwise local debate. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Wall Street Journal <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ivanka-trumps-landlord-is-a-chilean-billionaire-suing-the-u-s-government-1489000307" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">first reported</a> about the house in March 2017. At that time, Twin Metals was suing the federal government over the mining leases, but the Trump administration’s direction on the mine <!-- -->since then <!-- -->had only begun to take shape<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent months, the scrutiny has grown. In March, Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat who is chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://naturalresources.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2019-3-1%20Grijalva%20to%20USDA%20and%20DOI%20on%20BWCAW.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">wrote a letter</a> with other lawmakers to the <!-- -->interior<!-- --> and agriculture secretaries raising significant concerns about the proposed mine.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The letter said the two departments’ actions “blatantly ignored scientific and economic evidence.” It also mentioned the “interesting coincidence” surrounding the rental of the Luksic house to Mr. Trump’s relatives. Separately, a group in Minnesota opposed to the mining, Save the Boundary Waters, has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.savetheboundarywaters.org/updates/campaign-statement-re-antofagasta-renting-house-ivanka-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">called the rental arrangement</a> “deeply troubling” and has seized on it to cast doubt on the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.savetheboundarywaters.org/updates/antofagasta-chilean-mining-giant-rushing-ruin-boundary-waters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">administration’s actions</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The White House and representatives for the couple declined to answer questions about whether the rental deal had been reviewed by ethics officials.<!-- --> “<!-- -->Both Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump follow the ethics advice they received when they entered government service,”<!-- --> <!-- -->said Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Terré called the lease a simple real estate transaction that happened to involve the incoming president’s family. “I do not believe there was anything unethical or inappropriate about this business transaction,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Both Mr. <!-- -->Mirijanian<!-- --> and Mr. Terré said the rental was not related to the Minnesota mine. “There is no correlation in any way,” Mr. Mirijanian <!-- -->said<!-- -->. They were “two entirely unrelated matters” and tying them together was “based on unfounded rumors and speculation,” Mr. Terré said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An Interior Department spokeswoman said that neither Mr. Kushner nor Ms. Trump been involved in discussions about the mine.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nonetheless, several ethics experts said they would have cautioned Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump against renting the home, given the Luksic family’s business before the administration.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There may be nothing wrong,” said Arthur Andrew Lopez, a federal government ethics official for two decades who is now a professor at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business. “But it doesn’t look good.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Boundary Waters hold a <!-- -->special<!-- --> place in American geography: More than a million acres of lakes and forests provide a rich habitat for thousands of species, including the<!-- --> <!-- -->gray wolf and Canada lynx. But below the surface<!-- --> and beyond <!-- -->l<!-- -->ies richness of another sort, an estimated <!-- -->four billion tons of copper <!-- -->and nickel ore — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.miningminnesota.com/duluth-complex/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">believed to be</a> one of the world’s largest undeveloped mineral deposits. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The mining giant controlled by the Luksic family, Antofagasta, <!-- -->took <!-- -->full control <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.twin-metals.com/about-the-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">of the project</a> in 2015,<!-- --> and its executives have called it the company’s “most advanced international opportunity.”<!-- --> <!-- -->Antofagasta, which is publicly traded in London, is poised to benefit from the growing use of copper in renewable-energy technologies like wind and solar. <!-- -->It<!-- --> lists<!-- --> Mr. Luksic as a <!-- -->board<!-- --> member, and <!-- -->his younger brother, Jean-Paul Luksic, as chairman<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company has spent <!-- -->more than $450 million<!-- --> so far on the project, run by <!-- -->the<!-- --> subsidiary, Twin Metals Minnesota<!-- -->. It says the project will generate hundreds of mining jobs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The promise of employment resonates in Minnesota’<!-- -->s<!-- --> <!-- -->Iron Range<!-- -->, which has <!-- -->lost a quarter of its mining jobs since 2000<!-- -->. “The mining industry brings a tsunami effect for the community with regard to jobs, schools, everything,” said <!-- -->Andrea Zupancich<!-- -->, the mayor of <!-- -->Babbitt<!-- -->, a town of <!-- -->1,500<!-- --> near the proposed mine. </p><p class="g-pstyle0">20 MILES</p><p class="g-pstyle1">CANADA</p><p class="g-pstyle2">BOUNDARY WATERS</p><p class="g-pstyle2">CANOE AREA</p><p class="g-pstyle2"> WILDERNESS</p><p class="g-pstyle3">Underground</p><p class="g-pstyle3">mining area</p><p class="g-pstyle4">Babbitt</p><p class="g-pstyle5">Lake</p><p class="g-pstyle5">Superior</p><p class="g-pstyle6">1</p><p class="g-pstyle7">MINNESOTA</p><p class="g-pstyle8">CANADA</p><p class="g-pstyle9">Area</p><p class="g-pstyle9">of detail</p><p class="g-pstyle8">N.D.</p><p class="g-pstyle10">MINN.</p><p class="g-pstyle6">53</p><p class="g-pstyle11">Duluth</p><p class="g-pstyle8">WIS.</p><p class="g-pstyle12">Minneapolis</p><p class="g-pstyle13">St. Paul</p><p class="g-pstyle8">S.D.</p><p class="g-pstyle14">WISCONSIN</p><p class="g-pstyle8">IOWA</p><p class="css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit" data-testid="credit" id="interactive-credit">By The New York Times</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Antofagasta’s environmental record, however, has raised concerns.

Mining, he concluded, risked “serious and irreplaceable harm to this unique, iconic, and irreplaceable wilderness.”<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Twin Metals called the analysis “riddled with errors” and said “environmental risks will be properly managed.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the fears have divided nearby residents. <!-- -->“In the summer, we drink out of this water,” said <!-- -->Susan Schurke<!-- -->, who runs <!-- -->Wintergreen Northern Wear<!-- -->, an outdoor clothing company. “Once that’s tainted, it’s over. How can we risk that?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When<!-- --> the Obama administration moved to block the project in 2016, Twin Metals sued. <!-- -->The company <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.twin-metals.com/twin-metals-files-lawsuit-to-protect-mineral-rights-in-northern-minnesota/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said in a statement</a> then<!-- --> that the administration’s move threatened jobs and would “hinder access to one of the world’s largest sources of copper, nickel and platinum <!-- -->— resources of strategic importance to the U.S. economy<!-- --> and national defense.<!-- -->” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Just as the mining company’s hopes appeared to be on the ropes, it got a welcome surprise: Mr. Trump’s election<!-- -->, and the promise of a pro-industry agenda.<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With a new administration on its way to Washington, Mr. Luksic contacted a <!-- -->real estate<!-- --> broker he knew for help with an investment idea: buying residential<!-- --> properties<!-- --> in Washington, including a luxury home, to rent out. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the help of the broker, Rodrigo Valderrama, <!-- -->Mr. Luksic’s <!-- -->family investment office<!-- -->, which through corporate entities owns a portfolio of real estate in the United <!-- -->States<!-- -->, bought two condominiums in the capital. One was never rented and later sold at a <!-- -->loss<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As for the luxury home, Mr. Valderrama spent weeks touring homes and alerting brokers that he had an interested client. One house he saw was <!-- -->on Tracy Place, in the Kalorama neighborhood, <!-- -->being handled by the real estate firm Washington Fine Properties. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner <!-- -->were using the same firm for their hunt for a house to rent.<!-- --> <!-- -->With Mr. Kushner’s parents tagging along, they saw the <!-- -->six-bedroom, 7,000-square-foot <!-- -->Kalorama home as well<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the space of a week, Mr. Luksic’s representatives agreed to buy the house and closed on the all-cash transaction, while their would-be tenants waited for the purchase to be complete. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">T<!-- -->he two sides, working through brokers, agreed on rent of $15,000 per month. <!-- -->Mr. Terré <!-- -->described it as being in the “high range” for the area, <!-- -->which <!-- -->some<!-- --> real estate agents confirmed. Still, t<!-- -->hat rent was significantly lower than what the couple had discussed paying for another more expensive house<!-- -->, according to interviews.<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Terré said both sides were aware of each others’ identities before the rental deal was finalized. “We disclosed our name and the name of my boss,” he said in a telephone interview. <!-- -->Mr. Mirijanian said the couple had decided to lease the home before knowing the landlord’s identity.

After Ms. Bachelet’s 2013 election, the bank approved the loan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A spokesman for Ms. Bachelet said an investigation into the meeting didn’t lead to any charges. Representatives for Mr. Luksic said <!-- -->that he never discussed the loan with Ms. Bachelet<!-- -->, and that regulators found “there was absolutely nothing irregular about the bank’s approval of the loan.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Trump administration’s efforts to smooth the way for Antofagasta’s mining ambitions began less than two weeks after the inauguration,<!-- --> when Interior Department officials began re-examining the leases, <!-- -->the government emails<!-- --> show. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The message from an early meeting, according to <!-- -->an attendee<!-- --> who spoke on condition of anonymity, was that officials should prepare for a change in direction<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials also made sure the incoming interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, not yet in the job, was briefed. <!-- -->In an email, one Interior Department official described that effort as a “fire drill.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The administration’s efforts are documented in part in thousands of pages of government emails and calendars, many obtained through records requests by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://lvgaldieri.com/prosperity-a-lake-superior-project/the-boundary-waters-reversal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Louis V. Galdieri</a>, a documentary filmmaker, and the Sierra Club, an environmental organization.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A key meeting occurred in early May, when Antofagasta’s chief executive, along with other executives and lobbyists, discussed the issue with the White House’s top adviser on <!-- -->domestic<!-- --> energy and the environment, Michael Catanzaro. The company said it wanted to reverse the Obama-era decisions, which it said were illegal and inflicted “undue damage.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The next month, Interior Department officials learned that the White House had “expressed interest in the Twin Metals matter,” according to an email sent by a department lawyer marked “TIME SENSITIVE.” <!-- -->Soon after, top interior appointees traveled to the Minnesota site.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That December, the department <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/uploads/m-37049.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reversed course</a> on denying the company’s leases, and<!-- --> Twin Metals withdrew its lawsuit.<!-- --> The Interior Department formally renewed the leases<!-- --> last month, <!-- -->with some restrictions. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Twin Metals scored another victory in <!-- -->September<!-- --> when the Forest Service cut short its mining-ban review. <!-- -->An agency <!-- -->spokesman<!-- --> said it had determined that neither the study nor a ban was needed. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A Twin Metals spokesman, David Ulrich, said the company’s outreach was part of a long-running effort to share its views with the federal government.
