<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/nyregion/daniel-pantaleo-fired.html?module=inline" title="">announced</a> that he was firing the police officer who had put Eric Garner in the chokehold that led to his death, New York City’s police commissioner, James O’Neill, sent the country’s largest police force a message: You may not think I’m on your side, but I am. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a former beat officer, Mr. O’Neill said the decision to fire Officer Daniel Pantaleo was difficult. “I’ve been a cop a long time,” he said at a midday news conference at Police Headquarters. “And if I was still a cop, I’d probably be mad at me — ‘You’re not looking out for us.’ But I am.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a powerful message from one of the most prominent law enforcement officials in the country: Police officers who violate the public trust must be held accountable, for the good of the public and the police force.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. O’Neill said he had determined that Mr. Pantaleo’s actions in the Garner case made him unfit to serve, despite a “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/ny-oneill-remarks-pantaleo-firing-20190819-codk7s4zavevlnz5fwegqvpd4i-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">commendable service record</a>” of nearly 300 arrests.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Garner’s <!-- -->fatal encounter with the police <!-- -->on a Staten Island street<!-- --> in 2014 helped to propel the Black Lives Matter movement, in which protesters across the country took to the streets demanding accountability in the killing of black Americans by police officers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New York police officers said Mr. Garner, 43, resisted when they tried to arrest him on charges of selling untaxed cigarettes. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But millions of Americans watched a video of Mr. Garner’s <!-- -->struggle <!-- -->with Mr. Pantaleo and saw something else: an unarmed man struggling for his life.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They saw Mr. Pantaleo’s arm wrapped tightly against Mr. Garner’s neck, a chokehold <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/nyregion/kelly-bans-choke-holds-by-officers.html?module=inline" title="">banned</a> by the Police Department in 1993. They heard Mr. Garner’s desperate cry for help as he <!-- -->pleaded<!-- -->, “I can’t breathe,” again and again until falling silent.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet, for five years, justice was elusive. In 2014, a Staten Island grand jury <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/nyregion/grand-jury-said-to-bring-no-charges-in-staten-island-chokehold-death-of-eric-garner.html?module=inline" title="">declined to indict</a> Mr. Pantaleo on criminal charges. Federal Justice Department officials in the Obama administration weighed civil rights charges for years but left the case mired in indecision. On July 16, one day before the five-year statute of limitations expired, Attorney General William Barr <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/nyregion/eric-garner-case-death-daniel-pantaleo.html?module=inline" title="">ordered the case be dropped</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All the while, Mr. Pantaleo continued to serve on the force, even seeing his overtime pay <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/09/officer-in-eric-garner-death-boosts-overtime-pay-105359" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">incr</a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/09/officer-in-eric-garner-death-boosts-overtime-pay-105359" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ease</a> in the year after Mr. Garner’s death.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The city’s police union responded to the commissioner’s decision on Monday with its own form of resistance. “We are urging all New York City police officers to proceed with the utmost caution in this new reality, in which they may be deemed ‘reckless’ just for doing their job,” the Police Benevolent Association president, Patrick Lynch, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/nyregion/daniel-pantaleo-fired.html?module=inline" title="">said in a statement</a>, appearing to call for a work slowdown. “We will uphold our oath, but we cannot and will not do so by needlessly jeopardizing our careers or personal safety.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s important that Mr. O’Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio brush off the bombast while continuing to give officers the support they need.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the past, <!-- -->New York has<!-- --> been too reluctant to discipline its police officers, with grave consequences. Particularly troubling is evidence suggesting that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/opinion/police-brutality-discipline-eric-garner.html?module=inline" title="">officers rarely face discipline</a> for using chokeholds, even though the move is banned. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Pantaleo had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/opinion/fire-pantaleo-eric-garner.html?module=inline" title="">four substantiated allegations of abuse</a> against him before he <!-- -->choked <!-- -->Mr. Garner — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/data-transparency-initiative-mos.page#complaint_sub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">far more</a> than a vast majority of members of the force. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Garner’s family has suffered immensely. His daughter <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/30/nyregion/erica-garner-dead.html?module=inline" title="">Erica Garner</a> died in 2017 of a heart attack after years of activism in the wake of her father’s death. Mr. Garner’s stepfather, Benjamin Carr, died of a heart attack last month. Mr. Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, has been tireless in seeking justice for her son. It is a small mercy, at least, that she has seen something approaching justice done.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The lack of accountability in Mr. Garner’s death has also remained an open wound in the city, adding to a sense of grievance against the police among black and Hispanic New Yorkers even as crime rates were falling to record lows.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. O’Neill seems to understand this. He said Monday that every time he sees the video of Mr. Garner, he wants to intervene to change the confrontation from turning tragic.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Every time I watched the video, I say to myself, as probably all of you do, to Mr. Garner, ‘Don’t do it, comply,’” he said. “To Officer Pantaleo, ‘Don’t do it.’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Mr. O’Neill said that Mr. Garner’s death “must have a consequence.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It must. And, after too many years, it finally has.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
