<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SAN JUAN, P.R. — The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/us/puerto-rico-protests-timeline.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline" title="">political crisis</a> that has paralyzed the government of Puerto Rico for the past three weeks deepened on Thursday and left the island’s 3.2 million residents increasingly unsure who will ultimately lead the territory.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A day of closed-door maneuvers among powerful political leaders failed to clearly determine who will succeed Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló, whose resignation will become effective on Friday afternoon. If a successor is not in place when the governor steps down — and that outcome was looking increasingly possible on Thursday — the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/puerto-rico-rossello-vazquez-succession.html?module=inline" title="">complicated question</a> could end up in court.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The latest round of high-stakes politicking took place inside the marble-lined halls of Puerto Rico’s Capitol in San Juan, where Mr. Rosselló <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/pedro-pierluisi-puerto-rico-governor.html?module=inline" title="">had convened a special session</a> to confirm <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/us/puerto-rico-governor-pedro-pierluisi.html?module=inline" title="">Pedro R. Pierluisi</a>, the island’s former nonvoting representative in Congress, as his successor. But some legislators from Mr. Rosselló’s ruling New Progressive Party, offended that he had not consulted them over Mr. Pierluisi’s nomination, had other plans.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thomas Rivera Schatz, the powerful president of Puerto Rico’s Senate, who wants to be governor himself, declared that Mr. Pierluisi did not have the votes to win confirmation as secretary of state, the next in line to succeed the governor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But instead of voting him down, Mr. Rivera Schatz unexpectedly offered to hold a confirmation hearing for Mr. Pierluisi — though not until Monday, three days after Mr. Rosselló’s resignation <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/us/rossello-puerto-rico-governor-resigns.html?module=inline" title="">is scheduled to take effect</a>. A Senate vote, in that case, might not take place until later next week.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Rivera Schatz’s proposal raised questions among lawmakers over who would take over after Mr. Rosselló resigns, and when.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You have kidnapped democracy in Puerto Rico!” said Senator Eduardo Bhatia of the opposition Popular Democratic Party.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The House of Representatives, which also must confirm the appointment, scheduled a hearing for Mr. Pierluisi for Friday morning and a vote on his nomination for Friday afternoon. If Mr. Pierluisi fails to win that vote, it would put an end to his nomination, said Carlos J. Méndez Núñez, the house speaker.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If he doesn’t have the votes tomorrow, he doesn’t have them,” he said. “Period.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Méndez Núñez said he did not know how his caucus would vote. Earlier, Representative Gabriel Rodríguez Aguiló, the House majority leader, said several New Progressive lawmakers had decided to support Mr. Pierluisi after speaking with him privately.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But if the Senate does not act until Monday, Mr. Pierluisi’s confirmation — and the succession — would remain in limbo when Mr. Rosselló leaves office at 5 p.m. even if Mr. Pierluisi wins a House vote on Friday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under that scenario, the person to be sworn in on Friday could be <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/us/puerto-rico-wanda-vasquez-governor.html?module=inline" title="">Wanda Vázquez, the secretary of justice</a>, who is third in the line of succession. She <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/wandavazquezg/status/1157019682823639040?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">wrote on Twitter</a> on Thursday that she would be ready to assume her constitutional duties, though she has made it clear that she is not otherwise interested in being governor. The possibility that she would become governor triggered a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/puerto-rico-march-vazquez-rossello.html?module=inline" title="">new round of street demonstrations</a> this week, with many protesters calling for her resignation because she is too close to Mr. Rosselló.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My resignation is not contemplated,” Ms. Vázquez wrote.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Complicating matters further is the fact that Mr. Pierluisi could also have a claim to the governor’s seat, even without being confirmed by the Legislative Assembly, because he took the oath as secretary of state late on Wednesday, as a recess appointment made by Mr. Rosselló.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There are two possible interpretations with two different results,” said Efrén Rivera Ramos, a law professor at the University of Puerto Rico. “In both cases, the door is left open for a possible lawsuit. No one imagined that Rivera Schatz was going to do what he did.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There could be further confusion next week: If Ms. Vázquez were to be sworn in and Mr. Pierluisi were to be confirmed afterward, it is unclear whether he would become Ms. Vázquez’s secretary of state or whether he would have a stronger claim that he should be governor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Rivera Schatz insisted that the process was orderly, though he acknowledged that critics might take their concerns to the Puerto Rico Supreme Court before 5 p.m. on Friday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is no constitutional crisis,” Mr. Rivera Schatz said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The chaotic scene inside the Capitol suggested otherwise. Lawmakers scattered as reporters chased them down, asking for explanations. Opposition lawmakers complained that the New Progressive Party, which supports statehood for Puerto Rico, had extended the uncertainty while its leaders fought an intraparty power struggle.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It furthers many people’s anxiety and desperation,” said Senator José Antonio Vargas Vidot, a political independent.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Political parties in Puerto Rico do not neatly match up with those nationally. They are split over Puerto Rico’s status — supporting statehood, independence or the island’s current status as a United States commonwealth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The drama peaked when Mr. Rivera Schatz took the microphone on the Senate floor. As he angrily denounced Mr. Rosselló and Mr. Pierluisi, Mr. Pierluisi entered the Senate gallery, creating a silent confrontation from the floor below to the gallery above.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Television cameras and reporters swarmed Mr. Pierluisi, who stood without addressing the chamber. “Let me listen,” he said. Mr. Rivera Schatz carried on without pausing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Local television and radio stations ran nonstop live coverage throughout the day. Several ran clocks counting down to Mr. Rosselló’s departure.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outside the Capitol, a small crowd of protesters waited for clarity early in the day. Some demanded a different nominee than Mr. Pierluisi, a lawyer whose firm — from which he took a leave of absence this week — works for the unpopular federal oversight board that manages Puerto Rico’s finances. Others maintained he was acceptable enough.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I didn’t vote for Pierluisi,” said Benjamín Ramos Román, a retiree from San Sebastián, P.R., who referred to Mr. Pierluisi’s 2016 candidacy for governor. “But I think they should name a governor. We have a serious constitutional problem. People are tired. They want peace and calm.”</p>
