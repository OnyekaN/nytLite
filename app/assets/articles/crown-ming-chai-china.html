<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SYDNEY, Australia — When Australian federal agents searched a private jet with high-stakes gamblers at a coastal resort airport in 2016, they were seeking proof of international money laundering. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They didn’t find enough evidence for an arrest, but on board they identified a <!-- -->businessman<!-- --> accused of ties to Chinese crime syndicates — and Ming Chai, an Australian citizen who turned out to be a close relative of China’s powerful top leader, Xi <!-- -->Jinping<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now Mr. Chai, a cousin of Mr. Xi’s, is part of a broad investigation into <!-- -->organized crime<!-- -->, money laundering and immigration abuse that has raised national security concerns and shaken Australian politics. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It has also crystallized concerns within Australia about a global nexus of crime, ultrawealthy individuals with Chinese Communist Party ties, and the freewheeling, lightly regulated gambling industry of a vital American ally. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many lawmakers now say the case demands a thoughtful reckoning for Australia — and other countries — that have welcomed Chinese wealth but often closed their eyes to its source, and to whether its riches are being used to promote the interests of the Communist Party.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the center of the inquiry, Australian officials say, is Crown Resorts, the casino giant formerly controlled by one of Australia’s richest men, James Packer. The company has been accused of helping its most lucrative clients launder money and circumvent Australia’s strict immigration laws.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Chai is not the main target of the investigation, officials say. But among other things, investigators are exploring his ties to Tom Zhou, the businessman who was on the plane with him and who himself has ties to Crown.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Investigators are also looking into the source of Mr. Chai’s money — including millions of dollars gambled at Crown casinos — and whether it was used in Australia to support the interests of the <!-- -->Chinese Communist Party.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There is no evidence or suggestion that Mr. Xi had any knowledge of or involvement with any of Mr. Chai’s activities. In a statement, Crown said it “absolutely rejects allegations of illegality,” describing them as “an attempt to smear the company.” Mr. Packer, through his lawyer, said he has not held an executive position at the company since 2012 and had a passive role in Crown’s affairs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The inquiry into Mr. Chai’s activities was<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theage.com.au/topic/crown-unmasked-1n3o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> first reported</a> by Australian news outlets The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and Nine, a television network. The Australian police declined to comment. On Tuesday, China’s Foreign Ministry dismissed the news reports as “gossip.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They tried to smear China with groundless accusations based on some rumors,” said Hua Chunying, <!-- -->a ministry spokeswoman,<!-- --> at a regular news briefing. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The initial focus of the investigation was Mr. Zhou, whose company, known simply as Chinatown, organized gambling tours for clients betting tens of millions of dollars. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He worked closely with sales managers for Crown’s so-called V.I.P. program, acting as a business partner who delivered wealthy gamblers and vouched for their legitimacy, earning hefty commissions in the process, according to company emails from 2013 to 2015 that The New York Times reviewed. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These <!-- -->emails and other internal records <!-- -->reviewed by The Times<!-- --> referred repeatedly to Mr. Zhou<!-- --> and his company along with <!-- -->several other intermediaries<!-- --> known as junket operators, who often move large sums of money for their clients, with little transparency. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The amounts flowing out of China were multiples more than the official limit placed on ordinary Chinese citizens by the Chinese government, raising questions about fraud and money laundering, according to the documents and interviews with business associates of Mr. Chai and Mr. Zhou in Hong Kong and China.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Efforts to reach Mr. Chai and Mr. Zhou through their companies and business associates in China were unsuccessful. Several Chinese-Australian social and business groups to which Mr. Zhou has been publicly linked also did not respond to requests for comment. One group, Huaxing Arts Group Australia, said “we don’t have any person by this name in our Association.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the large home in Melbourne that Mr. Chai’s wife purchased in 2011 for 3.85 million Australian dollars ($2.6 million), according to property records, a woman speaking on a cellphone in the front yard declined to answer questions. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The documents from Crown suggest there was little if any scrutiny of where money from Mr. Chai or other high-rollers came from, despite <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2018C00101" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">laws requiring that casinos “know your customer.”</a> (Crown has said it has a comprehensive anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing program.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Crown documents also show that the biggest spenders were lured with flights, cash advances and other perks.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tickets to events, including a Mariah Carey concert, and seats on private jets were only part of the packages. Emails from 2015 also show that Crown officials worked closely with Australian Consulate officers to fast-track visa approvals for Chinese clients through a special “hotline.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was used often enough for one Crown executive to warn that “the purpose of the special line is not for last minute girlfriend additions.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rather, the executive wrote, it should be reserved for “critical cases (ie big customers).”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In those situations,” he wrote, “the consulate is very understanding and will do everything they can to help us.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement on Tuesday, the Department of Home Affairs confirmed it has “stakeholder arrangements” with several large international organizations for speedy processing of short stay visas, but insisted there was no special treatment given to applicants.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The department said the arrangement with Crown ended in 2016. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2017, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/business/crown-resorts-china-sentencing.html?module=inline" title="">a court in Shanghai sentenced</a> three Australian employees of Crown to prison for illegally promoting gambling in China.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Separately, court transcripts in China show Mr. Zhou, who is also known as Zhou Jiuming, has been named in several civil and criminal cases including one that accuses him of misappropriating “a huge amount” of funds. That same case references separate criminal charges against him and cites investigations by the police for economic crimes in Wuhan, China. Details of Mr. Zhou’s criminal charges are not publicly available.</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">For more Australia coverage with global perspective, </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/australia-letter?utm_source=ausend" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">get the Australia Letter in your inbox</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Zhou and Mr. Chai were business partners through companies registered in Hong Kong and Australia that <!-- -->are suspected <!-- -->of being set up simply to move large sums of money out of China to Australia, according to <!-- -->a person familiar with the companies, and the Australian authorities<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Chai is listed in several internal Crown documents as one of the company’s V.V.I.P.s, or Very Very Important Persons. One internal record shows he had spent $28 million (41 million Australian dollars) over 18 months starting in June of 2012, and in the following year he was listed as one of Crown’s top 50 customers based on gambling turnover.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is not clear when he became an Australian citizen, but corporate registrations with his Australian passport go as far back as 2005.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among the questions being asked now, Australian officials said, is whether Mr. Chai is simply a partner of Mr. Zhou, or has played a broader role with other Communist Party officials who the authorities believe might have been trying to launder money through Australian casinos, or move money to finance foreign interference or espionage in Australia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several of the Chinese-Australian groups Mr. Zhou has been involved with in Australia, including the Hubei Association of Australia and Huaxing Arts Group of Melbourne have been described by analysts as closely aligned with the United Front Work Department, a muscular agency that presses for support of the Communist Party agenda abroad. United Front associates have been linked with campaign contributions and other efforts to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/world/australia/australia-china-huang-xiangmo.html?module=inline" title="">influence Australian politics.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the plane that was searched in 2016, according to information shared among law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, Mr. Chai and another passenger referred to Mr. Zhou as the boss when confronted by the Australian authorities.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Chai, however, enjoys an elevated status in China’s business and political worlds because of his family connections within the Communist <!-- -->Party.<!-- --> At one point, he was described as leading a research institute at the Central Party School, the party’s main academy for training officials. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His father, Qi Ruixin, was a vice party secretary of the China National Gold Group and a top official at China’s so-called Gold Force, the gold and mineral exploration arm of the People’s Armed Police. Mr. Qi was described in his official biography as being close to Mr. Xi. </p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Read more: </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/world/australia/australia-china.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">How Australia became a global case study in Chinese political interference</em></a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In business, Mr. Chai’s dealings were varied and seemed to draw on his father’s contacts.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A half-dozen companies in Hong Kong are registered under Mr. Chai’s name. One, Cathay Bullion Marketing Services, appears to have a connection to silver and gold. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More recently, he held a senior position at a company owned by ZTE, a telecommunications company, and appeared at events for ZTE like<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/business/xi-jinping-china-trade-boao.html?module=inline" title=""> Boao, an annual economic forum</a> for the global elite. ZTE did not respond to a request for comment about Mr. Chai. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He also worked as the chief executive of a robotics and telecoms company, Ningbo GQY.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of Mr. Chai’s businesses, HK Success Ocean Investment, is registered to a red brick house in a neighborhood on the southeast fringe of Melbourne. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Neighbors said they were not sure who lived there. Some said they believed that the home had been rented, with new residents only recently moving in.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Australian officials who were briefed on the investigation into Crown and Mr. Zhou said several agencies had been looking into elements of the case for years, but that in recent months, they came to believe they were scrutinizing limbs of the same giant beast.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The expanding scandal has fueled concerns about Australia’s permissiveness both with its own gambling industry, and China’s powerful elites.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several new inquiries have been ordered, in the state of Victoria and by Australia’s attorney general, Christian Porter. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lawmakers have only just begun to consider the broader implications of the case and how the country’s response will be viewed by China, and the world’s democracies.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The time has come when you have to stand up for those values and not be clouded by financial interests,” said Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells from New South Wales, in an interview between votes in the Senate. “If we profess to support an international rules-based order then we have to continue to support that rules-based order.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Damien Cave reported from Sydney, Australia, and Alexandra Stevenson from Beijing.</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Livia Albeck-Ripka contributed reporting from Melbourne, Australia, and Jamie Tarabay from Queenstown, New Zealand.
