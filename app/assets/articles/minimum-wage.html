<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WASHINGTON — The House voted Thursday to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, delivering a long-sought victory to liberals and putting the Democratic Party’s official imprimatur on the so-called Fight for $15, which many Democratic presidential candidates have embraced.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The bill would more than double the federal minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour — about $15,000 a year for someone working 40 hours a week, or about $10,000 less than the federal poverty level for a family of four. It has not been raised since 2009, the longest time the country has gone without a minimum-wage increase since it was established 1938.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The measure, which passed largely along party lines, 231-199, after Republicans branded it a jobs-killer, faces a steep climb in the Senate. Only three Republicans voted for it, while six Democrats opposed it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But it previews what Democrats would do if they captured the Senate and the White House in 2020, and it demonstrates how fast the politics have shifted since 2012, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/30/nyregion/fast-food-workers-in-new-york-city-rally-for-higher-wages.html?module=inline" title="">when fast-food workers began to strike</a> in cities around the country, demanding $15-an-hour wages and a union.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the time, the figure seemed absurdly high, and even Democrats thought it was politically impossible. In the years since, even Republican states like Arkansas and Missouri have raised minimum wages, encouraging Democrats on Capitol Hill. In 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, pushed the issue to the fore when he challenged Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is an historic day,” declared Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who argued that raising the minimum would disproportionately help women, who make up more than half of minimum wage workers, and would particularly help women of color. Turning to Republicans, she said: “No one can live with dignity on a $7.25-per-hour minimum wage. Can you?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, Democratic moderates — especially those who represent districts carried by President Trump — were nervous about the measure, and it took champions of the bill months to bring them around. In the end, the sponsors tacked on two provisions: one authorizing a study of the measure’s effects after it has been in place for two years, and another extending the deadline for a $15 minimum wage from 2024 to 2025.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the liberal Democrat from New York and a strong ally of the Fight for $15 movement, called the vote a “huge deal.” But she signaled the fight is not over.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s not just about $15, it’s about $15 and a union,” she said. “Fifteen started 10 years ago, so what is that pegged to inflation today? That’s why what we fight for is a living wage. So I think that this vote is an important milestone. I think this vote is crucial.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 will pull 1.3 million Americans out of poverty and could result in wage increases for up to 27 million workers, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/federal-minimum-wage.html?module=inline" title="">according to a recent Congressional Budget Office analysis</a>. But it would leave 1.3 million people, or 0.08 percent of the work force, out of a job, the same study concluded. While the legislation would boost incomes at the bottom, it would cost richer households and would slightly reduce gross domestic product.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A smaller minimum wage increase would be virtually painless, but it would also benefit fewer low-wage earners. If the pay floor increased to $10 per hour by 2025, for instance, 3.5 million workers might get a raise and there would be little effect on overall employment, the C.B.O. found.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Republicans focused on the C.B.O.’s job loss figure, as well as regional disparities in the cost of living. They invoked their favorite epithet for the Democrats of the new House — “socialist” — in arguing against the measure.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Let’s leave freedom in the hands of the people, in the hands of the states — that’s what this country is all about,” said Representative Virginia Foxx, Republican of North Carolina, who managed the bill for Republicans on the House floor. “In socialist regimes, all decision are made by a small group of people at a central government. That is not the American way.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economists have increasingly accepted that some level of minimum wage increase can work — coming at a minimal cost to jobs — in some jurisdictions, said David Neumark, an economist at the University of California at Irvine who has studied minimum wages extensively.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But a one-size-fits-all policy that more than doubles some businesses’ wage bills could hit employers in lower-pay areas hard, he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It has had what I would say was a remarkable and unexpected political success,” Mr. Neumark said of the $15 minimum. “Does it make sense? Call me skeptical.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But some advocates of a higher minimum wage want to push pay up even farther. Among them is Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the union-funded Employment Policy Institute, who said even $15 will not be adequate if workers have to wait until 2021, when a Democrat could again occupy the White House.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The Fight for $15 was launched in 2012, and every year that passes, the purchasing power of $15 goes down,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi had promised a vote on the wage bill soon after Democrats took power in January, but party leaders soon found that was going to be impossible; too many moderates were uneasy with it. Along with Representative Robert C. Scott, Democrat of Virginia and the bill’s chief sponsor, Ms. Pelosi deputized Representative Stephanie Murphy, who represents a swing district in Florida, to build support for the bill.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Murphy’s district includes Disney World, which recently agreed to raise its minimum wage to $15 by 2021. She said moderates had expressed concern about regional disparities and the impact of the bill on small businesses. Only within the past few weeks, after the sponsors agreed to the added provisions, did the moderates come around.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’re unifying behind the idea that we need to help hardworking families make ends meet,” Ms. Murphy said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To fast-food workers like Terrence Wise, 40, who lives in Kansas City, Mo., and makes $12 an hour working full-time at McDonald’s, the vote shows the power of grass-roots activism.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What we’re doing is working,” said Mr. Wise, an early member and longtime leader of the Fight for $15 movement. “We’re a powerful voting bloc, and we will take that power to the ballot box.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The push for a $15 minimum wage began in New York City, when a group called New York Communities for Change started visiting fast-food restaurants and talking to workers about their grievances. Along with the Service Employees International Union, it invited them to organizing meetings in Brooklyn. After getting together and talking, the workers decided to ask their employers for $15 and a union.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Fast food workers always believed that there would be a national shift to $15,” said Mary Kay Henry, head of Service Employees International Union, which has helped provide institutional support to Fight for $15 from the outset. She recalled marching alongside them in 2012 and thinking that the goal was ambitious — because Democrats were talking about $9 and $10.10 minimums at the time. “I remember thinking, ‘Holy moly. How long is this going to take us?’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Seven states have now passed legislation to gradually raise wages to $15, and cities including San Francisco and New York City already pay that much. In total, 29 states now have floors higher than the federal minimum, according to the Labor Department.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Companies have even joined in, with corporations including Amazon and Target raising their base wages to $15. By the 2016 midterm elections, $15 was resonating at a national level, making it into the Democratic Party platform. Support for striking workers has become common among Democratic presidential hopefuls including South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The successes in the municipalities and states are key,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who has advised Republican presidential candidates and is now president of the American Action Forum. “All of that laid down the predicate that people wanted this.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Mr. Holtz-Eakin said raising the national minimum wage would be a mistake, in part because labor conditions vary dramatically around the country. The wage level that causes no or little harm to businesses in San Francisco might severely hurt those in Mississippi. He said it is unlikely that the minimum wage will pass at $15 by 2025, even if a Democrat wins the White House in 2020.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Politically, it’s a popular one, there’s no question,” he said. “I think it gets bargained down in the process.”</p>
