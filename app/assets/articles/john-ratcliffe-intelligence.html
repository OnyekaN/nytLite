<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before President Trump picked Dan Coats to be the director of national intelligence, Mr. Coats spent 24 years in Washington as a member of the House and the Senate from Indiana, serving long stints on both the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. He had also been ambassador to Germany.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His predecessors included James Clapper, an Air Force lieutenant general <!-- -->who previously headed two other intelligence agencies<!-- -->, and Adm. Dennis Blair, who commanded United States naval forces in the Pacific.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After an increasingly difficult tenure, Mr. Coats is stepping down and Mr. Trump has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/politics/trump-ratcliffe-national-intelligence.html?module=inline" title="">chosen as his replacement</a> Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The 2004 law creating the position of director of national intelligence says that whoever holds the post must have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-108publ458/pdf/PLAW-108publ458.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“extensive national security expertise,”</a> <!-- -->but Mr. Ratcliffe has been a House member only since 2015 and j<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/politics/trump-ratcliffe-national-intelligence.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">oined the House Intelligence Committee just this year.</a> Before that he was a small-town mayor and a United States attorney, apparently with little or no experience dealing with terrorism or national security issues. He may have even <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-pick-inteligence-director-misrepresented-role-anti-terror/story?id=64646682" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">falsely claimed</a> to have prosecuted terrorists.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One reason Mr. Coats’s tenure was so uncomfortable was that, unlike many Trump appointees, he was more likely to say what he believed to be true than what the president wanted to hear.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even some influential Republican senators are concerned that Mr. Trump’s main reason for picking Mr. Ratcliffe is his intense loyalty, and not his experience on intelligence issues.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he didn’t even know Mr. Ratcliffe. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I talked to him on the phone last night,” Mr. Burr said. “It’s the first contact I’ve ever had with him.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That Mr. Ratcliffe’s record seems so undistinguished by relevant experience and so filled with examples of partisanship makes it all the more vital that the Senate carefully vet him.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Days before Robert Mueller, the former special counsel, testified last week that Russia had corrupted the 2016 presidential race and was once more <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/opinion/robert-mueller-report-testimony.html?module=inline" title="">“doing it as we sit here,”</a> Mr. <!-- -->Coats <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/us/politics/intelligence-election-security.html?searchResultPosition=13&amp;module=inline" title="">appointed an experienced official </a>to oversee election security intelligence across the government in a newly created senior position. A bit late in the game, but it amounted to an act of courage in the face of Mr. Trump’s adamant refusal to acknowledge the problem and respond forcefully ahead <!-- -->of the 2020 elections.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Ratcliffe <!-- -->appears to have<!-- --> caught Mr. Trump’s eye by being a dogged critic of the Russia investigation and claiming that the F.B.I. harassed Mr. Trump. During Mr. Mueller’s testimony, Mr. Ratcliffe accused Mr. Mueller of violating American judicial norms by writing an inconclusive report about whether Mr. Trump committed a crime by obstructing justice.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Just before Mr. Trump picked him for the intelligence job, Mr. Ratcliffe was on the president’s favored source of intelligence, Fox News, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ijr.com/john-ratcliffe-crimes-committed-mueller-probe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">smearing the special counsel’s report</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Its conclusions weren’t from Robert Mueller, they were written by what a lot of people believe was Hillary Clinton’s de facto legal team, people that had supported her, even represented some of her aides,” he said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Coats has defended the nation’s intelligence agencies in their unanimous finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. He <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/top-intelligence-official-told-associates-trump-asked-him-if-he-could-intervene-with-comey-to-get-fbi-to-back-off-flynn/2017/06/06/cc879f14-4ace-11e7-9669-250d0b15f83b_story.html?utm_term=.d6964ce836a4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">refused the president’s request</a> to get James Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end his investigation of Michael Flynn, the national security adviser who has since <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/us/politics/michael-flynn-guilty-russia-investigation.html?module=inline" title="">pleaded guilty</a> to lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These were not the only ways Mr. Coats rubbed Mr. Trump the wrong way. Time and again he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/29/dan-coats-north-korea-nuclear-weapons-1133969" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">delivered truths</a> at odds with Mr. Trump’s preferred version of reality — saying that North Korea was unlikely to abandon its nuclear weapons, that Iran was abiding by the nuclear deal, that the Islamic State continued to be a threat in Syria.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president made his position clear on Tuesday when he said that “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1156274361332117504" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the intelligence agencies have run amok</a>” and that Mr. Ratcliffe would “rein it in.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Coats wasn’t perfect. Some experts think he could have done more to protect America’s 17 intelligence agencies from politicization. But more often than not, he stood by the professionals and their analysis.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of the most important lessons from America’s response to the attacks of 9/11 <!-- -->that led to the creation of this post<!-- --> was that intelligence agencies need to work freely and honestly, and not be swayed by political considerations and the need to placate a president. <!-- -->An administration that sought and got the message it wanted from the intelligence apparatus is what <!-- --> helped lead to the invasion of Iraq and the disasters that followed. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Senate needs to be sure we don’t go down that road again.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
