<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Virginia Fuchs announced herself to the boxing world at the 2016 United States Olympic Trials, where she twice upset <!-- -->Marlen Esparza<!-- -->, a world champion. In 2017, Fuchs went 18-0. In 2018, she claimed a bronze medal at the world championships by attacking her flyweight opponents, on average, every four seconds during nine minutes of boxing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s an engine!” said Billy Walsh, the head coach for the American team. “She’s a supreme athlete. We joke and call her Seabiscuit because she’s like a racehorse.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fuchs, known as Ginny, is now the most established fighter from the United States at the <!-- -->Pan American Games<!-- --> this week. The same will most likely be true at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Pretty much everybody’s looking at me to win gold,” said Fuchs, a 31-year-old Texan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Boxing, though, is the least of her battles.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About 20 years ago, she learned she had severe <!-- -->obsessive-compulsive disorder<!-- -->. In January, Fuchs had a breakdown that sent her to inpatient treatment for the second time in her life.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She spent a month at an O.C.D. clinic in Houston.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I was like: I can’t function like this anymore,” she said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She grew so stuck in her cleaning rituals that she was training daily on three hours of sleep. One night, she said, she couldn’t stop at all and thought: “I’m out of control. I’m scared. I need serious help.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Elite athletes usually know how to solve their opponents. If they are taller and stronger, be quicker. If they are faster, be smarter. If they are tactically superior, be relentless. But what do you do when the most powerful opponent lies permanently within?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By definition, O.C.D. involves unwanted, recurring and distressing thoughts. In response, people often perform repetitive behaviors, or rituals, to alleviate the anxiety caused by the obsessions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But the ritual only works very temporarily,” said Dr. Joyce Davidson, a psychiatrist and medical director at the Menninger Clinic in Houston. “The obsessions keep coming back so people get stuck in this vicious circle of obsessions and rituals. In many cases, it really snowballs.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">O.C.D. symptoms go well beyond superstitions or tics.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People with O.C.D. are really tormented by their symptoms,” Dr. Davidson said. “It’s very disabling.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">O.C.D. takes many forms, and Fuchs’s obsessions and compulsions pertain to contamination and cross-contamination.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My mind is constantly thinking, ‘What did that touch?’” Fuchs said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For a boxer, being tormented by the thought of contamination is the ultimate paradox. Fighters are constantly exposed to opponents’ sweat, saliva and blood, and the rot of damp headgear and gloves.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For Fuchs, however, boxing actually provides a respite.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The sport requires such total and immediate focus, she said, that it’s the only setting where she can completely set aside the O.C.D. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In day-to-day things, I feel like the O.C.D. is more powerful than my regular mind,” she said, even though she knows it can be expensive, wasteful and infuriating to others.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In January, Fuchs was driving to Walmart three times a day to buy cleaning supplies — at $85 a pop. She is still trying to pay off $23,000 that four weeks at the Houston O.C.D. clinic cost her in February.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“She’ll buy flip-flops, wear them for an hour, and throw them away,” said her mother, Peg, a former elementary schoolteacher. Her older sister, Helen, has found full packages of latex gloves and unopened Kleenex boxes in the trash at home.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kay Koroma<!-- -->, an assistant coach with the United States boxing team, opened the trunk of Fuchs’s car one day and found it filled with supplies that Fuchs said were unusable because they had touched something else.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before her breakdown, Fuchs’s No. 1 priority was cleaning nonstop. “It made no sense in my clear mind,” she said. “But in my O.C.D. mind, it <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">had</em> to be done or I couldn’t move on with my day.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Instead of resting in her dorm room between training sessions at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Fuchs bleached all the soles of her shoes (high heels, sandals, trainers), tossed them in the washing machine and ran the machine empty between loads to wash the washer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her preshower cleaning routine took at least an hour and required entire tubs of facial wipes. The shower itself ran three to four hours, and she depleted several large bottles of shower gel and at least one full bar of soap.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Teeth cleaning took at least 30 minutes and as many as nine toothbrushes. Her dentist warned her that it could erode her enamel. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My O.C.D. doesn’t care,” said Fuchs, a graduate of Louisiana State. “I would rather feel the clean feeling and brush the enamel off my teeth.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’ve ruined so many things,” she added. “I even put my hair straightener in the washing machine.” It’s made of metal.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her boxing teammates had clues about her O.C.D. but didn’t immediately realize its severity.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Claressa Shields<!-- -->, the two-time Olympic middleweight champion, noticed that when they did push-ups or crunches in the ring, Fuchs put her hand in her sleeve, not on the canvas.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fuchs would stand on top of her shoes before stepping on the scale at weigh-ins. She never let her gloves or wraps hit the ground. If her mouthpiece fell on the floor, she would leave it there.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once, Koroma saw Fuchs with six bottles of Clorox. “How much clothes you got to wash?” he said he told her. “You got a lot of whites?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another day at the gym, her teammate <!-- -->Mikaela Mayer<!-- --> put her shoe on Fuchs. “Ginny freaked all the way out,” Shields said. “She ran to a shower and we didn’t hear from Ginny for a couple hours.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mayer, a 2016 Olympian and Fuchs’s best friend, noticed something was amiss the first time they shared a hotel room. Fuchs wouldn’t get out of the bathroom. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Within two hours, there was no toilet paper, all the towels are on the floor and dirty,” Mayer said. “She didn’t even shower and all the soap was gone. I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em>I started to spy on her. I would watch her do these routines. I would bust in the door and be like, ‘What did I just see?’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What people don’t know, Mayer said, is that as soon as Fuchs leaves the gym, she remembers exactly where blood spattered, snot flew and precisely where an armpit touched her shoulder. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“She uses her shower time scrubbing those parts of her body and remembering that,” Mayer said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unlike other O.C.D. cases, Fuchs’s cleaning rituals aren’t dictated by a fixed number of repetitions. “It’s a feeling,” she said. “I’m always searching for that perfect clean feeling.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet she is not a neat freak.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Far from it, Mayer said, because Fuchs’s idea of clean is completely different. “To her, it’s not visual; it’s all about germs and contamination,” Mayer explained. “So you’ll walk into her room and there are clothes all over the floor, but it’s a ‘clean’ area.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mayer and Koroma are really the only ones who see Fuchs struggle up-close, on a daily basis.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Koroma sees signs, he tries to keep Fuchs close and distract her with a movie, a walk or a video game. Sometimes, she would call crying in the middle of the night. “Usually I could talk her off the ledge,” he said. But the night she broke down in January, he knew it was serious.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He helped Fuchs pack and took her to the airport, and then he had to tell the team.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Everybody reached out to her, told her: ‘Yo, we got you. Everything’s cool,’” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Upon Fuchs’s return, her room had so many trigger points that she would often spend nights at Mayer’s home nearby, and still does. But Fuchs doesn’t always implement the changes she learned in treatment, like timing her showers and limiting her spending.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I can cuss her out because we’re best friends,” Mayer said. “But I really worry about her.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">U.S.A. Boxing now has three psychologists working together to help Fuchs. One is at the Olympic Training Center. One travels with the boxing team. And one is an O.C.D. specialist based in Colorado Springs she can see any time.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Every week, Fuchs and the O.C.D. specialist devise a plan, like planning to use only eight sponges per shower instead of 10, or breaking soap in half instead of using an entire bar in every shower. Fuchs reports her progress throughout the week.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Sometimes I’m able to be strong and do what we planned,” Fuchs said, but on bad days, her old habits return.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shields, the middleweight champion, remains optimistic that Fuchs will conquer O.C.D. as she has conquered so many of her other opponents.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Ginny can definitely beat this O.C.D. thing,” Shields said. “She wants to beat it. But just like you won in boxing, you got to get prepared. You got to take steps and make small goals,” she tells Fuchs, reminding her just how strong she is.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2016, even though she beat Esparza at the trials, Fuchs didn’t make the Olympic team. Instead she went to Rio de Janeiro as a sparring partner.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“After having all your dreams crushed for another four years, to come support us?” Shields said. “It meant the world to me. Maybe I’ll be that strong one day. Then she went 18-0? Come on! Nobody’s doing that. And she’s facing O.C.D.? That’s amazing.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For Fuchs, it’s just life.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is no cure,” she said. “It’s all about managing it. I’m a little better, but I have a long way to go.”</p>
