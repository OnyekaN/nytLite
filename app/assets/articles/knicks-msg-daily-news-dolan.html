<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Weeks after the Knicks were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/sports/knicks-daily-news-feud.html?module=inline" title="">fined by the N.B.A.</a> for barring The Daily News from a news conference, the team’s parent company has become embroiled in a bitter dispute with the newspaper that is cast in unusually personal terms.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Wednesday, The Daily News <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/knicks/ny-james-dolan-msg-inglewood-lawsuit-deposition-clippers-arena-20190717-vrdv6kg6rbgmbaqcwa2yq3gnv4-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published an article</a> about a long-running battle over a real estate development project in Inglewood, Calif., a city just south of Los Angeles.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">James L. Dolan is chief executive of the Madison Square Garden Company, the holding company that controls the Knicks, Madison Square Garden and other venues including the Forum in Inglewood, where the Los Angeles Lakers played for over 30 years before moving to downtown Los Angeles in 1999. Dolan purchased the Forum in 2012.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The article, under the headline “James Dolan and MSG are waging a war on Inglewood over new Clippers arena project,” was critical of a lawsuit Dolan filed against the city of Inglewood and of his efforts to protect his stake in the lucrative Los Angeles concert business.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a bombastic statement emailed to reporters and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/NY_KnicksPR/status/1151479148809981952" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">tweeted by the Knicks public relations account</a> on Wednesday, the Madison Square Garden Company accused The Daily News of animus, saying Dolan had once fired Timothy P. Knight, now the head of Tribune Publishing, which owns The Daily News. In a statement at the time, in 2009, Knight said he had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/business/media/24paper.html?module=inline" title="">quit as the publisher of Newsday</a>, which is owned by the Dolan family and based on Long Island.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The dispute comes at a time when hopes for a turnaround by the long-struggling Knicks have been roundly dashed, and a summer that Dolan promised would herald a new era for the franchise has instead highlighted continued dysfunction at the highest levels.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/sports/basketball/knicks-durant-kyrie-dolan.html?module=inline" title=""> elite free agents</a> — including Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and Kyrie Irving — hit the market this summer; they all bypassed the Knicks and the allure of calling the Garden their home. Stars clamoring to be traded also ignored Dolan’s team.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the worst record in the league last season, the Knicks had a strong chance of landing the top draft pick and Zion Williamson, the Duke star who is considered a once-in-a-generation prospect. The lottery gave them the No. 3 pick instead, and they took Williamson’s college teammate R.J. Barrett, whose introductory news conference led to a $50,000 fine against the Knicks for barring The Daily News.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In its statement on Wednesday, the Madison Square Garden Company called the article about the Los Angeles real estate project an “epically overwritten hit piece” and said it was one of many “egregious, personal attacks” by The Daily News.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Robert York, the editor in chief of The Daily News, said that there was “no truth” to any claims of a personal vendetta and that The Daily News’ “sole mission is to accurately report relevant news, and this piece fits the classic definition of newsworthy information.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the Knicks organization has frequently sparred with The Daily News over articles about the team’s poor performance in the past two decades, the rancor has reached a new level with the reporting on Dolan’s legal and financial dealings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2017, Inglewood entered into an agreement with Steve Ballmer, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, for a new basketball arena near the Forum. Ballmer wants to move the Clippers out of Staples Center, which they share with the Lakers, and into a building he owns.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The next year, the Madison Square Garden Company sued Inglewood and its mayor, James T. Butts Jr., accusing Butts of tricking the company into giving up land that could now be used as part of Ballmer’s arena project. Besides hosting Clippers games, the new arena would potentially compete with the Forum for concerts and other events that come to the Los Angeles area.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to The Daily News, during a deposition Dolan gave in the lawsuit last year he said that he had barely known an Inglewood mayoral candidate whom he supported with significant funding and that he had tried to get the Lakers to return to The Forum.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Daily News also reported that the Madison Square Garden Company had tried to rally influential entertainment figures to oppose the Clippers plans, and that the company was funding a lawsuit by a community group that claims Inglewood violated the California Environmental Quality Act.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rather than respond directly to The Daily News reporting, the Madison Square Garden Company’s statement called the article “grossly misleading.” No errors in the reporting were cited.</p>
