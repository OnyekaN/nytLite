<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dorian Harris, 17, grabbed a few cans of <!-- -->Spiked Watermelon beer<!-- --> from a cooler in the Top Stop Shop in Memphis last year. He ran out the door without paying, dropping one in his haste. The store clerk grabbed a handgun and chased him, firing off a few shots into the dark night, on March 29, the authorities said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think I shot him,” the clerk, Anwar Ghazali, 29, told a customer when he returned to the store, according to a police affidavit and the Shelby County District Attorney’s office. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Ghazali didn’t call the police, the authorities said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Harris’s<!-- --> body was discovered two days later in a nearby yard, where he had bled to death from a gunshot wound in the back of his left leg, the district attorney’s office said, and Mr. Ghazali was arrested.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a four-day trial, Mr. Ghazali was convicted by a jury on Thursday of second-degree murder, the Shelby County district attorney, Amy Weirich, said in a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.scdag.com/news/item/1826-jury-convicts-clerk-in-teen-s-death?fbclid=IwAR3f4q9rXshWgIT1hWtb9Cs1M_xuO-F77k8XDFCblcAKkQqL8W6489DJzXc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">statement on Friday.</a> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lora Fowler, a prosecutor, said<!-- --> Mr. Harris had been “left to bleed out and die.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This defendant took it upon himself to be the judge and jury and the executioner over a $2 beer,” she said of Mr. Ghazali, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2019/08/15/store-clerk-found-guilty-second-degree-murder-shooting-killing-teen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">WMC Action News in Memphis</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Ghazali faces 15 to 25 years in prison and will be sentenced on Sept. 23, his lawyer, Blake Ballin, said in an email on Monday. He was initially indicted on first-degree murder charges, which would have carried a life sentence, but Mr. Ballin argued at the trial that the case was “neither a premeditated nor a knowing killing.” <!-- -->The gun belonged to the store’s owner, he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Mr. Ghazali maintains that he had no intent to kill Mr. Harris over a stolen beer,” he said in the email. “Rather, he acted recklessly when he wildly fired into a dark field as Mr. Harris ran away in order to scare him.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said that Mr. Ghazali did not call the police because he did not believe that he had actually hit the teenager with gunfire. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the shooting, several dozen people protested, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/story/37864167/neighborhood-protests-store-after-owner-shoots-kills-suspected-shoplifter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">demanding the closing of the store</a>, according to local news reports. Mr. Ballin said Mr. Ghazali had worked there as a cashier for about two months. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If we don’t value black lives and believe that Dorian’s life is worth far more than an allegedly stolen beer, then we’re not authentically honoring my father,” the Rev.

Harris wasn’t on trial. The trial was about whether Ghazali, who wasn’t in fear of his life, should have shot and killed a fleeing Harris for stealing a $2 drink.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement released after the verdict, Mr. Ballin described Memphis as a community that is struggling and plagued by racial and economic inequality. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I understand why this case has caused public frustration, because another African-American kid has been needlessly killed,” Mr. Ballin said in an email on Monday. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But decisions of guilt and innocence and questions of intent should not be based on emotion,” he said. “The defense team did our best to make sure that the jury rendered a verdict based on the facts of the case and not on the color of someone’s skin. That would just be another injustice.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Why did this happen to my son?” Mr. Harris’s father, Hanson <!-- -->Peete<!-- -->, told <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2019/08/12/store-clerk-facing-trial-police-say-he-shot-killed-teen-stealing-beer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">WMC Action News</a> at the start of the trial; he could not be reached by telephone or email on Monday. “Why was it that he was left there like that?
