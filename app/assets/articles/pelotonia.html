<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Erika Decker knew three things about John Looker when he reached out to her on Facebook in 2014: He was <!-- -->a cult figure<!-- --> in Columbus, Ohio, where <!-- -->they both lived<!-- -->. He had become a face of the Pelotonia bike-a-thon, which has raised millions of dollars to fight cancer. And he had the same brain cancer as her young daughter, Lily.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Looker had read about Lily in The Columbus Dispatch and wanted to show his support. “I know I’m a stranger to you and your family, but please know that I am with you all in spirit today,” he wrote.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A few days later, another note: “I would love to come visit with you and your family.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Decker, 46, was curious. So one night she scoured his Facebook page. It was loaded with health updates, inspirational quotations and community adoration. But something didn’t seem right.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She wrote back and asked for the name of his oncologist.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I generally don’t share it because several years ago I did, and she got bombarded by phone calls from the Pelotonia community asking her to do more for me,” he wrote. Ms. Decker repeated her question. Mr. Looker “unfriended” her on Facebook.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">John Looker’s rise to celebrity cancer patient officially began Aug. 19, 2011, in a field outside Columbus. It was at an opening ceremony for Pelotonia, which was founded in 2008. Sponsors included NetJets, <!-- -->Huntington bank<!-- --> and L Brands Foundation. Participants cycled as many as 180 miles and were required to raise at least $1,200. One hundred percent of the donations benefited cancer research at the <!-- -->James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pelotonia is one of hundreds of endurance events that raise money for charities, tapping a fund-raising source — friends, relatives and colleagues of participants — that has become lucrative.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Pelotonia’s almost a religion,” Ben Addison, 54, Mr. Looker’s former romantic partner, said. “People take it very seriously.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lance Armstrong kicked off the first Pelotonia in 2009. Chris Spielman, a retired N.F.L. player whose wife, Stefanie, died of breast cancer, was the next year’s spokesman. By the time Mr. Looker came on in 2011, Pelotonia was up to 5,000 participants and had raised some $25 million. The total entering this year’s event, which begins Friday, was more than $194 million. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Looker addressed the crowd on a large video screen in 2011. “Let me make this short and sweet,” he said. “I have Stage 4 terminal brain cancer. I will ride tomorrow. And I won’t be making any excuses.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He bounded onstage in khaki shorts and a blue T-shirt with Pelotonia’s “One Goal” slogan on it. A roar erupted.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I was in awe,” Dr. Diane <!-- -->LeMay<!-- -->, 54, a pediatrician and first-time Pelotonia participant, said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The next year, Mr. Looker, who grew up in Newark, Ohio, sang the national anthem. By then he was a local star. He couldn’t go anywhere without someone snapping a photo or offering to buy him dinner. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I was Prince Philip and he was the queen,” Mr. Addison said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Looker’s most devoted followers called themselves Looker’s Hookers. They logged hundreds of miles, raising money for Pelotonia in Mr. Looker’s honor. They posted images on social media with a #loveforlooker hashtag. They bought cookies — Lookies — that Mr. Looker had baked, and they worked at his yard sale each spring. Donations were in cash or in checks made out to Mr. Looker.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He was always very sweet and charming,” said Joshua Platt, 45, a marketing executive and member of Mr. Looker’s brigade. Mr. Platt’s sister was fighting breast cancer and his mother-in-law had died with a glioblastoma tumor, the type of tumor Mr. Looker said he had.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Looker seemed to be beating the odds. “That brought a lot of hope,” Mr. Platt said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite his illness, he was generous with his time. He reached out to cancer patients and their families. That’s how he met Ms. Decker, and how everything began to come apart.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After reviewing his Facebook page, Ms. Decker’s fraud detector went off. The tumors did not make sense to her; they didn’t metastasize, but just moved around. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He would be O.K., and then they’d find one in his chest or head,” said Ms. Decker, who now lives in Cody, Wyo. “Every spring before Pelotonia registration his cancer would return. And he was always overweight.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In early 2015, Ms. Decker spoke with Michelle Merlino, who had worked with Mr. Looker at Continental Office, a furniture supply company. Mr. Looker was captain of Continental’s cycling team, which raised money for Pelotonia. From 2011 to 2013, Ms. Merlino, 48, was a Looker disciple, joining him on weekend rides and donating to his fund. But then she started to have doubts: Mr. Looker did not seem to spend any time in a hospital; instead, he held a full-time job, rode his bike and baked a dozen cookies a day.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Merlino and Ms. Decker took their concerns to Kelley Griesmer, Pelotonia’s chief operating officer. To their surprise, she said Pelotonia had its own doubts. But regulations on patient privacy prevented organizers from questioning his doctor, and there was no evidence that he had misappropriated funds.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Griesmer, a former bankruptcy lawyer who now runs the Women’s Fund of Central Ohio, a nonprofit, noticed that Mr. Looker enjoyed the attention he got from his relationship with the cycling event and that the medical information he shared seemed extraordinary.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He was ingratiating himself with riders <!-- -->without our request,<!-- --> and I was concerned by that,” she said. “At the same time, I was, and am in, no position to say he was lying.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And yet Pelotonia did remove Mr. Looker’s promotional video from its website, cut him out of publicity materials and removed him from reports. With only rumors to go on at the time, it did not bar him from riding in the event or from soliciting money, and said nothing publicly.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Merlino and Ms. Decker were not happy. Shouldn’t the community know that the Pelotonia legend was possibly a fake?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of Mr. Looker’s closest friends were also becoming uneasy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In May 2016, Dr. LeMay was one of four people helping Mr. Looker with his yard sale. Anything she sold was supposed to be deposited into her Pelotonia fund-raising account. By October, the money still wasn’t there, she said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then, in August 2018, at least seven years into Mr. Looker’s supposed illness, two other Looker’s Hookers, Paul Harrison and Dave MacPhail, grew doubtful. Mr. MacPhail, 57, had known Mr. Looker since the mid ’90s. Back then, he recalled, Mr. Looker said he had colon cancer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The three decided to confront Mr. Looker. But first they sat down with Mr. Addison.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Addison didn’t believe it. He and Mr. Looker had been together 17 years; how could his partner have made up a disease? “You’d never think someone would lie about having cancer,” Mr. Addison said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About a week later, Dr. LeMay and Mr. MacPhail met with Pelotonia’s chief executive, Doug Ulman, who once ran Lance Armstrong’s Livestrong foundation, and two other employees. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He said he wasn’t concerned about the money they may have lost from John, but he was concerned about how this situation might affect us,” Dr. LeMay said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A spokeswoman for Pelotonia said Mr. Ulman was simply reassuring Dr. LeMay and Mr. MacPhail that they shouldn’t beat themselves up about the estimated loss, thought to be less than $1,500.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Aug. 25, Dr. LeMay, Mr. MacPhail and Mr. Harrison arrived at Mr. Addison’s Colonial-style house, where Mr. Looker had lived for almost two decades.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I know you don’t have cancer,” Mr. MacPhail said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Looker insisted he did.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. MacPhail asked for his doctor’s name.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Jane Libbey,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They Googled it. Nothing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. LeMay asked for medical records, a pill bottle, an explanation of benefits. Mr. Looker, who kept his head shaved like a cancer patient, could not provide anything. Within an hour, they said, he admitted that he had made the whole thing up and that he had used some of the money he had collected over the years for “living expenses.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Looker rubbed his head, looked down at the floor and cried.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I need help,” he sobbed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. LeMay and Mr. MacPhail took him to an emergency room. Then they called his mother. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Looker and his parents declined several interview requests.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The group then went to Pelotonia. Four days later, Mr. Ulman issued a statement. A three-time cancer survivor, he acknowledged that Pelotonia had heard rumors about Mr. Looker’s deception three years earlier, had removed publicity related to him and had now filed a complaint with the Charitable Law Section of the Ohio attorney general’s office over whether he kept cash donations. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. LeMay and Mr. MacPhail filed a complaint with the Columbus Division of Police, claiming that Mr. Looker had withheld at least $1,300 in donations from the May 2016 garage sale. There were other complaints from residents who said Mr. Looker had not turned over money supposedly raised on their behalf.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In an interview with the police, Mr. Looker confessed to keeping $800 to $900 because he was “strapped for cash.” He said he had been given a diagnosis as “manic depressant and bipolar,” which caused him to lie about the brain cancer. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The police declined to pursue charges; according to a spokeswoman, there was not enough evidence.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In April, Dr. LeMay filed a complaint with the Ohio attorney general’s office against Pelotonia. “They allowed someone to perpetuate a myth and a fraud to raise money,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Platt said he believes Pelotonia had “a moral obligation” to do more to protect the community.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A press officer for Pelotonia said: “People are conflating 2015 with 2018 circumstances, which are vastly different. The organization was made aware of additional facts against Mr. Looker in 2018, upon which they acted immediately.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This week, the attorney general’s office announced a settlement with Mr. Looker, 50. He agreed to pay $1,800 in restitution and a $2,000 civil fine. He also cannot solicit donations or hold any position with a charitable organization in Ohio, except as a volunteer uninvolved with charitable trust money.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In an email, Daniel H. Rosenthal, chairman of Pelotonia’s board, said that “Pelotonia simply cannot independently verify what each individual participant says about themselves.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://pelotonia.org/the-blog/2019/07/31/an-open-letter-to-the-pelotonia-community-from-doug-ulman-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a statement to the Pelotonia community</a>, Mr. Ulman said that before the charity features survivors in any way, they will have to sign a release guaranteeing their statements are true.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">No one has heard from Mr. Looker since his confession. His ex, Mr. Addison, has insisted he was always in the dark, traveling for work and never accompanying Mr. Looker to medical appointments. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. LeMay is trying to work through the betrayal. How could she, a doctor, have fallen for it?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her one consolation is that she believes Mr. Looker targeted her precisely because her profession helped him look better.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He was so good at his crime,” she said. </p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Abby Ellin is the author of “Duped: Double Lives, False Identities and the Con Man I Almost Married.”</p>
