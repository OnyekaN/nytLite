<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">FILIPSTAD, Sweden — At first, local leaders were inclined to see the refugees as an opportunity. The iron ore mines had shut down. So had a factory that made machinery for the logging industry. The town had been abandoned, its population cut in half. A shot at replenishment appeared at hand.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was the summer of 2015, and people were arriving from some of the most troubled places on earth — Syria, Somalia, Iraq. They would fill vacant homes, learn Swedish, and take jobs caring for older Swedes. They would pay taxes, helping finance the extensive social welfare programs that have made Sweden a rarity in the world, a country seemingly at peace in an age of tempestuous global capitalism.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But four years after the influx, growing numbers of native-born Swedes have come to see the refugees as a drain on public finances. Some decry an assault on “Swedish heritage,” or “Swedish culture,” or other words that mean white, Christian and familiar. Antipathy for immigrants now threatens to erode support for Sweden’s social welfare state.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People don’t want to pay taxes to support people who don’t work,” says Urban Pettersson, 62, a member of the local council here in Filipstad, a town set in lake country west of Stockholm. “Ninety percent of the refugees don’t contribute to society. These people are going to have a lifelong dependence on social welfare. This is a huge problem.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a global economy increasingly besieged by rage over inequality and the pitfalls of winner-take-all capitalism, Sweden has long stood out as a kinder, gentler sort of country, a potential template for other nations eager to avoid destructive populism.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The so-called Nordic model that prevails in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland has been engineered to protect people from the commonplace economic afflictions assailing many developed countries, and especially the United States. There, the loss of a job can swiftly imperil health care, housing, sustenance and mental well-being. Under the Nordic model, governments typically furnish health care, education and pensions to everyone.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The state delivers subsidized housing and child care. When people lose jobs, they gain unemployment benefits and highly effective job training programs. When children are born, parents avail themselves of paid leave that seems unimaginable in most societies — 480 days in Sweden.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If you’re born in Sweden, you’ve basically won at life,” says Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As world leaders debate how to keep the innovative forces of capitalism while more equitably spreading the bounty, the Nordic model is often played up as a promising approach.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the rest of the world, workers generally fear automation as a threat to paychecks. In Sweden, people are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/the-robots-are-coming-and-sweden-is-fine.html?module=inline" title="">strikingly optimistic</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/the-robots-are-coming-and-sweden-is-fine.html?module=inline" title="">about robots</a> given their faith in the social welfare model. If technology destroys some jobs, it will create others, they reckon, while training and state support will enable them to manage the transition.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the endurance of the Nordic model has long depended on two crucial elements — the public’s willingness to pay some of the highest taxes on earth, and the understanding that everyone is supposed to work. The state ensures that working-age people are prepared with the skills for high-wage jobs, in industries like technology and advanced manufacturing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sweden’s sharp influx of immigrants — the largest of any European nation, as a share of the overall population — directly tests this proposition.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the peak in 2015, 160,000 refugees sought asylum in Sweden, a country of 10 million people. That is equivalent to more than five million refugees arriving in the United States in a year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the last two decades, the share of foreign-born people has risen from 11 percent of the Swedish population to 19 percent. Many of the refugees have little education and do not speak Swedish, making them difficult to employ.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Public opinion surveys show that Swedes remain willing to accept their tax burden. But as citizens absorb the reality that many refugees will rely on welfare for years, some are balking at the cost while demanding limits on government aid for jobless people.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People are quite open to showing solidarity for people who are like themselves,” says Carl Melin, policy director at Futurion, a research institution in Stockholm. “They don’t show solidarity for people who are different.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The primary vessel of discontent is the Sweden Democrats, a right-wing political party with roots in the neo-Nazi movement. Over the last decade, the party has emerged from the extremist wilderness to secure mainstream status, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/09/world/europe/sweden-elections.html?module=inline" title="">last year capturing the third largest bloc of seats in Parliament</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The party has gained force amid anger over an economy that has stagnated in recent years, and frustration over cuts to social services that have been unfolding for a quarter-century.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The party has also been propelled by revulsion over multiculturalism in towns like Filipstad, where Muslim women in headscarves now wheel toddlers down sidewalks.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“These immigrants don’t speak the same language,” complains Mr. Pettersson, a Sweden Democrat, over coffee in a downtown cafe specializing in Swedish pastries. “They have different religions, different ways of life. If there are too many differences, it’s harder to get along. It’s interesting to meet someone from another country for maybe half an hour, but if you’re going to live together, it’s tough.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He favors sending refugees back to their home countries through “voluntary repatriation,” he says, rather than squandering public money on doomed efforts to integrate them.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t have infinite resources,” Mr. Pettersson says. “Either it’s higher taxes, or you have to cut something.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sweden has long had a reputation for welcoming the exiles of war. And it also claims distinction as the nation that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www2.compareyourcountry.org/oda?cr=oecd&amp;lg=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">spends the largest percentage of its wealth on aid for developing countries</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’ve seen ourselves as a superpower in terms of doing good things,” says Marten Blix, an economist at the Research Institute of Industrial Economics in Stockholm.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When the national government began bringing refugees to Filipstad in 2012, local officials received assurances they would not be left to fend for themselves.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The state was eager to put refugees in small towns rather than in cities like Stockholm, where housing was scarce and expensive. National authorities agreed to cover rent, food, clothing and specialized medical care for the first two years. After that, municipalities would inherit responsibility, though costs were assumed to be minimal: By then, most refugees would supposedly be able to support themselves.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That was a fantasy, says Hannes Fellsman.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He manages work and education programs at a unit the local government set up in 2015 to prepare refugees for careers. He and his colleagues quickly grasped this was going to require substantial resources.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Early waves of refugees from Syria and Iraq included doctors, accountants and other professionals. Language training allowed them to resume their careers. The people arriving later tended to have little education. Many had suffered trauma, requiring mental health counseling.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Roughly one-fifth of Filipstad’s nearly 11,000 inhabitants are now foreign-born. Among the 750 working-age people, 500 have received less than a high school education. Two hundred are illiterate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The state keeps saying we need to prepare people to get jobs fast,” Mr. Fellsman says. “That’s impossible. You have to educate them.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Preparing lower-skilled refugees for work would be a challenge anywhere. In Sweden it is uniquely difficult, given how the economy is centered on highly skilled, highly paid pursuits. It has been engineered to minimize the sorts of low-paying service sector jobs that consign people in other countries to the ranks of the working poor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some argue that Sweden must allow lower-wage service sector jobs to emerge, enabling immigrants to secure a hold in the economy by cleaning homes or taking care of children — ideally with a government subsidy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But unions are hostile, seeing this as a dangerous precedent that could expose Sweden to the forces of downward mobility at work in other countries. Until recently, Swedes were not accustomed to hiring people for menial work, typically preferring to clean their own homes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet absent some fresh approach to increasing employment, an alarming divide seems certain to widen.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The unemployment rate was only 3.8 percent among the Swedish-born populace last year, but 15 percent among foreign-born, notes Marika Lindgren Asbrink, a researcher at LO, Sweden’s largest labor union. Roughly half of all jobless people in Sweden were foreign-born.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among supporters of the Sweden Democrats, these sorts of numbers are cited as evidence that refugees have flocked here to enjoy lives of state-financed sloth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We have to demand that people work or they cannot get benefits,” says Ted Bondesson, a 22-year-old university student, as he celebrates Flag Day at a barbecue thrown by the Sweden Democrats in the southern town of Horby. “We can’t pay for the whole world.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The mayor of the town, Cecilia In Zito, a Sweden Democrat, says refugees have refused to assimilate. “I would start by forcing them to learn Swedish,” she says.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Such depictions astonish Babak Jamali.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Six years ago, when he was 13, he left his home in war-torn Afghanistan, riding in the trunk of a car through Pakistan and into Iran. There, he found construction jobs for about $2 a day, squatting in half-finished apartment blocks while struggling to evade police.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He paid a smuggler to truck him into Turkey. He rode buses up the Balkan Peninsula and eventually to Germany, where he slept on the floor of a mosque. He rode a train to the Swedish city of Malmo and applied for asylum. For the last year, he has lived with a pro-refugee activist in the fields outside Horby in a house heated by a wood stove and lacking plumbing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On paper, Mr. Jamali, 19, is the worst case for Sweden. Before arriving, he had no formal schooling, making him another illiterate, unskilled person ill-suited for work. But he chafes at the notion that he is a drain on society.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He cannot work while his asylum case is pending, so he goes into Horby six days a week to study Swedish. He walks 15 minutes up a dirt road to the highway, even in subzero temperatures, and then waits for a bus that takes 40 minutes. One bus driver refuses to pick him up. Swedes holler at him from passing cars, telling him to go home.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What home?” he says. “I have no home.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His first asylum claim was denied. He has filed an appeal. If he loses, he faces deportation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This possibility fills him with dread. If he lands back in Afghanistan, he will be just another jobless young person. In Sweden, he has become a full-time student, nearly fluent in Swedish, and keen to forge a career as an electrician.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I want to live the way other people live,” he says.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For most Swedes, the benefits of immigration remain intact. The Nordic model is proven, justifying taxpayer investments toward settling refugees, say economists. Many will struggle to work, but their children will grow up speaking Swedish. They will graduate from Swedish schools into jobs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Immigration doesn’t shake the Swedish welfare model in any way,” says Claes Hultgren, the municipal manager in Filipstad. “When we have succeeded with these people, this is a huge resource for Sweden.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The average refugee in Sweden receives about 74,000 Swedish kronor (about $7,800) more in government services than they pay into the system, Joakim Ruist, an economist at the University of Gothenburg, concluded in a report released last year and commissioned by the Ministry of Finance.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over all, the cost of social programs for refugees runs about 1 percent of Sweden’s annual national economic output, about as much as Sweden now spends on international aid. The economy is growing. The government’s finances are solid.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Sweden can bear this cost,” Mr. Ruist says. “This seemingly unsolvable refugee crisis is fully solvable.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Filipstad, refugee families of five and more are packed into apartments built for two. Local schools have seen multiplying reports of concern — anything from students missing class to evidence of hunger. Violent crime is increasing. So is drug use.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The job training unit represents an effort to arrest that trajectory.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On a recent morning, Saadia Osman sits in a classroom on the second floor of a government building overlooking a lake. She and 11 other refugees are learning Swedish tailored to work in a restaurant kitchen.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A mother of three, Ms. Osman, 39, arrived in Sweden six years ago, having fled the war in her native Somalia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At first, the government paid the 6,400 kronor a month rent (about $675) on their two-room apartment. It gave them money for food and clothing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her husband studied Swedish and attended city-run work trainings. Three years ago, he landed a job at a nearby factory that makes Swedish crisp bread, earning 20,000 kronor a month (about $2,100). They now pay their own rent. Ms. Osman, a preschool teacher in Somalia, wants her own job.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are all eager to work,” she says. “It’s not good to sit around at home and do nothing.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as the local government seeks to multiply such successes, it is operating with a shortage of money. Most refugees can study only part time.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t have the money for more,” says Mr. Fellsman.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Three years ago, the national government gave Filipstad 55 million kronor (about $5.8 million) to cover the extra costs of supporting refugees. That money runs out this year. National authorities recently approved plans for an additional $34 million in aid for local governments, less than initially proposed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sweden sits at a crossroads. Taxpayers can swallow the costs of integrating refugees, or reject that burden and risk a defining division: White, native-born Swedes will retain jobs and comfortable lives, while dark-skinned immigrants sink into poverty and joblessness in isolated ghettos.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are creating more and more hostility in our country,” says Dan Andersson, a former chief economist at LO. “We are creating an underclass of unskilled people, because we aren’t helping them with resources.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">From where Johnny Grahn sits, Sweden is already helping too much.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A bus driver by profession, he occupies a seat on the Filipstad government council, representing the Sweden Democrats. His face tightens at mention of the refugees. As he describes it, they have overwhelmed the community.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The mosque established in the former home of a prominent Swedish conservative intellectual, Sven Stolpe, rudely awakens neighbors with the call to prayer, Mr. Grahn complains. Local housing complexes are full of foreigners, he says, while preschools have been “inundated” with refugee children.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the greatest indignity is the impact on the local budget, Mr. Grahn says.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">People are waiting weeks to see dentists. The council recently cut a popular activity coordinator at a local senior center. At the same time, the local government’s welfare payments have soared over the past decade from 6 million kronor (about $632,00) to 29 million (more than $3 million).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To Mr. Grahn and his allies in the Sweden Democrat party, the takeaway is obvious: Refugees are absorbing an outsize share of resources, leaving less money for everyone else.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The services that you pay taxes for have been reduced drastically,” he says. “There is almost a collapse in the system. When there are so many people arriving who don’t work, the whole thing falls apart.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In fact, public dismay over cuts to government programs is an old story in Sweden, one that long predates the recent influx of refugees.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After an economic crisis in the early 1990s, Sweden lowered taxes and reduced spending, trimming unemployment benefits and pensions. Complaints about delays in the health care system have become legion, with wealthier people resorting to private insurance.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But that picture is complicated, involving history, the changing ideological whims of the electorate and the complexities of national programs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Filipstad, as in other communities, a simpler, readily identified culprit now takes blame for nearly every social problem — the refugees. Driving the narrative is an assumption shared widely among Sweden Democrats that money spent trying to integrate refugees is money wasted.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are taking in people who don’t want to learn Swedish and don’t want to enter society,” says Mr. Grahn. “Integration isn’t just about us helping them. They have to want it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beyond Sweden, this sort of thinking tears at the foundations of the Nordic model in an era of mass migration.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People’s willingness to continue paying the very high taxes needed to finance the social welfare programs is not something that can be taken for granted,” says Mr. Blix, the economist. “We are now beginning to see the emergence of some serious cracks.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To outsiders, the Nordic model may seem governed by benevolence, by a collectivist spirit that places value on ensuring that no one goes without fundamental needs like health care and housing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Sweden’s experience with refugees suggests a more pragmatic, even transactional conception of the social welfare state, a sort of membership club in which people pay dues for expected services. If too many people get the benefits for free — especially people who stand out as different from the majority — faith in the system is imperiled.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Before, we got something back,” Mr. Grahn says. “Now, we’re not getting back what we paid for.”</p>
