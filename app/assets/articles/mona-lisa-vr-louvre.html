<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">PARIS — <!-- -->Mona Lisa’s lingering smile remains the same, but she is getting a first-of-its-kind virtual makeover from the Louvre Museum, which has struggled this year with the <!-- --> popularity<!-- --> of Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece and the throngs of selfie-snapping tourists.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With a blockbuster Leonardo exhibition fast approaching, the Louvre and its production partners are fine-tuning a virtual reality tour with three-dimensional views of the portrait that look beyond the jostling crowds, the shatterproof glass case and the <!-- -->layers of varnish from restorations and the fading green patina.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The real oil on wood “Mona Lisa” was returned last week to the skylit Salle des États, to coincide with the Oct. 24 opening of an exhibition marking the quincentennial of the death in 1519 of Leonardo, master of the Italian Renaissance. During the summer, while the Salle des États was being renovated, the portrait was moved to the Galerie Médicis, which resulted in severe <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/arts/design/mona-lisa-louvre.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;module=inline" title="">overcrowding</a> because <!-- -->of limited access.<!-- --> Disappointed tourists complained about fleeting glimpses and barriers that kept them about 15 feet from the 30-inch-tall painting.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The virtual reality tour will be a more intimate encounter. The VR tour, designed to remedy the problem of crowds and distance, will be housed in a small gallery room near the main Leonardo exhibition and apart from the “Mona Lisa.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The gallery, equipped with 11 headset stations, will offer seven-minute virtual tours that begin <!-- -->in a familiar crush of visitors with mobile phones aloft.<!-- --> They lead through <!-- -->a gallery of paintings<!-- --> to the portrait of Mona Lisa, the wife of an <!-- -->Italian silk merchant.<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“She is seated, and spectators will be facing her like a conversation, face to face,” said Dominique de Font-Réaulx, the Louvre’s director of <!-- -->mediation <!-- -->and cultural programming.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In this virtual land of Leonardo, spectators eventually fly over a valley and jagged hills aboard a wing-flapping glider he sketched (and which appears in the traditional exhibition). Ms. de Font-Réaulx noted that the two curators of the main exhibition have researched all the historical information for the virtual tour narration, including the visual details of Mona Lisa and her surroundings — from the gentle wave of her hair to her velvet dress to the clay tiles of the loggias of 16th-century Florence.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The digital experiment is part of an ongoing effort to broaden the Louvre’s appeal, with France laying new plans to promote its art treasures with virtual reality tours and some lower-tech alternatives.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In September, <!-- -->Franck Riester, France’s minister of culture<!-- -->, unveiled a project to develop <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.culture.gouv.fr/Presse/Communiques-de-presse/Franck-Riester-ministre-de-la-Culture-annonce-le-deploiement-de-1-000-Micro-Folies-d-ici-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a thousand “micro-follies,”</a> or <!-- -->digital pop-up museums, <!-- -->over the next three years in rural and suburban locations — <!-- -->including movie theaters, libraries, social centers and even hair salons. <!-- -->France intends to spend 3 million euros to offer virtual reality and 2D digital tours to show off the masterworks of a dozen major Paris museums, including, potentially, the Louvre’s “Mona Lisa” tour.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not everyone is thrilled with this campaign to make virtual reality a more fundamental part of the museum experience. “I would prefer the Louvre to be involved with reality,” said Didier Rykner, a French art critic and founder of the website La Tribune de l’Art, who <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.latribunedelart.com/micro-folies-quand-la-realite-virtuelle-depasse-l-affliction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">argues</a> that the state’s money is better spent on art acquisitions and that the museum should concentrate on organizational issues to reduce crowding.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s patronizing. It’s disdain,” Mr. Rykner said. Everywhere in France, he added, there were “churches and monuments where you can find big art — like a Velázquez or a Caravaggio.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“With 3 million euros, you could buy three masterpieces that you could give to the museums in France, so it would be real art for real people,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But other major museums are already experimenting with <!-- -->VR<!-- --> and are pushing forward based on the results. Earlier this year, the <!-- -->Musée de l’Orangerie<!-- --> in Paris tried out a virtual reality <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.musee-orangerie.fr/en/article/vr-experience-claude-monet-water-lily-obsession" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">tour</a> inspired by Monet’s Water Lily series that plunged spectators into the artist’s virtual pond in his Giverny garden through animated <!-- -->snowfall and summer days.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The reactions of visitors impressed Louvre officials. “Not only young people were using it. There were people over 65, including my father, who is 83,” said Ms. de Font-Réaulx, of the Louvre. “It’s very interesting, and we are open to new displays. But it will not replace the works. The content is first. That’s very important to the Louvre.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HTC Vive Arts, which is donating its services to develop the Louvre’s “Mona Lisa” project, also coordinated the production of the Monet tour along with a VR program last year at the Tate Modern in London, <!-- -->created to accompany <!-- -->an exhibition devoted to Amedeo Modigliani.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There the curators used historical research to reimagine the interior of Modigliani’s 1919 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/modigliani/modigliani-vr-ochre-atelier?smid=nytcore-ios-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Paris studio</a> in vivid detail, <!-- -->down to a cigarette smoldering on the table and rain from a roof leak dripping into a bucket.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What was wonderful was that many people spent more time looking at the Modigliani self-portrait in the last room of the exhibition,” said Nancy Ireson, a curator of the Modigliani exhibition. “They understood what they were going to see. They stayed longer and had conversations about the portrait.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> Since that project, Ms. Ireson has moved on to the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia as a deputy director of collections. <!-- -->The Barnes has instituted a program that brings basic headsets to local libraries to promote its collection of Impressionist works, then offering <!-- -->free bus rides and museum tickets<!-- --> for the following week<!-- -->. About 50 percent of the participants have used the free passes, according to Ms. Ireson.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Paris museum officials are optimistic that the Louvre’s experiment will open the museum “to a new public, which is maybe not interested in artworks, but is interested in the experience of VR,” according to Ms. de Font-Réaulx, who notes that viewers will be able to download the tour from home and that it could also travel in the future as a pop-up exhibition for symposiums and salons.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In preparation for the October debut, the Louvre is taking steps to minimize lines to glimpse its virtual Mona Lisa. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://arts.vive.com/us/articles/projects/art-photography/mona_lisa_beyond_the_glass/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Reservations</a> are required.</p>
