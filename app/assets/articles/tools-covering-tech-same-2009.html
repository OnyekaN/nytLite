<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? John Herrman, a reporter for the Styles desk who covers the internet, discussed the tech he’s using.</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">What are your most important tech tools for doing your work?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’ve never really taken an inventory like this. It’s kind of depressing! </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’m looking back at a decade of doomed attempts to figure out a new work flow, to assemble just the right set of tools or to conjure some sort of productivity spirit out of the App Store, somehow — and not much stuck. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’m right back where I was in 2009: typing on a few-years-old MacBook, stressed out listening to my iPhone buzz away on my desk, typing into Gmail and a work chat window, making any remotely important calls on landlines and recording people with a little voice recorder. I guess I use my smartphone more? I suppose this makes some sense. We expect to be able to borrow the tech industry’s latest tools to monitor and investigate <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">the tech industry</em>. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that they’re not especially useful for this particular purpose! </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There’s one tool I added that I haven’t given up on, although using it can feel a bit like giving up: Simplenote. It’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/technology/personaltech/collecting-your-thoughts-is-good-organizing-them-is-even-better.html?module=inline" title="">a notes app</a> that is as close to a searchable pile of paper as you can get. You make a new note, type into it, and then you make another new note, and you type into that. You just do that forever until you have thousands of notes that you can sort in a few ways, but that aren’t really organized in any meaningful sense of the word. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’m sure there are people who tag their Simplenotes, or otherwise think of them in some sort of structured way, but I just add them to the heap and then search for names or words and see what comes up. It has turned out to be a really nice way to annotate the frequently, and I think intentionally, disorienting experience of being online. So I like Simplenote. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I appreciate Google Calendar for related reasons. It’s one of the many clocks missing from the casino wall.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">As someone who lives and breathes this stuff, which tech trends do you love and which do you hate?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’m trying and failing to “live and breathe this stuff” a bit less lately, and I don’t appreciate what seems to happen when I try. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Each time I step even an inch away from a service — let’s say not logging in to Facebook or Twitter for a while — I get this little reminder of what I actually mean to them. There’s a flood of messages, of fresh notifications, of humanoid emails with subject lines like “We miss you” or sort of unearned claims that my friends miss me, or whatever. They almost instantly abuse whatever privileges you had given them to contact you, because why wouldn’t they? </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is new territory for companies that are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/technology/facebook-emails-privacy-data.html?module=inline" title="">used to always growing</a>. It doesn’t bode so well for what might happen if or when any of them end up in real decline. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">So what about a tech trend that you think is good?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The best tech trend right now, broadly speaking, is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/facebook-libra-congress.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;section=Technology" title="">public hearings about Big Tech</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the surface, these are often vexing spectacles. I’ll grant that it’s frustrating to watch questioners seem to fumble with the details, or even basics, of tech issues, but it’s also good way to learn what lawmakers believe the underlying issues actually are. There are genuinely different approaches on display, and they hinge less on granular detail than on ideology. For example, some liberals tend to believe that platforms can ultimately be adjusted and fixed. Leftists may suggest they’re inherently problematic, and should reined in. Some on the right seem to think that a better Big Tech is simply a cowed Big Tech that has been made very aware of its particular grievances. Subject expertise can, and will, be adapted to these very different ends.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While it’s funny and galling that Congressman Morsecode accidentally called it “The Twitters,” can you really say you understand the first thing about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/technology/twitter-ban-speech-dehumanizing.html?module=inline" title="">what Twitter’s working definition of harassment is</a>? What <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/technology/twitter-free-speech-infowars.html?module=inline" title="">gets you barred</a> there? Sometimes the dumbest-sounding questions actually <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">are</em> the best ones, particularly when you’re dealing with companies that need us to accept information asymmetry as a business model. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">You often write about issues that technology has wrought. What do you think are some of the biggest tech problems, and how do you deal with them personally?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There isn’t a single such issue that doesn’t <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/internet-advertising-business.html?module=inline" title="">implicate advertising in some way</a>, and advertising is so deeply intertwined with the web and the rest of the consumer internet that it’s quite difficult, often by design, to conceive of a world in which it’s less important. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For example, I won’t tell everyone to block ads. It’s complicated, especially from these pages! But that’s what I do, in as many ways as possible. I exclude sites from my ad blockers as I deem necessary. This “whitelist” is pretty substantial, and mostly includes other news organizations. It’s an imperfect solution. I just don’t think exposure to advertising is a healthy default for any environment where we spend a lot of time.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Which tech platforms do you think wield the most power, and what should people do to ensure their data and overall lives are not beholden to Big Tech?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Amazon could really hold the world hostage on a moment’s notice, but I suppose Google could, too. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I don’t think there’s a data-hygienic way to use any of the ad-supported platforms. That’s part of the deal, and I think most suggestions otherwise are either mistaken or deliberate diversions and a waste of time. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facebook isn’t free; loss of privacy is just one of the costs. Uber is convenient for riders because of what it asks of drivers, of cities and of public roads. It’s not so hard to understand the benefits and costs of older technologies this way — cars poison the air, newspapers pulp trees — and it only benefits any moment’s “big tech” to exempt it from such interpretations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/movies/mubi-a-streaming-service-with-a-ticking-clock.html?module=inline" title="">Mubi</a>! It’s a streaming app that hosts 30 films at a time — a new one shows up every day, and the oldest one leaves. It’s like having a really good independent or repertory movie theater in your house, or on your phone. (You can also download movies for flights, or for when you’re keeping your phone offline.) You’ll probably treat it as if it were a real-life small movie theater, and not use it as much as you wish you would, but you’ll rarely regret it when you do. And it’s $11 a month.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">If you could tell people to do one thing today with their personal tech to improve their lives, what would it be? </strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Get a $20 shower radio, AM/FM. Ours looks like a fish and I use it almost every day, usually for news, sometimes for music. If you’re a morning shower person, don’t check your phone before you check your fish. If evening, no phones after. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A fully loaded smartphone is a perfectly greedy device; it has no respect for your time. This radio worked for me to get away from that.</p>
