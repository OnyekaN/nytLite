<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HONG KONG — Two Hong Kong police officers were arrested on Tuesday after a video appeared to show them hitting a 62-year-old man in the genitals, stomach and face while he was strapped to a gurney in a hospital in June. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The man was not a participant in the protests this summer that have often ended in violent showdowns with the police. A pro-democracy lawmaker who released the footage, Lam Cheuk-ting, said the man had been accused of attacking a police officer while drunk. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But protesters and their supporters tied the episode to one of their central grievances: that the Hong Kong police have used brutal tactics. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“These few months, so many protesters have been arrested by the police,” Mr. Lam said at a news conference on Tuesday, next to two of the man’s sons. “Among them, how many must have been subjected to similar or even more severe abuse? Any sensible person would raise this question.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">John Tse, a police spokesman, said at a news conference later Tuesday that the officers had been arrested on suspicion of assault. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We absolutely do not tolerate it if officers break the law while knowing the law,” he said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The video, filmed on a security camera at North District Hospital on June 26, showed the man with his limbs bound to a gurney in a small room, with two uniformed police officers standing over him. Another man, whom Mr. Lam identified as a plainclothes officer, is also present for part of the video.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Within 10 seconds of the uniformed officers’ arrival in the room, one of them slaps the man in the face. Over the next 21 minutes, they can be seen repeatedly using their batons, fists and open hands to beat the man. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Lam said the man was intoxicated at the time. Photos taken later showed the man with bruises and cuts in multiple places. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of the man’s sons filed a complaint after the incident. The police said on Tuesday that they began investigating the allegation then, but made little progress. They said they did not<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>ask the hospital for its security-camera footage because they were unaware that there had been a camera in the room.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The protests in Hong Kong, initially focused on legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, expanded to include accusations of police brutality after the police began using batons, pepper spray, rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse crowds. Nearly 2,000 tear gas canisters have been used in just over two months — including canisters fired inside a subway station and from a window of a skyscraper — and arrests have occasionally been bloody. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">[<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/18/world/asia/hong-kong-tear-gas.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">A Times review showed policing methods that experts described as indiscriminate and excessive.</em></a>]</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several independent, international groups — including the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24888&amp;LangID=E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">United Nations human rights office</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/08/hong-kong-police-should-exercise-restraint-avoid-escalating-violence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Amnesty International</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://t.co/v0hvDJuVPO?amp=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Human Rights Watch</a> — have accused the police of<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>excessive force and repeatedly failing to follow safety standards for the use of weapons like tear gas and bean bag rounds. They have echoed protesters’ calls for an independent investigation into the police’s conduct. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officers say they have acted with restraint against the protesters, some of whom have thrown bricks, Molotov cocktails and other projectiles at officers.
