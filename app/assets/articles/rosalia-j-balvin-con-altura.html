There she came across a clip of dialogue from the Dominican radio and television personality <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/mariachibudda/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Mariachi Budda</a> — a catchphrase that translates literally to “with altitude,” and would go on to give the song its name and attitude. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For Rosalía, 26, who was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/arts/music/rosalia-flamenco-el-mal-querer.html?module=inline" title="">trained as a flamenco musician</a> before updating that traditional sound on her breakthrough 2018 album “El Mal Querer,” releasing a reggaeton single was not exactly the next logical step. But in the latest episode of “Diary of a Song,” she and her collaborators discuss their processes and motivations, reveal the reggaeton legend they initially wanted on the song’s hook and explain why this current moment is so special for music en español. </p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Charo Henríquez contributed reporting.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">“Diary of a Song” provides an up-close, behind-the-scenes look at how pop music is made today, using archival material — voice memos, demo versions, text messages, emails, interviews and more — to tell the story behind the track. </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4CGYNsoW2iBe_JY8XeXiUQdr2GRFgY-Z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Subscribe to our YouTube channel</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em></p>
