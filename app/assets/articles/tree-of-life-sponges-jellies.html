<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Poriferans, better known as sponges, are squishy, stationary and filled with holes. Ctenophores, also called comb jellies, are soft blobs wreathed by feathery cilia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the past decade, the two groups have been caught up in a raging battle, at least in the pages of scientific journals. At stake is a noble place in evolutionary history: closest living analogue of the first-ever animal. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.190638" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">A new analysis, published Wednesday in Royal Society Open Science</a>, hands victory back to the sponges<!-- -->,<!-- --> although more bouts are sure to come.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All animals, from sponges and comb jellies to humans and other mammals, have particular characteristics in common: We’re multicellular, our cells have nuclei and we consume food rather than make it. We also all have a common ancestor, which inhabited the oceans at least 550 million years ago and shared those traits. But no one knows for sure what that first animal looked like, or how it lived.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That’s why scientists look at existing species to shed light on the founder of the animal kingdom.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“By comparing modern animals, we’re trying to infer what the ancestor was like,” said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/rokaslab/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Antonis Rokas</a>, an evolutionary biologist at Vanderbilt University. “How complex was it? What kind of genes did it have, and what kinds of traits?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For years, most researchers agreed that sponges were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/science/14creatures.html?module=inline" title="">the sister group</a> of the first animals, suggesting a simpler, spongier forebear. But in 2008, a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18322464" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">genetic analysis</a> pointed to the comb jellies instead. Since then, a number of experts, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0126" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">including Dr. Rokas</a>, have also found support for the comb jellies theory, while <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://sciencenode.org/feature/sponges-vs-comb-jellies-which-are-most-ancient.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">other new genetic studies</a> still point to the sponges.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://snm.ku.dk/people/cnielsen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Claus Nielsen</a>, a morphologist affiliated with the Natural History Museum of Denmark and author of the new paper, has followed this controversy, which has unfolded entirely during his retirement, with great interest.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m 81 years old, and I’ve been a zoologist since my 20s,” he said. “My whole concept of the animal kingdom would crash with this ctenophores-first idea.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Nielsen decided to take a morphological approach to the question.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think about living organisms,” he said. “I think about how they function, how they react to the environment, how they eat, how they reproduce and so on.” He combed through about a thousand papers on poriferans, ctenophores and their relatives, and squeezed out relevant information about their anatomical and molecular characteristics. He then took two possible evolutionary scenarios — one in which poriferans branched off first, and the other in which ctenophores did — and elucidated which traits the relevant groups would have gained and lost on each path.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The two tell two very different stories. Sponges don’t move quickly, and are only able to eat tiny particles. So the poriferans-first scenario involves a gradual increase in complexity, as later groups gain things like digestive and nervous systems.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By contrast, comb jellies already have nervous systems, and can eat krill, amphipods and even each other. If the ctenophores evolved first, that would mean the sponges gave those things up.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“To lose the ability to digest larger organisms — to me, that is nonsense,” said Dr. Nielsen.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many disagree. Joseph Ryan of the University of Florida, who thinks ctenophores came first, argued that evolutionary trees based on even the most careful morphological studies are often less rigorous and objective than ones based on genetic data, and that the scenarios that seem impossible to Dr. Nielsen are as feasible as those presented in his study.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“All lineages are continuously evolving,” Dr. Ryan said, adding that loss of traits is common in evolution.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Rokas agreed: “What appear as major morphological transitions” can require “relatively simple changes in molecular terms.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Nielsen replied that phylogenetic studies also involve subjective choice, and that the loss of a useful trait goes against natural selection.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the battle rages, deeper issues rise to the surface. The controversy is “bigger than the usual questions that biologists investigate,” said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/earthsciences/people/davide-pisani/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Davide Pisani</a>, a professor phylogenomics at the University of Bristol in England. “Take the nervous system: this is the key system that is ultimately responsible for our own consciousness. When and how many times did it evolve?” The answer, he said, “has ramifications that transcend science and move to philosophy.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Nielsen, too, is fueled by a broader concern.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If you only look at the molecules and don’t think about morphology, and the function of organisms, then I would say it’s not biology any longer,” he said. “I know some people won’t like me to say that. But that’s the way I think.”</p>
