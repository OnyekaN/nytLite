In this series, The Times is going back to the scene of major news events to see if those promises were kept.</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">LONDON<!-- --> — When fire broke out at Grenfell Tower in London, the flames were whisked through the 24-story structure with astonishing speed, killing 72 people in Britain’s deadliest housing fire since World War II.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outrage spread quickly when Britons learned the cheap cladding that shrouded the tower had turned it into a death trap. Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to an enraged nation that “no stone will be left unturned” to make sure the disaster never repeated itself. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nearly two years after the Grenfell fire in June 2017, this is what we found of the government’s efforts, which have left tens of thousands of people at risk:</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">About 16,000 private apartments are still wrapped in the kind of exterior cladding that fed the Grenfell fire.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Their owners feel trapped in tinderboxes they cannot sell, and some residents have <!-- -->felt compelled<!-- --> to join round-the-clock patrols of their buildings, always on guard for a spark or whiff of smoke.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">The government did move fairly quickly to strip the dangerous cladding from public housing towers, but people in approximately 8,400 public apartments await a full repair.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Many of the business-friendly regulations that allowed Grenfell to be built on the cheap remain in place, despite a promise to rethink them top to bottom.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">The government has been slow to look at other types of flammable coverings that may be putting at least 340 additional apartment towers in <!-- -->danger<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">The Problem</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A year before the fire, contractors re-clad Grenfell Tower with a form of low-cost aluminum paneling<!-- -->. The cladding was banned in the United States and many European countries because if a fire breaks out, it allows the flames to spread quickly.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But English building rules were more lenient. As long as the cladding’s surface — the aluminum — was nonflammable, it mattered less what was inside. In this case, that meant a middle layer of plastic that amounted to a sheet of solidified fuel.</p><p>Radiant heat from the burning cladding and insulation, combined with air rushing through the gap, increased the intensity of the fire.</p><p class="g-pstyle0">Layers of the wall</p><p class="g-pstyle1">CAVITY</p><p class="g-pstyle2">OLD WALL</p><p class="g-pstyle3">CLADDING</p><p class="g-pstyle3">PANELS WITH </p><p class="g-pstyle3">PLASTIC CORE</p><p class="g-pstyle4">Exterior</p><p class="g-pstyle4">Interior</p><p class="g-pstyle0">A chimney effect</p><p class="g-pstyle1">INSULATION</p><p class="g-pstyle1">OLD WALL</p><p class="g-pstyle5">CAVITY,</p><p class="g-pstyle6">ABOUT </p><p class="g-pstyle7">2 INCHES</p><p class="g-pstyle8">AIR</p><p>Radiant heat from the burning cladding and insulation, combined with air rushing through the gap, increased the intensity of the fire.</p><p class="g-pstyle0">Layers of the wall</p><p class="g-pstyle0">A chimney effect</p><p class="g-pstyle1">INSULATION</p><p class="g-pstyle2">CAVITY,</p><p class="g-pstyle3">ABOUT </p><p class="g-pstyle4">2 INCHES</p><p class="g-pstyle1">OLD WALL</p><p class="g-pstyle1">CAVITY</p><p class="g-pstyle5">CLADDING</p><p class="g-pstyle5">PANELS WITH </p><p class="g-pstyle5">PLASTIC CORE</p><p class="g-pstyle6">OLD WALL</p><p class="g-pstyle7">Exterior</p><p class="g-pstyle7">Interior</p><p class="g-pstyle1">INSULATION</p><p class="g-pstyle8">AIR</p><p class="g-pstyle7">CROSS SECTION OF THE WALL</p><p>Radiant heat from the burning cladding and insulation, combined with air rushing through the gap, increased the intensity of the fire.</p><p class="g-pstyle0">Layers of the wall</p><p class="g-pstyle0">A chimney effect</p><p class="g-pstyle1">INSULATION</p><p class="g-pstyle1">OLD WALL</p><p class="g-pstyle2">CAVITY,</p><p class="g-pstyle3">ABOUT </p><p class="g-pstyle2">2 INCHES</p><p class="g-pstyle1">CAVITY</p><p class="g-pstyle4">OLD WALL</p><p class="g-pstyle5">CLADDING</p><p class="g-pstyle5">PANELS WITH </p><p class="g-pstyle5">PLASTIC CORE</p><p class="g-pstyle6">Interior</p><p class="g-pstyle6">Exterior</p><p class="g-pstyle1">INSULATION</p><p class="g-pstyle7">AIR</p><p class="g-pstyle6">CROSS SECTION OF THE WALL</p><p class="g-pstyle0">CAVITY,</p><p class="g-pstyle1">ABOUT </p><p class="g-pstyle2">2 INCHES</p><p class="css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit" data-testid="credit" id="interactive-credit">By Mika Gröndahl</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Grenfell caught fire after a refrigerator exploded on a lower floor, the plastic layer ignited and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/24/world/europe/grenfell-tower-london-fire.html?module=inline" title="">flames bolted up the side of the building</a>, dooming many of the residents. The public housing block was soon incinerated, and its scorched shell still looms over London.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To many, the disaster was an indictment of a decades-long anti-regulatory crusade in Britain.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Led by Margaret Thatcher, successive British governments diluted hundreds of pages of detailed building rules into much vaguer benchmarks; let private companies take over inspection work; and then, in the mid-2000s, opened the door to flammable cladding with small changes to the guidelines, experts said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Grenfell fire was viewed as a watershed. Top officials promised major changes. The commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, Dany Cotton, called it a “turning point” in the country’s approach to building safety.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Inspectors began searching for high-rise apartment buildings with Grenfell-style cladding. They found 433 and ordered it removed.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">What We Found</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But by April of this year, fewer than 100 of the buildings ordered fixed had been taken care of, with 338 of them still bearing flammable aluminum cladding. Living in them has meant daily torment.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If you think about it all the time, you just go mental,” said Rachel Guy, whose 10-story, privately owned South London apartment building is partly wrapped in the same combustible sandwich of aluminum and plastic used at Grenfell. “You’re living in a building that’s fundamentally unsafe.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A firefighter told Ms. Guy a fire could send flames from the bottom to top of the building within seven minutes. She worried that her mother, 81, would never make it downstairs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government did soon direct 400 million pounds, or $523 million, to help the local authorities remove the cladding from approximately 150 public housing blocks. That work is happening, if at a pace slower than some might have wanted: A third of the buildings have been fixed, half are mid-repair, and almost all the rest have retrofitting plans in place.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But nobody wanted to pay to remove the cladding from privately owned high-rises.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In England, most private apartments are sold as long-term leases, with the building itself owned by a “freeholder,” often an investment group. The law made it difficult for either residents or the government to hold these building owners liable for the cladding.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In fact, the owners of private buildings like Ms. Guy’s were pressing residents to pay to replace it. The bill at her building came to 70,000 pounds, or $89,000, per flat: an impossible amount for many.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While residents resisted paying for the repairs, there were other costs they couldn’t avoid. Among them were round-the-clock patrols, mandated by local fire brigades, that are supposed to protect people from their building’s flammable skin.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Guy, a retired English teacher, paces the hallways of her building three times a week while her neighbors sleep, peering into garbage chutes and sniffing for smoke. Even with residents like Ms. Guy taking on shifts for subminimum wages, the patrols cost residents about 200,000 pounds a year.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">What We Found</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the most part, it is not luxury apartment towers, but buildings filled with first-time buyers, retirees, working-class people and immigrants that have shouldered the burden of combustible cladding.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I haven't seen 20,000 pounds since I scrimped and saved to purchase my property,” said William Martin, a medical student in Sheffield who was told each apartment had to pay that sum to fix his building’s <!-- --> cladding. “My building is still wrapped in what is the most dangerous material known to man, considering what happened at Grenfell.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unable to sell or remortgage his property, he added: “I’m basically stuck in this nightmare.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The financial and psychological stress is taking a heavy toll. A survey carried out by a coalition of affected tenants found scores of people saying they felt daily anxiety. Home, once a refuge, started to feel like a cage.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After failing to persuade building owners to pay for the cladding repairs themselves, the government this month allocated about $254 million for the work.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new fund was a relief, but hardly a cure-all.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Residents are still on the hook for stopgap safety measures, like new alarms and building patrols. Because the repairs are complicated and specialists are in short supply, waits for fixes could be long, possibly stretching for years.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And the Grenfell-style cladding covered by the government fund is hardly the only fire propellant lining the sides of English high-rises.</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">What We Found </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Guy’s high-rise is covered in a tapestry of flammable cladding, not just the Grenfell type.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among them is a particularly dangerous, widespread variety called high-pressure laminate, or HPL. It emits more smoke and ignites even faster than aluminum cladding. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Nobody took any notice of it,” said Richard Hull, a fire science professor at the University of Central Lancashire. “The next Grenfell tragedy is more likely to be on an HPL-clad building because there’s a hell of a lot more of them, and no action’s been taken to do anything about it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HPL is banned from new buildings, but the government has left it on existing ones.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And HPL is not the only other cladding causing worry. An insulation maker, Rockwool, has estimated 340 recently built high-rise complexes use flammable cladding different from the kind on Grenfell. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government says tests on different kinds of dangerous cladding like HPL began last month, though experts have raised concerns about the tests’ reliability.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Katie Peate lives in a building in Manchester covered in timber cladding and an insulation system that residents were told was more combustible than Grenfell’s. Her building owner wants residents to pay for repairs, at a cost of up to 80,000 pounds per flat. The government fund covers none of it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beyond apartment towers, more than 1,300 vulnerable buildings like hospitals, care homes, schools and hotels have flammable exteriors, Rockwool estimates, but are exempt from having to strip it because they are not high-rises.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The big worry now is the government is going to think this is job done,” Ms. Peate said. “They didn’t realize they were going to open this can of worms.”</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">What We Found</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Grenfell exposed a broken system of building safety, where lax construction regulation let developers “race to the bottom,” according to a government-ordered review conducted after the disaster.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Prime Minister May held up the government’s response to Grenfell in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/world/europe/may-speech.html?module=inline" title="">her resignation speech</a> last week as one of the biggest achievements of her tenure.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But many others saw it differently, with a firefighters’ union calling it “disgraceful” that Mrs. May celebrated efforts that have left lax building rules untouched and tens of thousands of people in danger. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/707785/Building_a_Safer_Future_-_web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The recommendations of the regulatory review</a>, presented to Parliament a year ago, disappointed many safety experts who had seen it as a golden opportunity for an overhaul<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It did not recommend that fire sprinklers be installed on existing high-rises or on new buildings below 10 stories. It did not ask for a new mandate on second staircases for escaping blazes, which remain optional in many cases, too. And the government’s ban on Grenfell-style cladding applies only to buildings above 18 meters, or about six stories.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For many fire safety experts, those were head-spinning decisions, signaling an inability — or unwillingness — to reshape the regulatory landscape to prioritize safety over cost.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The government’s primary objective has always been to avoid the blame for Grenfell,” said Jonathan Evans, the chief executive of Ash and Lacy, a cladding systems maker. Writing strict new rules, he said, would have been an admission the old ones had allowed Grenfell-style cladding to proliferate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government said it was still considering tougher rules about fire sprinklers and evacuation staircases, and that it had focused on buildings above six stories because firefighting becomes riskier at those heights.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is nothing more important than making sure people are safe in their homes, and that’s why the government is committed to improving building safety,” a Housing Ministry spokesman said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other measures recommended in the report, like harsher penalties and a new regulatory body with greater oversight powers, have won plaudits, but require parliamentary action that has yet to happen.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Safety experts said they were especially concerned about how little has been done since Grenfell to protect the disabled and elderly, who cannot easily escape burning buildings. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s only a matter of time before we’ll get a vulnerable group that will die in large numbers,” said Jonathan O’Neill, the managing director of the Fire Protection Association, Britain’s national fire safety organization. “I’m absolutely convinced about it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The Takeaway</strong>: Someone always pays for building on the cheap.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Additional sources not cited in the article: Susan Bright, professor of land law at Oxford University; Stuart Hodkinson, associate professor in critical urban geography at University of Leeds; Alistair Murray, director and leader of fire engineering team at Arup; Giles Peaker, housing lawyer and partner at Anthony Gold Solicitors; Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London; Ritu Saha, co-founder of U.K. Cladding Action Group; Arnold Tarling, chartered surveyor at BETA - Chartered Surveyors Ltd.</p>
