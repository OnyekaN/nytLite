<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even as the San Francisco 49ers improved to 6-0, matching New England for the best record in the N.F.L., Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers made it clear that they should be in the conversation as one of the league’s best teams. Week 7 offered quite a bit of scoring — outside of San Francisco’s nearly unwatchable win over Washington. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here’s what we learned:</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Aaron Rodgers is starting to get comfortable — which should terrify everyone.</strong> Playing without Mike McCarthy’s guidance for the first time in his career, Rodgers looked tentative — at least by his standards — during the Packers’ 5-1 start, with Green Bay cracking 30 points just once. In Week 7, the training wheels of Coach Matt LaFleur’s offense appeared to come off: Rodgers threw for 429 yards and five touchdowns (to five different receivers) while running in a score as well. He had the second perfect 158.3 passer rating in Green Bay history — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/sports/bart-starr-packers-super-bowls.html" title="">Bart Starr</a> managed the feat in 1960, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/196012170ram.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">but on just nine attempts</a> — and according to Pro Football Reference, Rodgers was the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://pfref.com/tiny/Ug24Z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">first N.F.L. player since Mark Rypien in 1991</a> to have five passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in the same game.</p><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another Sunday, another great showing from the Faithful. <br/><br/>Thanks for sticking it out with us in the rain! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoNiners?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GoNiners</a> <a href="https://t.co/2lfuNOkTse">pic.twitter.com/2lfuNOkTse</a></p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Every 49ers game is, apparently, a home game.</strong> A week after seas of red jerseys made Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum look like Levi’s Stadium South, the 49ers spoiled Washington’s “Homecoming Weekend” by spending the second half of a rainy and muddy win being serenaded with chants of “Let’s Go Niners!” San Francisco is 6-0 for the first time since 1990 and just the third time in franchise history. The Upshot’s N.F.L. Playoff Simulator currently gives them a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/upshot/nfl-playoff-picture.html" title="">13 percent chance</a> of getting to the Super Bowl this year, which trails only New England’s 20 percent.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Russell Wilson picked a bad day to make his first mistake.</strong> Seattle’s 5-1 start to the season was largely powered by Wilson’s near perfection at quarterback. On Sunday he faltered, throwing his first interception of the season and having the newest Baltimore Raven, Marcus Peters, promptly run it back for a pick-six. Lamar Jackson and Baltimore smelled blood and they never relented, coming away with an impressive 30-16 victory. Jackson surpassed 100 rushing yards for the second consecutive game, and with three such games this season, he is tied with Billy Kilmer, Michael Vick and Wilson for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://pfref.com/tiny/ZvTPJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the most by a quarterback in a single season since at least 1950</a>. His team has nine games left to play.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Drew Brees has gotten a </strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">lot</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> of help from his friends.</strong> The Saints could easily have folded when Brees, their quarterback for all but three games since 2006, injured his thumb in Week 2. Instead they have gone 5-0 since the injury, with Teddy Bridgewater steering the ship admirably. On Sunday, the team’s third quarterback, Taysom Hill, got in on the action, rushing for 21 yards and catching a 4-yard touchdown pass from Bridgewater. Brees could potentially return next week against Arizona, but he could easily wait until after the team’s Week 9 bye instead, as Bridgewater, Hill and the rest of the Saints have New Orleans leading the N.F.C. South at 6-1.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Chandler Jones has Daniel Jones figured out.</strong> Arizona’s defense was in the middle of the pack with 14 sacks as a team coming into <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/sports/football/giants-cardinals-score.html" title="">this week’s win over the Giants</a>. Pinning their ears back against a rookie quarterback added eight to that total, with Chandler Jones, a standout linebacker, accounting for a career-high four. Jones also forced one of Daniel Jones’s two lost fumbles, continuing a rapid decline for the Giants’ <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/sports/football/daniel-jones-eli-manning-giants-quarterback.html" title="">quarterback</a> who has followed up his <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/22/sports/football/giants-daniel-jones.html" title="">electric debut</a> as a starter against Tampa Bay by going 1-3 since, with four passing touchdowns and nine turnovers. Arizona’s Kyler Murray, meanwhile, started the season poorly but has now won three straight.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">You’re not reading the chart upside down, Aaron Rodgers was definitely the best quarterback in the N.F.L. this week. But Tannehill, who was promoted to starter for Tennessee this week, went out and had one of the best games of his career, making a lot of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/sports/football/nfl-picks-week-7.html?module=inline" title="">newspaper prediction columns</a> look awfully foolish. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kirk Cousins also deserves special mention for becoming just the second player to record three consecutive games with more than 300 passing yards and a rating higher than 130. The first was Patrick Mahomes who did it in Weeks 1 to 3 of this season.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With Carolina’s Christian McCaffrey and Cleveland’s Nick Chubb both on bye weeks, Cook took sole possession of the league’s rushing lead with 725 yards. His average of 103.6 a game just barely tops McCaffrey’s 103. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stefon Diggs of the Vikings led the league in receiving yards for a second consecutive week, but Green Bay’s Valdes-Scantling scored a 74-yard touchdown and was the league’s third-leading receiver despite catching just two passes. <!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">*Except when it takes two.</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Colts 30, Texans 23 </strong>“It just says he’s legit, he’s the man,” Coach Frank Reich said of Jacoby Brissett’s 326-yard, four-touchdown performance.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Ravens 30, Seahawks 16 </strong>In his return to Seattle, Earl Thomas shared an emotional hug with Russell Wilson following Baltimore’s win — and then <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1186070490189881351" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ran off the field waving Wilson’s jersey over his head</a> in triumph.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Saints 36, Bears 25</strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em>The game was nowhere near as close as the final score would have you believe.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Cowboys 37, Eagles 10</strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em>A three-game losing streak for the Cowboys was troubling, but a good day all-around for Dallas has the team back in sole possession of first place in the N.F.C.
