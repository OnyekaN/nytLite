<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">School busing has for decades been a contentious tool for racial integration. And it is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-busing.html?module=inline" title="">back in the spotlight</a> 65 years after Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court’s landmark decision to desegregate public schools, because Senator Kamala Harris of California recently attacked former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for his position on busing. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since the issue resurfaced in June in the first set of Democratic presidential debates, The New York Times has unearthed and reviewed more than four decades of Mr. Biden’s voting record and statements about the issue. You can read <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html?module=inline" title="">the full result of that investigation </a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/biden-busing.html?module=inline" title="">here</a>. Below is a brief timeline of highlights. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">1974:</strong> Mr. Biden, who was then a senator for Delaware, voted two times to protect <!-- -->court-ordered <!-- -->busing to achieve desegregation, including the decisive vote on an amendment that would have effectively done away with it. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But months after an angry crowd in a school auditorium criticized him for that vote, Mr. Biden said in a speech on the Senate floor that he had become “more and more disenchanted with busing as a remedy.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">1975</strong>: Mr. Biden joined Senator Jesse Helms, a Republican segregationist from North Carolina, in supporting an anti-busing amendment to an education spending bill. When the amendment failed, Mr. Biden <!-- -->wrote <!-- -->a narrower measure that prevented schools from using federal dollars to assign teachers or students by race. It passed, 50-43.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a television interview, Mr. Biden called busing an “asinine concept” and said he had “gotten to the point where I think our only recourse to eliminate busing may be a constitutional amendment.” As an alternative, he argued for putting “more money into the black schools” and opening up housing patterns, warning that otherwise “we are going to end up with the races at war.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You take people who aren’t racist, people who are good citizens, who believe in equal education and opportunity, and you stunt their children’s intellectual growth by busing them to an inferior school and you’re going to fill them with hatred,” he said in the interview. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The new integration plans being offered are really just quota systems to assure a certain number of blacks, Chicanos or whatever in each school. That, to me, is the most racist concept you can come up with.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What it says is, in order for your child with curly black hair, brown eyes and dark skin to be able to learn anything, he needs to sit next to my blond-haired, blue-eyed son. That’s racist! Who the hell do we think we are, that the only way a black man or woman can learn is if they rub shoulders with my white child?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">1976: </strong>Mr. Biden introduced legislation to prevent the Justice Department from pursuing desegregation cases that could result in court-ordered busing. “I oppose busing, to the chagrin of some of my liberal colleagues,” he said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The same year, Mr. Biden supported several bills designed to limit the power of federal judges who could issue busing orders. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">1981-82:</strong> Mr. Biden partnered with Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina and another staunch segregationist, to introduce a provision into the Justice Department’s spending bill that effectively barred federal courts from issuing busing orders. It passed the Senate but died in the House.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During a Senate hearing, Mr. Biden said no issue had “consumed more of my time and energies” than busing during his first eight years in office. “We want to stop court-ordered busing” without undoing the Brown ruling, he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">2007: </strong>In his memoir “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3SqRQnn4IykC&amp;q=busing#v=snippet&amp;q=busing&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics</a>,” Mr. Biden revisited busing in Delaware in the 1970s. He called the matter a “liberal train wreck” that was “tearing people apart,” and said that both black and white parents were “terrified.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Busing ended in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden’s hometown, in 1995 after 17 years of federally mandated measures. The state has since passed a law saying children should attend the schools closest to their homes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">June 27:</strong> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-busing-joe-biden.html?module=inline" title="">Ms. Harris challenged Mr. Biden directly</a> about his position on busing during the first Democratic debates, saying his alliances with segregationists were especially “hurtful” to her as a black woman who had been bused to integrate schools in Northern California. Afterward, on MSNBC, Mr. Biden <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/06/27/biden_kamala_harris_mischaracterized_my_position_frustrating_to_relitigate_in_2019.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said his position had been “mischaracterized.”</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I supported busing to eliminate de jure segregation,” he said, meaning segregation imposed by law, as opposed to “de facto” segregation, which occurs because of segregated housing patterns, for example. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">June 28:</strong> At a conference in Chicago, Mr. Biden <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/us/politics/joe-biden-busing-kamala-harris.html?module=inline" title="">repeated his defense</a>, saying, “I’ve always been in favor of using federal authority to overcome state-initiated segregation.” He also drew a distinction between court-ordered busing and programs initiated by local communities. “I never, never, never ever opposed voluntary busing,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">July 5:</strong> Mr. Biden <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1907/05/nday.05.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">told CNN</a> that he thought busing did not work. “You had overwhelming response from the African-American community in my state,” he said, adding, “They did not support it.”</p>
