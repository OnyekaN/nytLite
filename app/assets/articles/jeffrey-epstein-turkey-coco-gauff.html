That deal was overseen by Alexander Acosta, then the U.S. attorney in Miami and now President Trump’s labor secretary.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the indictment was released, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, called for Mr. Acosta to resign. Attorney General William Barr recused himself from the case, saying his former law firm had represented Mr. Epstein.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Closer look: </strong>Photographs of Woody Allen, former President Bill Clinton and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-nyc-mansion.html?module=inline" title="">hang in Mr. Epstein’s $56 million home</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Opinion: </strong>Michelle Goldberg writes that Mr. Epstein’s case “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/opinion/jeffrey-epstein-trump.html?module=inline" title="">reveals a deep corruption among mostly male elites across parties</a>, and the way the very rich can often purchase impunity for even the most loathsome of crimes.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A federal appeals court panel will hear arguments today on whether a federal judge in Texas was right to strike down the Affordable Care Act. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/health/obamacare-appeals-court.html?module=inline" title="">The case, which could end up at the Supreme Court</a>, threatens insurance protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The battle is being fought with the 2020 elections as a backdrop, and the case already features in Democratic ads targeting President Trump and other Republicans.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The background: </strong><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/health/obamacare-unconstitutional-texas-judge.html?module=inline" title="">Republican state officials filed the initial suit</a> against the federal government, and the Trump administration has declined to offer a defense. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Related:</strong> A federal judge ruled on Monday that the Trump administration could not force pharmaceutical companies to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/health/drug-prices-tv-ads-trump.html?module=inline" title="">disclose the list prices of their drugs in television ads</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In North Carolina today, the pediatrician Joan Perry, above, is in a Republican primary runoff for a congressional seat.

The surge is happening partly because Republicans watched Democratic women make historic gains last year and decided to adopt a similar strategy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Democrats: </strong>Tom Steyer, a California billionaire and activist, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/steyer-swalwell-2020.html?module=inline" title="">may enter the 2020 presidential contest today</a>, a day after a fellow Californian, Representative Eric Swalwell, said he was ending his own bid for the nomination.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the past few years, a portion of Buddhists have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/world/asia/buddhism-militant-rise.html?module=inline" title="">waged deadly attacks against minority Muslim populations</a>, particularly in Sri Lanka and Myanmar. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The sense of grievance from followers of a generally pacifist religion might seem unlikely: In both countries, Buddhists constitute overwhelming majorities of the population. But some, especially those who subscribe to the purist Theravada strain of the faith, are increasingly convinced that they are under existential threat, particularly from an Islam struggling with its own violent fringe.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Quote of note: </strong>“Buddhist monks will say that they would never condone violence,” an anthropologist said. “But at the same time, they will also say that Buddhism or Buddhist states have to be defended by any means.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facial recognition software can return more false matches for African-Americans than for white people, studies show, an effect experts call “algorithmic bias.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A debate over police use of the technology in Detroit, whose share of black residents is larger than in any other sizable American city, underscores <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/detroit-facial-recognition-cameras.html?module=inline" title="">a broader reckoning over surveillance</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Afghanistan talks:</strong> Representatives from the Taliban and the country’s government, meeting for a second day in Qatar, agreed today to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-peace-talks.html?module=inline" title="">a basic road map for negotiating a path to peace</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Turkey’s economic crisis: </strong>The lira <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/business/turkey-economy-crisis.html?module=inline" title="">lost more than 3 percent of its value against the dollar</a> in early trading in Asia on Monday,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan abruptly dismissed the central bank governor over the weekend.<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Cross-Atlantic strain:</strong> President Trump said on Monday that the White House would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/donald-trump-kim-darroch.html?module=inline" title="">no longer deal with Britain’s ambassador to the U.S</a>., after the leaking of confidential cables in which the envoy described the Trump administration as “clumsy and inept.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Elizabeth Warren’s fund-raising:</strong> The Massachusetts senator <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-fundraising.html?module=inline" title="">raised $19.1 million in the second quarter</a> for her presidential bid, ahead of her main progressive rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Census fight: </strong>Attorney General William Barr <!-- -->said that he believed the Trump administration could find a legal path to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/us/politics/william-barr-census-citizenship.html?module=inline" title="">placing a citizenship question on the 2020 count</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Snapshot: </strong>Above, the American astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the moon in 1969.
