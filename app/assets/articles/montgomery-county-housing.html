<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The agenda said the Montgomery County Council would vote on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/COUNCIL/Resources/Files/zta/2019/ZTA%2019-01.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">an ordinance</a> allowing homeowners in the county, a wealthy Maryland suburb of Washington, D.C., to create basement or backyard apartments, a modest proposal to ease a crucial shortage of affordable housing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The protesters who filled the front rows of the Council chambers last week thought they knew better. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is not about providing affordable housing,” said Hessie Harris, a 70-year-old homeowner. “The goal is to do away with single-family communities. They claim these are going to be in-law suites and then there goes the neighborhood! They could put in flophouses!”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ellen Paul, 59, said in-law suites were bad enough: “It’s changing suburbia to allow two homes on each lot. You’ll have strangers walking by your house all the time now.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their fellow protesters were at pains to emphasize that they were less concerned about their own affluent neighborhoods than about the residents of less affluent neighborhoods. The wealthier parts of Montgomery County have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/03/05/judge-dismisses-second-lawsuit-against-purple-line-project/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.991ce53f50a6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">demonstrated a willingness</a> to hire expensive lawyers to fight development. But who was going to look out for people who lack the resources to use the court system to endlessly delay projects they don’t like?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s where the backyard trailers are going to go,” said Dale Barnhard, one of the more than 1,500 people who signed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.change.org/p/montgomery-county-council-protect-single-family-home-zoning-in-montgomery-county-maryland" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a petition opposing the “dramatic” change in rules</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And not just trailers. One protester insisted that people could set up shipping containers in their backyards. “Boxcars,” said another — with lights and music on all night. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/montgomery-votes-unanimously-to-loosen-regulations-for-adus-bringing-temporary-close-to-months-long-debate/2019/07/23/db621c10-ad4d-11e9-bc5c-e73b603e7f38_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Council approved the new rules unanimously</a>, making Montgomery County one of the largest jurisdictions to embrace what planners call “accessory dwelling units.” California passed a law in 2016 making it easier to add an apartment to a single-family home. In the following year, permits in Los Angeles <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://magazine.realtor/home-and-design/feature/article/2018/07/the-rise-of-the-accessory-dwelling-unit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">jumped to nearly 2,000, </a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://magazine.realtor/home-and-design/feature/article/2018/07/the-rise-of-the-accessory-dwelling-unit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">from 90</a>. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/opinion/sunday/minneapolis-ends-single-family-zoning.html?module=inline" title="">Minneapolis</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-city-council-oks-more-and-larger-backyard-cottages-restricts-mcmansions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Seattle</a>, neighboring Washington, D.C., and other cities also have rewritten their rules.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">County leaders said <!-- -->they needed to<!-- --> provide more housing and a greater diversity of housing. Nationally, the <!-- -->share<!-- --> of households consisting of only one person has climbed to more than 25 percent in 2010, from less than 10 percent in 1950. In Montgomery County, the share is 24.9 percent; the county’s endless subdivisions of single-family homes were built for a bygone era. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some political leaders also emphasized the role of single-family zoning in creating and perpetuating racial and economic segregation. They said it was time to chip away at that legacy. And while opponents warned about flooding and erasing green space, there is a strong environmental case for increased density, too: Adding homes in developed areas limits driving, and the development of outlying areas.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in Montgomery County, as in most areas slowly moving to allow more development, political <!-- -->leaders<!-- --> sold the changes by emphasizing they were taking a small step that was unlikely to disrupt the status quo. “This is not going to be a humongous proliferation,” said the Council president, Nancy Navarro. Opponents concerned about more density were told that it would remain about the same. Those worried about living near poor people can find comfort in the fact that there won’t be enough new units to cut housing prices.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The problem is that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/opinion/california-housing.html?module=inline" title="">places like Montgomery County need big, disruptive changes</a> to provide affordable housing for a growing population, to address economic and racial inequality and to limit climate change. The county, which has<!-- --> more than one million residents<!-- -->, a larger population than all but a handful of American cities, is increasingly unaffordable, with average housing prices <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://gcaar.com/docs/default-source/montgomery-county-market-reports/gcaar-mc-housing-market-update---january-2019.pdf?sfvrsn=7735fe93_2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">soaring above $400,000</a>. The county’s employees are among those looking in from the outside. A county survey last year found that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/HR/Resources/Files/Classification/Compensation%20Documents/Personnel%20Management%20Review%20-%20April%202019.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">45 percent of Montgomery County’s 9,243 employees</a> lived elsewhere. Richard Hoye, 63, a retired firefighter and county resident, said that included most of his former colleagues, and was more common among younger firefighters. “Why should <!-- -->somebody risk their lives<!-- --> in a county where they can’t afford to live?” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">(Mr. Hoye bought a house with help from his parents in the early 1990s. He supported the new law because he said it would let him continue living in the county, by converting his basement into an apartment where he can live in retirement.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Navarro pointed to a recent regional study estimating that Washington, D.C., and its suburbs need <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.mwcog.org/newsroom/2018/09/12/new-cog-analysis-recommends-increase-in-area-housing-production/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">nearly 26,000</a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.mwcog.org/newsroom/2018/09/12/new-cog-analysis-recommends-increase-in-area-housing-production/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> new housing units each year</a> to keep pace with job growth — a goal that the region has not come close to achieving at any point in the last 10 years. The anger stoked by a minor leniency makes clear how hard that goal will be.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One county resident, Katherine C. Gugulis, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-turn-montgomery-county-into-a-slum/2019/06/16/48357ae2-8ec4-11e9-b6f4-033356502dce_story.html?utm_term=.b9669f603256" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">wrote a protest letter in The Washington Post</a> that concluded, “Just because others flee crime-ridden and poverty-stricken areas doesn’t mean Montgomery County has to be turned into a slum to accommodate them.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Aleksandra Rohde, a retired Army lawyer, described living in the county as a privilege that people need to earn. “You work hard, and you get to go live in Montgomery County,” she said. “Does that mean it has to be the first place you live? No. You can drive a little further and work your way up to it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is a fairly common view among county residents, and among residents of other wealthy suburbs across the country, but it misapprehends why it is so expensive to live in Montgomery County. It ignores the role of legal restrictions on the supply of housing. By reserving large parts of the county for single-family homes, the county government is subsidizing the lifestyles of existing homeowners, like Ms. Rohde, and excluding those with less money. It is a massive welfare program for the benefit of property owners.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are heartening signs that a new generation of politicians, with backing from a new generation of voters, are ready to change this. Hans Riemer, the Council member who introduced the changes, applauded his colleagues for resisting “the voices of exclusion.” He noted that the county had a history of using zoning to preserve its economic exclusivity, which contributed to racial segregation. The county, he continued, also has a history of embracing progressive policies. The challenge in Montgomery County, and other liberal, rich areas, is to apply those progressive values to housing, too.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
