<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Good morning.</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">(</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Here’s the sign-up</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">, if you don’t already get California Today delivered to your inbox.)</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When you think of Los Angeles’s biggest tourist attractions, or even its architectural landmarks, you might not think of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://barnsdall.org/hollyhock-house" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Hollyhock House</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Commissioned by the oil heiress Aline Barnsdall and completed in 1921, the house was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. But historically, it hasn’t drawn the huge flow of design-loving pilgrims that many of the architect’s most famous buildings do.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On sunny days, locals sprawl on the lawn surrounding Hollyhock House at what is now known as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://barnsdall.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Barnsdall Art Park</a>, picnicking or taking selfies with panoramic views. Getting inside the home for a self-guided tour, however, has typically required less planning than brunch.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That’s probably set to change, though: Last week, Hollyhock House <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/arts/design/frank-lloyd-wright-unesco.html?module=inline" title="">became a Unesco World Heritage Site</a> — part of an inscription that recognized eight of Wright’s major works.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He’s the first modern American architect to earn the honor, and, taken together, the group of works, which includes the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.guggenheim.org/the-frank-lloyd-wright-building" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</a> in New York and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://fallingwater.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Fallingwater</a> in Pennsylvania, is one of just 24 Unesco World Heritage sites in the U.S. (You can explore the whole <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">World Heritage List here</a>.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All of which means that Hollyhock House is likely to get a lot more visitors.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials who manage the property for the city of L.A., which owns the park and the house, told me they’re excited for the challenge.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think we’re definitely going to have to change our pitch from being a hidden gem to celebrating the fact that we’re a Los Angeles icon,” said Abbey Brach, the house’s associate curator.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She said she and her team had long drawn on the network of people who manage Frank Lloyd Wright houses around the country.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dealing with larger crowds is old hat for, say, the staff at Fallingwater, which draws about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/travel/frank-lloyd-wright-laurel-highlands-pennsylvania.html?module=inline" title="">160,000 visitors per year.</a> That’s compared with the roughly 30,000 visitors Hollyhock House hosts each year, according to Ms. Brach.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She said the Unesco recognition did not come with money, but it was a great boost for fund-raising to begin new digital initiatives and pay for restoration projects.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Christopher Hawthorne — a longtime architecture critic for The Los Angeles Times <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-hawthorne-notebook-20180312-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">who recently became the city’s chief design officer </a>— told me that as a part of Wright’s oeuvre, Hollyhock House is more than deserving of any new attention.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s really a pivotal moment in his career — a final break from the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://flwright.org/researchexplore/prairiestyle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Prairie Style</a> houses he had become known for,” Mr. Hawthorne said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The house’s design incorporates a range of architectural traditions, including Japanese and Mayan, in what Mr. Hawthorne described as a “radical hybrid” that influenced architecture in L.A. throughout the 1920s. He said the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.lapl.org/branches/central-library" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">central Los Angeles public library</a> is a great example.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, he said, it’ll be crucial to balance protecting the house, which is more fragile than a civic building, with accommodating more visitors.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And if you can’t get to Hollyhock House — or you’re hungry to see more of Wright’s California work — Mr. Hawthorne recommended <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.marincounty.org/depts/cu/tours" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the Marin Civic Center</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/arts/design/frank-lloyd-wright-unesco.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Read more about the Unesco announcement here.</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.
