<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The last time people saw Naomi Osaka at a tennis tournament, she cut off her news conference after a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/sports/wimbledon-naomi-osaka.html?module=inline" title="">first-round loss at Wimbledon</a> last month, saying, “I feel like I’m about to cry” and leaving the podium.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before she returns to competition next week in Toronto in the lead-up to her United States Open title defense, she said she “wanted to get some things off my chest.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Osaka, 21, did it in the ever-modern format of a screenshot of the Notes app posted on her social media channels, acknowledging on Wednesday that these have been the “worst months of my life.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The last few months have been really rough for me tennis wise, but thankfully I’m surrounded by people I love and who love me back (hopefully hahaha),” she wrote. “In that regard I’m very thankful for them because whenever things go wrong I blame myself 100%, I have a tendency to shut down because I don’t want to burden anyone with my thoughts or problems but they taught me to trust them and not take everything on by myself.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Osaka said recent months have also included “some of the best moments” in which she has “been able to do things that I’ve never even considered doing before.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those joys, though, have come off the court.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Osaka, 21, appeared to be on the cusp of dominance after winning consecutive Grand Slam singles titles — breaking through with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/sports/serena-williams-vs-naomi-osaka-us-open.html?module=inline" title="">last year’s U.S. Open</a> championship in September and following it with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/26/sports/tennis/naomi-osaka-australian-open.html?module=inline" title="">the Australian Open title</a> in January. The pair of major titles helped vault her to the top spot in the WTA rankings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I can honestly reflect and say I probably haven’t had fun playing tennis since Australia and I’m finally coming to terms with that while relearning that fun feeling,” Osaka said in her post. “I’ve put so much weight on the results of my matches instead of learning from them which is what I ‘normally’ do.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After reaching the peak of the sport in Melbourne, Osaka <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/sports/naomi-osaka-sascha-bajin.html?module=inline" title="">split with her coach, Sascha Bajin</a>. Around the same time, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/fl-sp-hyde-naomi-osaka-20190316-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">she and her family were sued</a> by a former childhood coach, who is seeking a percentage of her earnings. Her results have plateaued. She has a middling 13-7 record since becoming No. 1 and dropped to No. 2 in late June. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though her record on clay and grass has never been as strong as it is on hardcourts, she was still deeply disappointed with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/sports/french-open-naomi-osaka-serena-williams.html?module=inline" title="">a third-round exit </a>at the French Open and the early loss at Wimbledon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Osaka’s social media post on Wednesday was her first significant public statement since Wimbledon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Having this time to reflect and think (from losing in the 1st round lololol), I’ve learned a lot about myself and I feel like I grew so much as a person in this past year(s),” she wrote. “So I’m really excited what the future looks like on and off the court.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Osaka wrote <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/Naomi_Osaka_/status/1030201441309343749" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a similar post</a> last year after a loss in Cincinnati. She said at the time, “I haven’t been feeling the ball right and it’s thrown me off a lot to the point where I started getting really frustrated and depressed during my practices.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She had won the biggest title of her young career on the hardcourts of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/sports/tennis/naomi-osaka-indian-wells-finals.html?module=inline" title="">Indian Wells, Calif.</a>, in March 2018, and said she “had a lot of pressure entering the hardcourt swing because I felt a lot of expectation on me from Indian Wells and I didn’t feel like the underdog anymore, (which is a totally new feeling for me).” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She finished last year’s message on an optimistic note, heralding future successes: “I finally felt that fun feeling playing tennis” and signed off, “Update finished, see you in NY.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There in New York, she was seen winning the U.S. Open.</p>
