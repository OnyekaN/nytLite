<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SAN FRANCISCO — Facebook has built an extensive network of tracking technology outside of its core social network to bolster its targeted advertising business. That has allowed the company to collect information about its users’ browsing habits, even when they were not using the social network.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, Facebook said it was changing its practices related to that data — kind of.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company introduced a new tool that lets people better see and control the information that Facebook has gathered about their browsing habits outside the social network.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The tool, Off-Facebook Activity, allows users to view the hundreds of sites and apps that share data and customer information with Facebook. They can then erase the data it they want.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is another way to give people more transparency and control on Facebook,” the company said in a blog post. It added that people generally had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/apps-used-2017/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">more than 80 apps</a> on their phones and used about half of them every month, making it difficult to know which ones had collected personal information and how the data was being used.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The introduction of the new tool is Facebook’s latest response to criticism over how it safeguards users’ privacy. The issue exploded last year after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?module=inline" title=""> The New York Times</a> and other outlets reported on how a British consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, had harvested the personal information of more than 50 million Facebook users without their permission.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facebook has been trying since then to contain the fallout, attracting scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world. Last month, the company <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/technology/ftc-facebook-privacy-data.html?module=inline" title="">reached a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission</a> over privacy violations, agreeing to pay a $5 billion fine and to change how it handled users’ data.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Amid the backlash over Facebook’s approach to privacy issues, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, has said the company would develop a technological solution that would give people the ability to clear their browsing histories.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facebook said it initially hoped to provide an option that would let users delete the entire repository of data that the company collected from other sites to improve its targeting of ads. But Facebook said its research showed that people did not want such an all-or-nothing option. Instead, Facebook said, users frequently asked for better visibility into which sites were providing browsing-habit data to the company, and for more control over how the information was shared.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new tool will not be a cure-all for those concerned about privacy on Facebook. The company will continue to retain all browsing data of users on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet by giving people the option of wiping clean their browsing history outside Facebook and its apps, the company is taking a risk because of its partial dependence on such information for targeting ads at users. The company said it was prepared for the consequences of users’ deciding to exercise greater control over their privacy by using the tool.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If this were widely adopted, it would mean less overall revenue for Facebook,” David Baser, a director of product management at the company, said in an interview. “And that’s O.K.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new tool can be found in the settings menu of the Facebook app. Once people click on it, they can look into an itemized history of the outside apps and websites they have visited that have shared data with the social network. They can also see the types of data the apps and sites have shared.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A user might see that a site for a clothing retailer had one of Facebook’s tracking cookies installed on its web page. If a customer browsed a pair of pants on the site and then returned to Facebook, the social network’s tracking technology may have shown that user an ad for the same pair of pants inside the Facebook app.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beyond having access to the itemized browsing history, people can also use the tool to delete the historical browsing data entirely, or to erase data from individual sites and apps. The tool also lets people turn off data-sharing from all sites and apps off Facebook in the future.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facebook said that the new tool would be rolled out gradually in the coming months, beginning on Tuesday in Ireland, South Korea and Spain.</p>
