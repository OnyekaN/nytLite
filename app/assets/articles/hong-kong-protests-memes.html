<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HONG KONG — A Broadway anthem. A Bruce Lee quote. Nods to John Lennon and Quentin Tarantino.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Legions of anti-government protesters have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/world/asia/protests-in-hong-kong-arrests.html?module=inline" title="">filled Hong Kong’s streets this summer</a>, in the territory’s worst political crisis since Britain returned it to China in 1997. But even as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/world/asia/china-military-hong-kong-taiwan-protests.html?module=inline" title="">tensions rise</a>, protesters are being motivated in the streets (and on social media) by exuberant memes, slogans, songs and artwork.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like Hong Kong itself, the movement’s aural and visual iconography channels a wide range of Asian and Western influences. Here’s a look at some of the creative expressions and pop-culture inspirations that are propelling demonstrators through a hot, contentious summer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Protesters have released slick videos that promote their cause while paying homage to the Japanese anime film tradition, which often features surreal imagery and biting social commentary.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In one popular video, young demonstrators march in their signature uniform — yellow helmets and face masks — as one carries a yellow umbrella, a symbol of the protest movement since 2014, when demonstrators blocked major streets in Hong Kong to demand more democratic elections.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“No matter how difficult the road ahead is, we will keep walking forward together,” a solemn narrator says.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In another video, a narrator reads out the protesters’ five main demands — including Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s resignation and full withdrawal of a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China — over a furious drumbeat, against a backdrop of street clashes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The clip’s cinematography evokes the aesthetic of popular anime, including “Cowboy Bebop,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/asteroid-blues-the-lasting-legacy-of-cowboy-bebop/383817/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a series by the director Shinichiro Watanabe</a> in which characters fight for justice in a lawless universe.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hollywood references infuse many of the slogans and memes coursing through the protests.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One popular slogan — “If we burn, you burn with us” — is a defiant line delivered by Jennifer Lawrence’s character in the “Hunger Games” movies, based on the dystopian young-adult novels by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/books/suzanne-collins-talks-about-the-hunger-games-the-books-and-the-movies.html?module=inline" title="">Suzanne Collins</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another, “Ideas don’t die,” appeared on a poster commemorating a demonstrator who died this summer, alongside an image of the rain jacket the man was wearing when he fell from a building.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That phrase seems to refer to a line in the 2005 film “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/movies/who-is-this-masked-avenger-guy-fawkes-count-of-monte-cristo-or-a.html?module=inline" title="">V for Vendetta</a>,” in which a masked avenger battling a totalitarian regime utters the line, “Ideas are bulletproof.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another protest poster that has circulated online shows Mrs. Lam’s head superimposed over the body of the actress Uma Thurman, star of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/10/movies/film-review-blood-bath-beyond.html?module=inline" title="">Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” martial-arts films</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In this case, the “bill” in question is not a person, but Mrs. Lam’s extradition legislation, which was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-bill.html?module=inline" title="">the initial trigger for the protests</a>. Mrs. Lam has suspended the bill and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/world/asia/carrie-lam-hong-kong.html?module=inline" title="">said it was “dead</a>,“ but she has stopped short of formally withdrawing it, as protesters have demanded.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A recurring visual feature of the protests has been the so-called Lennon Walls, where people have posted hundreds or even thousands of slogans — mostly on Post-it notes — in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/lennonwallhk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">public spaces<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>across the city</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their name comes from a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/09/world/upheaval-in-the-east-prague-s-velvet-revolutionaries-recall-john-lennon.html?module=inline" title="">wall in Prague</a> where tributes to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/john-lennon?module=inline" title="">John Lennon</a> appeared after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1980/12/09/issue.html" title="">the former Beatle’s murder in 1980</a>. It evolved into a place where young Czechs expressed support for democracy and aired grievances against the Communist regime ruling Czechoslovakia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the 2014 protests in Hong Kong, demonstrators created their own Lennon Wall, papering a wall near the legislative building with slogans. And this summer, the walls seem to have sprouted everywhere, galaxies of Post-its denouncing the police, calling for more democracy and expressing <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/world/asia/carrie-lam-hong-kong.html?module=inline" title="">frustration with Mrs. Lam</a>. Some of the displays have been torn down by people who oppose the protests, but they keep springing back up.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Come together, leave together,” read one Post-it note in Chinese — evoking a Beatles song, though perhaps not deliberately. “No retraction, no retreat.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During street clashes with riot police this summer, some protesters have encouraged each other by shouting the phrase “Be water” (or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BeWater?src=hashtag_click" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">spreading it on Twitter</a>).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That’s a reference to a famous line uttered by Bruce Lee, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/obituaries/archives/bruce-lee?module=inline" title="">the late actor and martial-arts icon from Hong Kong</a>, in a 1971 episode of the American television series “Longstreet.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Chinese Taoism, water represents power and flexibility in the face of obstacles. “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsavc5l9QR4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Water can flow, or creep, or drip, or crash</a>,” Mr. Lee said. “Be water, my friend.” Many protesters see the line as a symbol of their civil disobedience, permeating Hong Kong society as water flows over a stone.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of the demonstrators who swarmed the Hong Kong legislative building earlier this summer sang renditions of “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://time.com/5608882/sing-hallelujah-to-the-lord-protestors-hong-kong-extradition-anthem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Sing Hallelujah to the Lord</a>,” a 1974 hymn by the American composer Linda Stassen.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The choice partly reflects how Hong Kong’s Christians, about one in nine of the city’s 7.5 million people, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-protests-christians.html?module=inline" title="">tend to be active in its pro-democracy movement</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s also a canny strategic choice: Since mass demonstrations in Hong Kong require pre-emptive police approval, some protesters sing hymns because religious assemblies — which are not subject to the same rules — are harder for the police to justify breaking up.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another popular refrain this summer has been the chorus of “Do You Hear the People Sing?” from the Broadway musical “Les Misérables” (which was adapted from the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/books/review/novel-of-the-century-les-miserables-david-bellos.html?module=inline" title="">1862 novel by Victor Hugo</a>).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the play, and a 2012 film <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/movies/les-miserables-stars-anne-hathaway-and-hugh-jackman.html?module=inline" title="">starring Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman</a>, “Do you hear the people sing?” is an anti-establishment rallying cry for demonstrators in 19th-century France.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But on a recent evening in Hong Kong, Harold Tsai, a protester who was playing the song from a speaker toward a nearby police barricade, said that not all officers seemed to view the song as an antagonistic gesture.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Some of them sing it,” Mr. Tsai, 28, added. “I see their mouths moving.”</p>
