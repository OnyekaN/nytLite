This is research, several years of it, and all that attention couldn’t come to a nicer larva. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This lively leaper is the young, wriggly form of an insect called the gall midge. It is found in galls, or bumps on plants, not in rotting meat — so that’s a plus. And it’s so tiny, only a tenth of an inch long. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We knew the little fellows could jump, we being the scientific community that studies the quick and surprising movements of soft-bodied cylindrical insect larvae. But only with a video camera recording at 20,000 frames per second, and the use of scanning electron microscopes, did researchers come up with a detailed analysis of just how the marvelous maggots move. Earlier recordings were no faster than 54 frames per second.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fairly obvious part, which had been figured out, more or less, is that the larva bends its soft body into a springy loop and launches itself across distances up to 30 times its body length. But there are some surprises, a research team <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://jeb.biologists.org/content/222/15/jeb201129" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reported Thursday in the Journal of Experimental Biology</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The larva uses two patches of microscopic hairs that bond to each other <!-- -->to <!-- -->form a latch that links its front and rear end together.

The larvae did not use an anatomical feature called a spatula, which they use to burrow, in order to link front and back. Instead, those patches of microscopic hairs adhered to each other because of so called van der Waals forces, which involve electric attraction and repulsion.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And to help with the launch, the maggots formed a temporary leg of sorts by making a portion of their bodies particularly rigid. The researchers also found that for the larvae, jumping was much more efficient than crawling. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That may be why the larvae leap — to explore spots to burrow. Or it could be to escape predators. Until scientists come up with an answer, we are free to imagine that they jump for joy. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/science/hu-robotics.html?module=inline" title="">David Hu, </a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/science/hu-robotics.html?module=inline" title="">a mechanical engineer at Georgia Tech who often studies animal movements</a> but was not involved in this research, said the paper was “full of surprises,” such as the latch: <!-- -->“It’s a soft latch, composed of thousands of microscopic parts, that can shoot a soft larva like its being shot out of a cannon.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Patek said the research shows “what you can do with a tiny, worm-shaped body,” and noted that “engineers are extremely interested in soft robotics.”</p>
