<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">CALGARY, Alberta — This should not have been a competitive election.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Justin Trudeau won a healthy majority government in 2015, it seemed as if destiny itself had cleared the way for the scrappy scion of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to dominate Canadian politics for years to come. Neither the Conservative Party nor the New Democratic Party nor the Green Party had any leader in the hopper who seemed able to compete with the Kennedy-esque Mr. Trudeau, who scored <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vogue.com/article/justin-trudeau-prime-minister-canada" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">photo shoots in Vogue </a>and his <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/justin-trudeau-joins-canadian-superheroes-for-marvel-comics-cover-1.3655625" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">own comic book cover</a>. He should have been untouchable for an election or two, at least.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And yet on Monday, Mr. Trudeau’s government was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/world/canada/elections-canada-results.html?module=inline" title="">reduced to a minority</a>. His party lost the popular vote to the Conservatives. Canada’s electoral map is now disturbingly divided between the Liberal-dominated east of the country, and the Conservative-dominated west. Mr. Trudeau will likely depend on the support of the other parties to keep his hold on power.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What happened to Canada’s progressive idol? The short answer is that Mr. Trudeau came to power when Canadian politics was dominated by issues like deficit spending, electoral reform and whether a local Conservative candidate <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=057VKyU35jA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">peed in a cup</a> on television. At the time, he presented a happy contrast to incumbent Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who seemed stodgy, cynical and petty by comparison. Mr. Trudeau’s campaign promised “sunny ways” and at a time when the future looked rosy for Canada, voters responded warmly to the change of tone.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the world has grown much scarier and more uncertain since the 2015 election. And Mr. Trudeau has done little to convince voters that he is the right man to manage it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Take, for example, the refugee crisis. Mr. Trudeau won in part in 2015 after striking a compassionate stance on the global crisis in the wake of the death of Alan Kurdi, the little refugee boy whose body washed up on a beach in Turkey, inspiring horror and outrage around the world.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a moment for Mr. Trudeau to distinguish himself. Canada has always seen itself as welcoming toward refugees, and the Liberal Party responded by promising Canada would take in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-syria-refugees-settlement-groups-1.3291959" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">25,000 Syrian refugees</a> by the end of the year. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>But Canada’s once-easy consensus on matters of asylum and immigration has been shaken over the past four years. Canadian openness was sorely tested shortly after Mr. Trudeau’s election by an influx of asylum seekers using loopholes to enter the country <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/the-national-roxham-road-immigration-border-1.5169249" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">at unofficial border crossings</a>. Perhaps as a result, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/05/theres-a-perception-that-canada-is-being-invaded/561032/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reporting</a> has shown a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/the-rise-of-an-uncaring-canada/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">growing unease</a> about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/canadians-believe-in-immigration-but-concerned-about-asylum-seekers-study-1.4057446" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">asylum seekers</a>; far-right groups have even taken to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/far-right-groups-counter-protesters-descend-on-lacolle-border-crossing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">protesting near the border.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trudeau was also elected in 2015, just as President Barack Obama was in the twilight of his term. Relations between Canada and the United States seemed warm. The relationship between the two leaders was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpNknqySZl8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">even described as a “bromance</a>.” (<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/17/obamas-strange-irresponsible-endorsement-justin-trudeau/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Mr. Obama endorsed Mr. Trudeau</a> via Twitter in the closing days of this campaign.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The warm feelings did not last long. In 2016 came the election of Donald Trump. Whatever Mr. Trump’s election says about the state of the liberal world order, or of America’s political and economic insecurities, none of it has been particularly comforting for your friendly neighbors to the north.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump broke with recent tradition by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-presidential-visits-to-canada-1.5113449" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">visiting other countries ahead of Canada</a> early in his term. Mr. Trudeau went from being one-half of a bromance to the guy whose firm handshake became a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/the-handshake-trudeau-resists-trump-jerk-and-pull-1.3284460" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">matter of international scrutiny</a>. A relationship that once seemed unshakable now seems vulnerable to partisan whim.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump and Mr. Trudeau might be considered political foils — except one man represents a global superpower and a country ten times Canada’s size. Down south, the revised <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/world/europe/usmca-trump-justin-trudeau.html?module=inline" title="">North American trade agreement</a> may be a petty partisan affair that scores a few laugh lines on the stump; up here, that trade deal was a matter of obsession on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/180606/t001a-eng.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">national political talk shows</a> for months.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Canadian domestic politics have also taken an ugly turn. The drop in oil and gas prices, amid difficulty building pipelines, has resulted in depressed economies in the western provinces, raising the specter of an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/jason-kenney-federalism-separation-1.5316082" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">angry new separatist movement</a> in Alberta. Paradoxically, Mr. Trudeau’s attempt to head off that movement by purchasing the Trans Mountain pipeline was seen as a betrayal by progressive and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-csis-says-ottawas-trans-mountain-pipeline-purchase-seen-as-betrayal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Indigenous communities</a> who believed Mr. Trudeau would be a champion of climate change.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All of these incidents have shaken Canadian’s faith in our alliances, our economy and ourselves.<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>Though Canada’s economy is strong, according to monthly polls conducted by the polling firm Ipsos Public Affairs, more than half the country believes a recession is imminent. The firm’s barometer of consumer sentiment and sociopolitical stability has registered a steady decline since the end of <!-- -->2016<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Just a few years ago, Mr. Trudeau’s charisma and progressive bona fides were everything Canada wanted to say about itself to the world. But symbolism and optimism alone feel thin when the risks to your institutions and economies grow material.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Mr. Trudeau, we have a leader whose major legislative achievements include legalizing marijuana and putting in place a carbon tax. His greatest hits in power include gallivanting across India in an outfit so outlandish he could have served as a cast member in a Disney remake.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He demonstrated the hollowness of his progressive virtues during what became known as the SNC-Lavalin scandal, in which he allegedly <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://nationalpost.com/opinion/andrew-coyne-the-real-scandal-in-the-lavalin-affair-is-trudeaus-attempts-to-pretend-its-not-a-scandal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">sidelined Canada’s first Indigenous attorney general</a> because she refused to subvert the independence of her office by granting a politically well-connected engineering firm a pass on corruption charges. The episode betrayed a government that is just as centralized, controlling and cynical as the one it replaced.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Time magazine’s discovery and publication of photographs depicting Mr. Trudeau <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://time.com/5680759/justin-trudeau-brownface-photo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in painted brownface</a> and wearing a garish Aladdin costume was the perfect encapsulation of the man’s faults.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">No one seriously believes that Mr. Trudeau is or was a racist — at least not in a way that intends active malice. Rather, this prime minister, who has apparently lost track of how many times he darkened his skin for fun, is a blinkered frat boy. A child prince who, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.newsweek.com/justin-trudeau-enthusiastic-costumes-brownface-1460206" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in the past</a>, has sometimes “been more enthusiastic about costumes than is sometimes appropriate.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Liberals themselves tried to capitalize on a growing sense of insecurity among Canadians during the election by portraying the Conservatives as racist Trump-lite populists. However bad this tactic made the Conservatives look, it did as much to highlight the Liberals’ key weakness — that if Canada is facing some kind of ascendant far-right threat, this lightweight who wore blackface may not be the one best equipped to meet it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Given the domestic and global factors that influenced this election, no doubt many Liberals will see securing a minority government as a success. This is the victory of low expectations. Mr. Trudeau will now struggle pass budgets and maintain confidence in the House of Commons in a divided country.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The only factor saving Mr. Trudeau from a disastrous outcome on Monday was that none of the other parties convinced the electorate that they were better equipped to deal with the future that lies ahead. That was their failure. But Canadians should expect to be back at the ballot box before too long. And if you were a Canadian voter suddenly troubled by such uncertainty, honestly, is this the guy you would pick again?</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Jen Gerson (<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/jengerson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">@JenGerson</a>), a contributing editor to Maclean’s magazine who writes regularly for the CBC and The Walrus, is a co-host of the Canadian politics podcast “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.canadalandshow.com/shows/oppo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Oppo</a>.”</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
