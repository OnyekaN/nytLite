<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Across their kayaks, the three men passed the green shoot back and forth. Occasionally, one of them would cradle it in one palm and bring a hand lens to it with the other, inspecting the carnivorous plant that was their bounty.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By day’s end, the group — Seth Cunningham and Michael Tessler, biologists at the American Museum of Natural History, and John Thompson, coordinator of the Catskill Regional Invasive Species Partnership — filled eight vials with the plant, Aldrovanda vesiculosa, also known as the waterwheel. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The plant shouldn’t be in this small, privately owned pond in Orange County, N.Y., and it presents an ecological conundrum. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Around the world, the waterwheel is going extinct. But from summer through late fall, the carnivorous, rootless, wetland-loving plant is plentiful in this swampy body of water near the Catskill Mountains.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s either site zero for saving a species,” Dr. Tessler said, “or site zero for a really big problem.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Think of the waterwheel as an underwater Venus flytrap. Its whorled shoots are tiny, typically shorter than eight inches and less than an inch thick. But for a plant, its diet is impressive: seed shrimp, shell-less crustaceans, insect larvae, and occasionally even tadpoles and small fish. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When prey tickles one of the waterwheel’s traps, it snaps shut in less than <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0012" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">10 milliseconds</a>, one-tenth the time it takes for your eyes to blink.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Until recently, the plant floated across fens, ponds and reservoirs in Australia, Asia, Africa and Europe. But today, human-driven habitat destruction has pushed the waterwheel into free fall.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the last 150 years, nearly <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.butbn.cas.cz/adamec/PPEES2018.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">90 percent</a> of its habitat has vanished worldwide, and the waterwheel’s survival status is extinct or unverified in at least 32 of the 43 countries where it naturally occurs. In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature added Aldrovanda vesiculosa to its “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/162346/901031" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">red list</a>” of globally threatened species.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The species is completely imperiled,” said Adam Cross, an ecologist at Curtin University in Australia who studies the plant.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2013, Dr. Cross traveled to the Fort A.P.

When growers in Virginia struggled to cultivate the Japanese plants in plastic containers, they <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://bioone.org/journals/the-journal-of-the-torrey-botanical-society/volume-140/issue-4/1095-5674-140.4.517/Extant-populations-of-iAldrovanda-vesiculosa-i-Droseraceae-in-the-New/10.3159/1095-5674-140.4.517.short" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">introduced them to shallow backyard ponds</a>, according to a 2013 account published in the Journal of the Torrey Botanical Society.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By the late 1990s, waterwheel transplants in five counties in Virginia had flourished into established populations. Around that time, Richard Sivertsen, a well known grower of carnivorous plants, decided to bring it to New Jersey and New York.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 1999, Mr. Sivertsen (who died in 2017) picked a dozen sites, such as abandoned sand and gravel pits, small ditches and artificial koi ponds, which he deemed sufficiently isolated from pristine wetlands and larger water bodies. Then, having harvested some of the Virginia transplants, he drove around for two days, scattering Aldrovanda like a Tristate Johnny Appleseed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Sivertsen found no trace of the plant when he returned to the spots — save one. In 2002, in a stinky discharge basin behind a shopping mall prone to green algal blooms and crawling with brown rats and tubifex worms, he spotted a familiar green shoot.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“A visit to the site one week later revealed that the shoots had made a quantum leap in growth,” he wrote in his 2013 account. Over the next decade, botanists documented similar spurts in the Northeast.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In October 2012, Chris Doyle, now director of biology at Solitude Lake Management, an aquatic consulting company, and his colleagues found thousands of waterwheels in Bear Swamp, near Lake Owassa in New Jersey.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We had no idea what it was,” Mr. Doyle said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By that year, waterwheels had colonized the edges of the privately owned pond in New York. Mr. Sivertsen’s son, Kevin, who was a child at the time, recalled his father’s surprise that a finicky species vulnerable to slight environmental changes had taken hold — let alone taken off.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He was very concerned that the plant would go extinct and be wiped from the face of the earth,” said Kevin Sivertsen. “That was a big part of it for him. He was happy to take the risk of it intruding in a new ecosystem, rather than having it go extinct.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2009, in an online <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cpukforum.com/forum/index.php?/topic/26301-my-aldrovanda-pond/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">plant forum</a>, Mr. Sivertsen responded to a comment calling his introductions irresponsible: “I consider it as ‘farming.’” He added, “Let’s hope that some of us can find a way to keep it alive.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He didn’t realize what he was doing at the time,” Mr. Doyle said. “I think Richard understood later on that people don’t take kindly to inviting invasive species to undocumented habitats.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because its arrival is so recent and research so scarce, biologists don’t know how, or how quickly, the waterwheel may spread. They also don’t know what exactly it’s eating in local waters, which could help quantify the threat it poses, if any.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“‘Invasive’ implies that a species is detrimental,” Dr. Cross said. “There hasn’t been a sufficient level of study to say either way.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In its native range, biologists have extensively studied the waterwheel’s ecological niche. It is highly specific to wetlands, where it is a predator of small invertebrates. Studies have suggested that it can coexist peacefully with other carnivorous plants, Dr. Cross said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, little research has been conducted on the species to see if these findings hold true in North American ecosystems.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a 2013 study to assess the species’ potential invasiveness, Dr. Cross and other researchers surveyed nine locations at Virginia’s Fort A.P. Hill. They found that, at its most abundant, waterwheels could pack <!-- -->1,260 strands into each square meter<!-- -->. But the team concluded in a 2015 paper that it <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.pitcherplant.org/Papers/Population%20ecology%20of%20the%20endangered%20aquatic%20macrophyte%20Aldrovanda%20vesiculosa.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">was not competing with native aquatic plants</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">However, Dr. Cross pointed out, a robust waterwheel population of millions of strands, each studded with dozens of hungry traps, could threaten local invertebrates and other fauna.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another 2015 study at the Virginia fort cautioned that in a single year, the species <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://bioone.org/journals/castanea/volume-80/issue-3/15-056/iAldrovanda-vesiculosai-at-Fort-AP-Hill-Virginia/10.2179/15-056.short" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">had spread from one 27-acre site to 156 acres of wetlands</a> in at least five ponds open to recreational boating and angling — activities which could spread the species further.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Conservation officials are monitoring the plant to see if it’s spreading in New Jersey and Virginia, a task sometimes made difficult because they don’t have access to waters on private lands.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, New York’s sole documented site is the small body of water upstate, and environmental DNA sequencing by Dr. Tessler has not turned up the plant’s genetic fingerprint in other Catskills ponds.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, officials worry it could spread to nearby waterways and outcompete native carnivorous plant species, Mr. Young said, such as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/science/humped-bladderwort-carnivorous-plant-genome.html?module=inline" title="">bladderworts</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s something we really need to watch,” said Mr. Thompson.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Carnivorous plants thrive in bogs and other marginal habitats with limited nutrients by surviving on the bodies of small animals. That’s how the waterwheel has survived for about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318080882_Systematics_and_evolution_of_Droseraceae" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">50 million years</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as humans have decimated or degraded wetlands for development and agriculture, Aldrovanda, too, has suffered. Warming climates, increasing drought and eutrophication — overly nutrient waters — have only exacerbated unfavorable conditions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s pretty clear why this species is going extinct,” Dr. Cross said. “It’s experienced an almost perfect storm of what humans can do.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, it’s up to humans to decide what to do with the new, thriving populations in the United States.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s not the first time relocated waterwheel has stirred controversy. In 10 European countries, scientists have successfully reintroduced Aldrovanda to locales in which the plant had disappeared, said Lubomír Adamec, a plant ecologist at the Institute of Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists also transplanted waterwheel to four countries where it never naturally occurred: Switzerland, Germany, Czech Republic and, around 2006, the Netherlands.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are now tens of thousands of waterwheel strands in a nature reserve near Amsterdam. At first, Dutch authorities attempted to eradicate the plants, but now they have decided to let it be.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Adamec said he and other European researchers believe rescuing endangered species will increasingly depend on such transplants, “so that the case of Aldrovanda shall not be exceptional, but normal and ordinary in a near future.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That can still feel like a gamble to wildlife officials in the Northeast, who are already scarred from battles with other invasive aquatic species, such as Eurasian watermilfoil and hydrilla, Mr. Doyle said. From their perspective, early prevention is cheaper than managing an explosion.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Once it gets out of the barn, you might not be able to do much about it,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once waterwheel is entrenched, management options are limited. While it can be hand-collected, just one or two individuals can seed an entire population. The alternative is an herbicide that kills every plant in the area. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With few practical options, Dr. Cross, Mr. Doyle and other experts have suggested the plant should remain monitored, but mostly left alone.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What should not happen again, according to Eric Lamont of the Long Island Botanical Society, are campaigns to introduce plants into environments where they did not evolve — however well intentioned.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You don’t want to just willy-nilly introduce it to areas,” he said. “This is not the way to try to save a species.”</p>
