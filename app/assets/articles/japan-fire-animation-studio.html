<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">TOKYO — For the second time in two months, Japan has been shocked by devastating apparent violence in a country that is generally considered one of the safest in the world.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Kyoto police said on Thursday that a 41-year-old man was believed to have ignited a flammable liquid around an animation studio in Kyoto. The resulting fire killed 33 people in what is believed to be country’s deadliest arson attack in three decades.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fire came just weeks after a man went on a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/world/asia/japan-stabbing-schoolchildren.html?module=inline" title="">stabbing rampage</a> in a Tokyo suburb, attacking 17 schoolgirls, killing one of them as well as an adult. That rampage, by a 51-year-old man, cast attention to the phenomenon of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/world/asia/japan-hikikomori-recluses.html?module=inline" title="">Japan’s “hikikomori”</a> — adults who are extreme recluses — and their psychological issues.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the studio of Kyoto Animation, which has produced popular shows and movies including “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328739/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Full Metal Panic</a>,” “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1410218/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">K-On</a>” and “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1118804/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Clannad</a>” and has done contract work for the world-famous anime company Studio Ghibli, three dozen people were also injured in the morning blaze.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The man believed to have set the fire, who was hospitalized with burns, was being detained. NHK, Japan’s public broadcaster, said the police planned to question him further after he told them he had splashed flammable liquid near the studio building and set it alight.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Citing the Kyoto police, the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan’s largest mainstream dailies, reported that the man had entered the building screaming “Die!” and then tried to escape, but collapsed on the street outside. He was captured by members of the studio’s staff.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thursday’s tragedy touched a nerve among the Japanese public, who poured out their grief on social media. The hashtag <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PrayForKyoani" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">#prayforKyoAni</a> had 170,000 tweets late Thursday evening.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Arson is rare in Japan, and experts quoted by NHK said it was the worst case since 1989. In 2001, 44 people died after a fire broke out at a crowded gambling club in Tokyo’s busiest entertainment district, but that was ruled accidental.</p><p class="g-pstyle0">80 miles</p><p class="g-pstyle1">JAPAN</p><p class="g-pstyle2">Area of</p><p class="g-pstyle2">detail</p><p class="g-pstyle3">Japan</p><p class="g-pstyle4">Tokyo</p><p class="g-pstyle5">Kyoto</p><p class="g-pstyle6">Pacific Ocean</p><p class="css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit" data-testid="credit" id="interactive-credit">By The New York Times</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kyoto Animation was founded by Yoko Hatta and her husband, Hideaki Hatta, in 1981, and most of the studio’s production <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-07-17/fire-breaks-out-in-kyoto-animation-1st-studio-building/.149097" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">takes place in the building</a> that was the site of Thursday’s fire.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Footage of Thursday’s fire from a local television station showed black smoke pouring out of windows of the three-story building, with one side of the building mostly charred black.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The shows and movies that Kyoto Animation produces fall into the category of Japanese cartooning known as anime — a backbone of the country’s popular culture and one of its major soft-power exports.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With roots going back to the early 20th century, anime has found an international following through artists like Hayao Miyazaki, whose feature “Spirited Away” won an Oscar in 2003, and Makoto Shinkai, whose movie “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/04/movies/the-anime-master-of-missed-connections-makes-strong-contact-in-japan.html?module=inline" title="">Your Name</a>” was a global phenomenon, particularly in China.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/shinkaimakoto/status/1151692316958052354" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Twitter</a>, Mr. Shinkai showed his support for the Kyoto Animation staff. “Everyone at Kyoto Animation, please please stay safe,” he said, in a message that was recirculated almost 19,000 times.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also expressed sympathy on Twitter for the victims of the fire.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Today, we had many casualties in a fatal arson attack that happened in Kyoto,” Mr. Abe wrote. “It is so horrifying that I am at a loss for words. I’d like to express my deepest condolences to the victims. I offer my thoughts to those who have been wounded and pray for their recovery, by even one day.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Witnesses who spoke to other Japanese news outlets described grim scenes near the studio. According to the Mainichi Shimbun, another large daily, a woman in her 60s living near the building said she had seen a young woman, her entire body burned, screaming and running into a nearby shop, begging for help.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The witness said the woman was bleeding, her clothing torn and her feet bare. “It took a long time until the ambulance arrived,” the witness told the Mainichi. “All I could do was to spray water over her under the fire department’s instruction. She was eventually transferred to an ambulance.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another witness who was working near the studio when the fire broke out told the Sankei Shimbun that he had seen flames coming from the buildings’ first and second floors and heard screaming. The witness said he had seen a man hanging onto the wall outside the building, and another trying to escape from a first-floor window after breaking it.</p>
