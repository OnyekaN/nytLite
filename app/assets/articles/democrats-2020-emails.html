<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The emails came, ostensibly, from the candidates’ personal iPhones, from their campaign managers, from their parents and spouses and children. They asked for signatures, for survey responses and, of course — incessantly and creatively — for money. They promised to “be blunt,” to “level with you,” to “be completely honest.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They were not always completely honest.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the end of April, I gave my email address to every Democratic presidential candidate except Wayne Messam, <!-- -->whose website wouldn’t let me. <!-- -->For six weeks, I read every message I received in my inbox. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I learned some fun facts — like that Bernie Sanders is into paragraph-long subject lines, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. prefers pseudo-personal ones (“hey maggie,” “sorry maggie”). But I also learned some more substantive things about the candidates’ strategies, and about how they are choosing to present themselves.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[We tracked down the 2020 Democrats and asked them the same set of 18 questions. </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-candidate-interviews.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Watch them answer.</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Week after week, Cory Booker and Michael Bennet have been pleading for “founding donors” as though wooing investors for a start-up. This campaign is about to take off, they <!-- -->say,<!-- --> and you can get in on the ground floor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Everyone who chips in before the next phase of this race, when the debates begin, will be the founders of this campaign — the people who took a risk on me and our underdog operation,” Mr. Booker wrote May 23.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In this cycle’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html?module=inline" title="">historically crowded Democratic field</a>, he and Mr. Bennet are not the only low-polling candidates who argue that the establishment is underestimating them. </p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Cory Booker</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">“I’m used to being underestimated.”</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Julián Castro</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">“I wasn’t born a front-runner.”</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">Kirsten Gillibrand</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">“I’m used to being an underdog.”</p><p class="css-1tcdk0r e6idgb70">John Hickenlooper</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">“I’ve always been a dark horse.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Every so often, candidates, especially those with levels of support bordering on invisible, send an email claiming sudden momentum. Mr. Bennet has done it; Steve Bullock has done it; John Hickenlooper, Jay Inslee, Seth Moulton and Tim Ryan have all done it. Their claims are rarely supported by data, but they do serve a purpose, because the underdog strategy has a shelf life: Sooner or later, a successful underdog has to show some potential to become the top dog. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stranger to see are the emails from front-runners trying to play down their position, lest their supporters get complacent and the money stream falter. When I opened my inbox May 29, with the polls showing Mr. Biden nearly 20 percentage points ahead of the next-closest candidate, I found him warning me, “Don’t believe the polls.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/democratic-polls.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Find the latest data and analysis</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to keep track of who’s leading the race to be the Democratic nominee.]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Look Maggie, we know what you’re thinking — we’re ahead in the polls, so these deadlines don’t matter,” the email said. “We are here to tell you that is dead wrong. Polls change every day. The only way to keep our lead is to continue to get out there, <!-- -->knock<!-- --> doors, hold events and talk to voters. And that takes money.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden added, straining credulity, that because he had entered the race later than most other candidates, he needed to “catch up to the pack.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Want to grab a beer with Mr. Hickenlooper or Elizabeth Warren? Attend the first debate with Amy Klobuchar or Mr. Ryan? You could have, if only you had donated a dollar. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the field saturated, the candidates have been falling over one another to give voters the best incentive to donate — or to get their attention at all. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In early June, Bill de Blasio tried to lure voters to his website with an important poll about President Trump. “We need to take a moment and make a very tough decision together, as a group: which of #ConDon’s egregious lies to the American people is the worst one of all time?” he wrote, using a hashtag he has tried mightily to make happen. (It hasn’t happened.) </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Bennet, meanwhile, got my attention May 24 with the subject line “can we send you a FREE sticker?” Inside, the fine print: “Can you chip in $1 right now to help us cover postage?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a clever, if transparent, gimmick from a candidate struggling to get enough donors to guarantee his spot in the first debates. If supporters bought a $1 sticker from his campaign store, it wouldn’t count as a donation for the purposes of debate qualification. But giving him $1 in exchange for a “free” sticker is a different story.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When President Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/politics/trump-kamala-harris-barr.html?module=inline" title="">said in May</a> that Kamala Harris was “probably very nasty” — echoing the “nasty woman” insult he used against Hillary Clinton — it was only a matter of time before Ms. Harris weaponized the remark. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It seems like anytime Donald Trump feels threatened by a strong woman, he lashes out with this gross, weird attack,” her communications director, Lily Adams, wrote the next day. “It’s the kind of sexism that makes me want to run my head through a wall. But instead of doing that, let’s do something productive. I know we’ve asked a lot lately — but can you step up and add a donation to Kamala’s campaign today?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A month later, Ms. Gillibrand did the same after a tense exchange <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-fox-town-hall.html?module=inline" title="">on Fox News</a>, in which she denounced Fox’s coverage of abortion and the moderator suggested she was being rude. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The suffragists sure as hell didn’t make change by worrying about being polite,” Ms. Gillibrand wrote two days later. “I promise you I’ll be this brave and this fearless from the Democratic debate stage, too — but I need your help to guarantee I’ll be there.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some of the lowest-polling candidates, always looking for a breakthrough moment, have seized on almost any public mention as evidence that opponents are terrified of their “momentum.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“BREAKING: The GOP just attacked Seth,” an email from Mr. Moulton’s campaign declared June 3, citing <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/GOP/status/1135303827949850624" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a tweet</a> of the sort the Republican National Committee posts about any Democratic candidate who goes on TV. “Rush $10 — Click here to fight back against the GOP attacks. Maggie, the GOP and their wealthy donors are scared of Seth.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several candidates hovering near 1 percent in the polls have declared that one survey or another showed them in the “top 10.” In most cases, what they meant was that fewer than 10 people had more than 1 percent support, leaving a large cluster of marginal contenders tied for, say, ninth place. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By this standard, in many polls, 15 or more candidates can claim to be in the top 10.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hyperbole is also popular in subject lines. “INCREDIBLE news” can mean, as it did in an email from Mr. Bennet’s campaign May 18, “Michael only announced his candidacy two weeks ago but he’s already met the polling threshold in two of the three qualifying polls he needs!!!” (The threshold is 1 percent, and one of the polls had been released more than two months earlier.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But nobody has been more hyperbolic more consistently than Julián Castro. In my inbox, he bore little resemblance to <!-- -->the mild-mannered candidate hoping to break out from the back of the pack that <!-- -->I had seen in real life.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The digital version of Mr. Castro was theatrically shocked <!-- -->by modest success<!-- -->: “I’m so stunned, I can barely type this email,” he wrote on two separate days in response to the <!-- -->same news<!-- --> about his donor numbers. Other miracles abounded. “No one — NO ONE — saw this coming,” read one subject line. “Shocking update: (please read!!)” <!-- -->went<!-- --> another. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And then there was Mr. Castro’s end-zone dance after reaching 65,000 donors to guarantee his spot in the first debates: <!-- -->“Because of you, our campaign just skyrocketed to become one of the select few that’s going to be on that Democratic debate stage.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Twenty of the 24 candidates will be on the debate stage.</p>
