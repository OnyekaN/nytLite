A series of public events signaled the arrival of a new cultural moment, one in which Americans are ready to discuss past sins. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The most prominent of these occurred on Wednesday, when a House Judiciary subcommittee <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/politics/slavery-reparations-hearing.html?module=inline" title="">held a hearing</a> on a bill that would commission a study on reparations. The meeting took place on Juneteenth, a day commemorating the announcement of the end of slavery in the United States. The hearing also came five years after the author Ta-Nehisi Coates, who testified before the subcommittee, helped rekindle the reparations debate with his essay “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Case for Reparations.</a>”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">[<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Read the </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/ta-nehisi-coates-reparations.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">full remarks by Ta-Nehisi Coates</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em>]</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Coates and others have traced racial disparities in wealth, health and criminal justice to government policies and decades of indifference.

No other way to describe it. And that’s the way it needs to be described in the history books.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The governor’s executive order has been called the first broad-based state apology for atrocities against Native Americans. In another effort, Maine has created a reconciliation commission, which Mr. Newsom also plans to do in California, as a repository for stories and scholarship.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But a similar apology to African-Americans for the sins of slavery and other crimes — whether at the state or federal level — must be seen as only a starting point, international human rights experts say.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There should be a really serious apology, and it would have to be made by the president and have buy-in from governors of all states that slaves were ever held,” <!-- -->said Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann of Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario.<!-- --> “And it would have to be done very, very seriously, with a lot of ritual, and include representatives of descendants of slaves.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She said that African-American leaders would have to approve the text, and that it would have to show “good faith,” which would mean including reparations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">[<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Read what </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/business/economy/reparations-slavery.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">reparations for slavery might look like in 2019</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em>]</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Howard-Hassmann, who has studied the reparations <!-- -->paid to Japanese-Americans<!-- -->, said that compensation for descendants of slaves would have to be collective reparations that would go toward improving schools and health care, or funds granted to predominantly African-American areas.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Then you have to accept that there are children who will benefit who are not direct descendants of enslaved people,” she said, adding that there would also have to be many more memorials and museums built to honor slaves.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The challenges that African-American claimants of reparations face, according to Ms. Howard-Hassmann, are many: that the victims of the direct harm are dead, that the perpetrators are diffuse, and that some of the actual harms were legal at the time they were committed. <!-- -->Some estimates of the reparations due<!-- --> exceed $1 trillion.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There is no template for providing reparations to descendants of enslaved African-Americans, but Americans have received compensation for historical injustices before.
