<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">YAKAWLANG, Afghanistan — The girls began appearing about seven in the morning. Seen from a distance, they made up thin blue lines snaking across the barren tan mountainside along narrow trails traced in the dirt, converging from several directions on the little school in the bottom of the valley.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wearing powder blue school uniforms and white head scarves, many of the girls, ages 7 to 18, had already been walking for an hour or more by the time they arrived at the school. There were smaller groups of boys, too, mostly out of uniform, walking apart from the girls.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By 7:45, they were all gathered for assembly in the yard of the Rustam School, in a remote corner of Afghanistan’s Yakawlang District. It is the area’s only high school, years 1 through 12, and has an enrollment of 330 girls and 146 boys — astonishing in a country where normally <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.unicef.org/afghanistan/media/2471/file/afg-report-oocs2018.pdf%20.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">only a third</a> of girls attend school.</p><p class="g-pstyle0">BAMIYAN</p><p class="g-pstyle1">YAKAWLANG</p><p class="g-pstyle1">DISTRICT</p><p class="g-pstyle2">Kabul</p><p class="g-pstyle3">AFGHANISTAN</p><p class="g-pstyle4">50 MILES</p><p class="g-pstyle5">TAJIK.</p><p class="g-pstyle5">UZBEK.</p><p class="g-pstyle5">TURKMENISTAN</p><p class="g-pstyle6">Area of</p><p class="g-pstyle6">detail</p><p class="g-pstyle7">AFGHANISTAN</p><p class="g-pstyle8">Kandahar</p><p class="g-pstyle5">PAKISTAN</p><p class="g-pstyle4">200 MILES</p><p class="css-1g8gl4z interactive-credit" data-testid="credit" id="interactive-credit">By The New York Times</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The principal, Mohammad Sadiq Nasiri, 49, gave his daily pep talk: Getting into university is going to be harder than ever this year, so they are going to have to do better than ever.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rustam may seem an unlikely place to encourage collegiate dreams. With seven crude stone classrooms, supplemented by six big tents, there are so many students that they are divided into morning and afternoon sessions only four hours long.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There is no electricity, heat, working computers or copy machines. Many school materials are written out in longhand by teachers. Foreign aid once helped but has dried up. One teacher said she has fewer books than students.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only 5 percent of the students have parents who can read and write, Mr. Nasiri said. Most are the children of subsistence farmers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet Rustam’s 2017 graduating class saw 60 of 65 graduates accepted to Afghanistan’s public universities, a 92 percent college entrance rate. Two-thirds of those accepted were girls. A couple of years earlier, 97 percent of the graduates went to college.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unlike most Afghan schools, Rustam mixes boys and girls in its classrooms. “Men and women are equal,” the principal said. “They have the same brains and the same bodies.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added, “We tell these boys and girls, there is no difference between you guys, and you will all be together when you go to college, so you need to learn how to respect one another.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One day late in the spring term, Badan Joya, one of five female teachers among the school’s 12, was teaching a fourth-grade math class in one of the overflow tents. A piece of cardboard painted black served as a chalkboard, with simple algebra formulas scribbled on it. She asked her students, nearly all girls, to name their favorite subject. They chorused: “Math.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That is not surprising at Rustam; 40 percent of questions on the college entrance exams cover mathematics, more than any other subject. And the girls excel.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The head student in 11th-grade math, based on test scores, is Shahrbano Hakimi, 17. Ms. Hakimi is also head student in her computer class, where, on that recent day, the girls were studying the Windows operating system, from books. Only one of the 60 students had a computer at home.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The thing I wish for most in the world,” Ms. Hakimi said, “is a laptop.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, girls’ education was banned and women were mostly confined to their homes, especially in rural areas like this one in Bamiyan Province.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The local passion for education, especially among girls, is a reaction to that era, their teachers said. The fourth-grade math teacher, Ms. Joya, who is 28, did not begin school herself until the Taliban fell when she was 11; she could not read or write, and her only schooling had been sewing class.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I had to start from zero,” she said. “We tell them about the Taliban and what they did to us, and say, ‘You have an opportunity now, you should take it,’” she said. “They’re listening. They hear about it at home, too, from their mothers and aunts.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The area around Rustam is now free of Taliban and little touched by violence. In other places, families are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/world/asia/afghanistan-schools-taliban.html?module=inline" title="">reluctant to send girls</a> to school, especially over long distances in rural parts.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The girls at Rustam are highly motivated. “Honestly, girls are better than boys, they are more serious,” Mr. Nasiri said. “These kids all know that you can’t make a slave out of someone who is educated.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Except in Islamic studies, nearly all head students are girls.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Amina, “nearly 18,” who uses one name, is head girl of the entire school. She is fortunate, she said, because her father is educated, though her mother is illiterate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She will be the first of eight siblings to finish high school and hopes to go to Mawoud Academy in Kabul, a college preparatory school, even though she knows that 40 students were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/world/asia/afghanistan-students-bombing.html?module=inline" title="">killed there recently </a>by a suicide bomber.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Amina’s favorite subject is math; she hopes to become a doctor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Hakimi also dreams of becoming a doctor, in part because her mother suffers vision problems and her father is nearly deaf at age 65. Both are illiterate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outside their mud-walled home, a water wheel on a nearby irrigation ditch turns a small generator, just enough to power lights at night, for studying.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m not educated,” said her father, Ghulam Hussein. “I’m just a farm laborer. I don’t want them to have the same life.” Of his 11 children, a son and two daughters have already reached college.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I am so proud of them,” said Zenat, Ms. Hakimi’s mother.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their family is also an example of why fewer boys are in school. Their son Ali, 9, stays home to help his parents, while their son Reza, 12, works in the fields. “Ali wants so badly to go to school,” Zenat said. “Maybe next year.” All the daughters, though, are in school.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One day Mr. Nasiri, the principal, noticed one of his students, 13-year-old Friba, hiding behind other girls during assembly because she was out of uniform. Her family was too poor to buy one. So he bought a swatch of blue cotton in the nearest bazaar; Ms. Joya, the math teacher, sewed a tunic from it, using her Taliban-era skills.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Nasiri borrowed the money for the cotton. He earns less than $200 a month.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to running Rustam the past six years, Mr. Nasiri supported four daughters and two sons with his wife, Roya, 45. They married during Taliban times; he taught his wife to read and write.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We discussed it and decided she should go to school,” he said. “Children will do better when their mom is educated.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their eldest daughter finished high school four years before her mother. This year Roya graduated from high school, and next year will take the college entrance exams, Mr. Nasiri said proudly. “She raised six children,” he said. “Now she raises herself.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hundreds of feet up a rocky mountainside opposite Rustam, sheep grazed, watched by shepherds. One of the shepherds wore a blue dress, much like a school uniform, but covered in dust. Her name is Nikbakht, she said; she is 13. She carried a pen and a workbook for the Pashto language.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I love school, but no one else was home so I had to work with the animals.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pashto, a required subject, is not her favorite, Nikbakht said. Math is.</p>
