A partial lunar eclipse will be visible to people across South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. (In the United States, we will miss most of the show.) This cosmic coincidence is a reminder of some of the awe we feel when looking up at the night sky, and some of what inspired America’s race to the moon. While humanity’s eventual lunar return may be some years off, there are many more events in the decades to come that will draw attention back toward our majestic moon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/science/lunar-eclipse-supermoon.html?module=inline" title="">Lunar eclipses</a>, when Earth moves between the moon and the sun, are enjoyable nighttime astronomical extravaganzas.

It will occasionally pass in front of the shining dots and momentarily block them from our view in what is known as an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/science/occultation-moon-mars-venus-mercury.html?module=inline" title="">occultation</a>. During an occultation, the moon essentially acts as a guide, leading you to cosmic bodies that you might otherwise overlook. A proper telescope is often needed for the best of these viewings. But if you can learn to use one — or attend a public astronomy event — the show can be worth the trouble.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Saturn, the ringed planet, and our moon have already crossed paths a number of times this year and will continue to do so on several more occasions. This illustrates how occultations typically occur in a series, with the moon tracking objects — some millions of miles away and others hundreds of light years away — as they move across our night skies during Earth’s trip around the sun.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sunlight reflected from Saturn travels <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.space.com/18477-how-far-away-is-saturn.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">more than 746 million miles</a> to get to Earth.
