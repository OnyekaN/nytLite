<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany insisted on Wednesday that she was “well” and capable of fulfilling her job after she was seen shaking uncontrollably in public for the third time in less than a month, reviving concern about her health.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In videos of the event, she was seen struggling to remain still as her arms and legs began trembling while she stood beside Antti Rinne, the prime minister of Finland, watching a military honor guard.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As she had in the previous incidents, Ms. Merkel clasped her hands in front of her in an apparently futile attempt to contain the tremors.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Speaking to reporters less than an hour later during a news briefing, Ms. Merkel said, “I am well.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pressed by a reporter for more of an explanation, Ms. Merkel said that the shaking on Wednesday was part of the psychological trauma she suffered after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=HHfvJfVzw50" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">experiencing uncontrolled trembling under similar circumstances on June 18</a>, while appearing with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in the full afternoon sun.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I was clear in saying that I am doing well and I think that can be accepted,” the chancellor said on Wednesday. “I said that I’m trying to come to grips with standing out there shaking while Mr. Zelensky visited and I think it’s going to blow over sometime soon.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She added: “I’m not yet there yet, but I’m convinced that I am quite capable of doing my work.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A government spokesman deferred to Ms. Merkel’s comments and provided no additional information.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her aides attributed the initial shaking to dehydration, a problem that has plagued the chancellor in the past. After that episode, she also appeared at a news conference a short time later and told reporters that she had drunk several glasses of water and was doing fine.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/world/europe/angela-merkel-shaking.html?module=inline" title="">the trembling returned nine days later</a>, when she stood alongside the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, during a ceremony in the presidential palace. Although her aides again said that she was well, it became more of a concern. She later explained that episode as linked to what had happened during Mr. Zelensky’s visit.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/world/europe/angela-merkel-trembling-germany.html?module=inline" title="">Germans prize privacy</a> and the chancellor’s health is not usually a matter of public interest. But the trembling on Wednesday quickly shot to the top of online news sites and was discussed on 24-hour news channels.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I must live with this for a little while,” Ms. Merkel said. “But I think that just as it has come, it will go away again.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Barbara L. Milrod, a psychiatrist at Weill Cornell Medicine, a medical school in New York, watched a video of Mrs. Merkel’s shaking and said that it did not look like an emotional or psychologically based symptom. A panic attack was unlikely, Dr. Milrod said, because those tend to be virtually invisible.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But of course she would have to be examined” to make any valid determination, Dr. Milrod said.</p>
