<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Update: On Friday, Israel said it would allow Representative Rashida Tlaib</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/world/middleeast/israel-rashida-tlaib.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to enter the West Bank to visit her grandmother</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is difficult to stomach the notion that an American president would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1162000480681287683" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">put pressure</a> on Israel to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/world/middleeast/trump-israel-omar-tlaib.html?module=inline" title="">deny entry</a> to two members of the United States Congress.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are not many traditions of decorum that President Trump has not trampled on since entering the White House. But to put at risk, so cynically, America’s special relationship with Israel solely to titillate the bigots in his base, to lean so crassly on a foreign leader to punish his own political adversaries, to demonstrate so foul a lack of respect for the most elemental democratic principles, is new territory even for him.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though facing a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/opinion/israel-election.html?module=inline" title="">difficult election next month</a> for which he sorely needs the support of his fractured right-wing base, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was said to be leaning toward allowing Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan to travel through Israel “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/15/israel-brink-grave-misstep/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">out of respect for the U.S. Congress and the great alliance between Israel and America</a>,” as his ambassador to <!-- -->Washington<!-- -->, Ron Dermer, wisely said last month. But, on Thursday, Mr. Netanyahu <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-netanyahu-decides-to-bar-tlaib-omar-from-entering-israel-1.7687973" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cravenly bowed</a> before the pressure from Mr. Trump.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep. Tlaib to visit,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. “They hate Israel &amp; all Jewish people, &amp; there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sad, to borrow one of Mr. Trump’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/03/47-things-that-have-made-donald-trump-sad-since-he-launched-his-campaign/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">favorite words</a>. How sad that two leaders — each desperate to look tough to his own base — are risking a bipartisan relationship built between these two nations over generations. Only weak leaders would risk so much for a reward so negligible. To what end? To win a few political points against two of the newest members of Congress? To capture a few news cycles? To dial up the outrage machine just one more notch? Confident leaders would never have risked so much for so little.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though many American presidents have sought to influence Israeli decisions throughout the history of the <!-- -->Arab-Israeli<!-- --> conflict, they usually did so <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0913.html?module=inline" title="">diplomatically</a> — and to advance America’s interests. Mr. Trump, by contrast, leaned on Mr. Netanyahu as he would on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1161719408202584064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1161719409804808193&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vanityfair.com%2Fnews%2F2019%2F08%2Fdonald-trump-clueless-jay-powell" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">one of his own appointees</a>, in broad view, and in direct violation of what the president of the United States should be doing when democratically elected lawmakers are threatened with a blockade by an allied leader.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There can be, and has been, considerable debate over what the two congresswomen, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress and both sharp critics of the Israeli government, have said and done. They have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/us/politics/ilhan-omar-rashida-tlaib-israel.html?module=inline" title="">supported</a> the controversial Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (B.D.S.) movement aimed at pressuring Israel into ending its occupation of the West Bank, a movement that some Jews have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/magazine/battle-over-bds-israel-palestinians-antisemitism.html?module=inline" title="">deemed to be anti-Semitic</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet, from the outset, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/opinion/trump-rally-send-her-back.html?module=inline" title="">Mr. Trump has pounced</a> on the <!-- -->religion and background<!-- --> of the two congresswomen to fan racial divisions. Ms. Omar and Ms. Tlaib were two of the four congresswomen of color, along with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who Mr. Trump said should <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150381394234941448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1150381394234941448&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2019%2F7%2F15%2F20694616%2Fdonald-trump-racist-tweets-omar-aoc-tlaib-pressley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“go back” to the countries they came from</a>, giving rise to chants of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/trump-send-her-back-ilhan-omar.html?module=inline" title="">“send her back”</a> at a subsequent Trump political rally.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The visit Ms. Omar and Ms. Tlaib were contemplating was not to Israel proper, but to the West Bank, where they were to visit Hebron, Ramallah and Bethlehem, as well as Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, on a trip co-sponsored by a <!-- -->Palestinian organization<!-- -->, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.miftah.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Miftah</a>, that promotes “global awareness and knowledge of Palestinian realities.” A visit was planned to the Al Aqsa Mosque, on what Israelis call the Temple Mount, an especially volatile site in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. <!-- -->There is little question that their visit would have focused on Palestinian grievances over the Israeli occupation. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All that was clearly troublesome for Mr. Netanyahu, especially the support of the congresswomen for the B.D.S. movement. A relatively recent law allows the Israeli government to deny entry to supporters of the movement; it was this law that the government used to deny entry to the representatives.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In April the United States <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/world/middleeast/barghouti-bds-israel-palestinian.html?module=inline" title="">barred</a> Omar Barghouti, one of the co-founders of the B.D.S. movement, from entering the country when he was scheduled to deliver a series of talks and attend his daughter’s wedding. Other American public figures have been detained by Israeli authorities, ostensibly because of their political views, including the IfNotNow founder, Simone Zimmerman, who was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/08/ifnotnow-co-founder-simone-zimmerman-detained-in-israel.html?gtm=bottom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">held at the border</a>; a B.D.S. advocate, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/prominent-jewish-bds-activist-denied-entry-to-israel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Ariel Gold</a>, who was denied entry to the country; and the journalist <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Left-wing-columnist-Peter-Beinart-detained-at-Ben-Gurion-airport-564778" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Peter Beinart</a>, who was held at the airport. Mr. Netanyahu later called Mr. Beinart’s detention a “mistake.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet contrary to Mr. Trump’s tweet, it is blocking entry by two American legislators who are critics of Israel that shows great weakness, especially after Israel hosted visits by delegations of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/heads-of-republican-democrat-delegation-agree-omar-tlaib-should-visit-israel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">31 Republican and 41 Democratic lawmakers</a> this month. It has long been Israel’s mantra that critics of its policies should come see for themselves, and the country is certainly strong enough to handle any criticism from two members of Congress. Mr. Trump has done Israel no favor.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
