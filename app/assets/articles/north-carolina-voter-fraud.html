<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">ELIZABETHTOWN, N.C. — The Republican competing in the do-over race in North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District has been running <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&amp;v=ZawY_sPXfeg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">an ad featuring circus music</a> and wobbling clown dolls. The dolls, he says in the commercial, represent “the crazy liberal clowns” of today’s Democratic Party.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They’re not funny,” the candidate, state Senator Dan Bishop, declares. “They’re downright scary.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Affixed to the clown heads are the faces of some of the opposing party’s more left-leaning national stars, including Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. Another prominent face is that of Mr. Bishop’s Democratic opponent, Dan McCready — a Marine combat veteran who does not support Nancy Pelosi as House speaker and whose motto is “country over party.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This rare redo election, set for Sept. 10, has emerged as an opportunity for Republicans to battle-test a 2020 strategy that seeks to stuff all Democrats, even the most moderate ones, into a sort of conceptual clown car driven, as another of Mr. Bishop’s ads puts it, by “socialists” and “radicals” who “hate the values that make America great.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">State officials called for the new contest in February after evidence surfaced that the 2018 campaign of the previous Republican candidate, Mark Harris, had funded an illegal vote-harvesting scheme in rural Bladen County. The head of the state elections board called it “a tainted election” — an embarrassment for Republicans and for Mr. Harris, who is sitting out the new race for what he said are health reasons.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since then, Republicans have argued that an even greater danger to America has surfaced in the Democratic Party.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">President Trump has laid the groundwork for the strategy with his racially inflammatory attacks on four liberal first-term Democrats in Congress, all of whom are women of color. And the message that Democrats are not just wrong, but crazy or even dangerous, is now central to Republican campaigns in a number of battleground districts around the country, as well as in governor’s races this year in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/elections/article_7d9f99e6-acb1-11e9-979b-bfbe3be16410.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Louisiana</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rga.org/rga-releases-new-digital-ads-introducing-democrats-in-mississippi-governors-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Mississippi</a> that feature Democratic candidates more moderate than Mr. McCready.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the same time, the message has been consistently reinforced by Republicans of national stature like Donald Trump Jr., the president’s oldest son, who on Tuesday sent out a fund-raising email with the subject line “Democrats vs. America,” in which he said the party “hates the American flag” and, among other things, “promotes terrorism.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In North Carolina’s Ninth District, which covers part of Charlotte and a number of exurban and rural counties to the east, Mr. Bishop’s attacks on Mr. McCready come amid a notable lack of repentance among area Republicans for the allegations of electoral fraud in rural Bladen County.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The man at the center of the allegations, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/us/mcrae-dowless-indicted.html?module=inline" title="">L. McCrae Dowless Jr., was charged</a> in February in connection with misconduct related to absentee ballots during a 2016 election and the 2018 primary. And on Tuesday, he was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/mccrae-dowless-indictment.html?module=inline" title="">charged with obstruction of justice</a> and illegal possession of an absentee ballot, among other crimes, in connection with the midterm election that was overturned.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Inside Mr. Dowless’s fly-by-night operation to </em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/us/north-carolina-voter-fraud.html?module=inline"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/us/north-carolina-voter-fraud.html?module=inline" title="">harvest ballots</a></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> in North Carolina]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Charles Ray Peterson, the Republican chairman of the county commission, noted that Mr. Dowless had previously run get-out-the-vote operations for Democrats, too. Earlier this month, the county Republican Party posted a Facebook message that accused Democrats of election chicanery: “Please just vote,” it said. “It takes a lot of Republicans to out vote all of the living, dead and illegal Democrats.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A recent poll leaked to reporters and conducted on behalf of Mr. McCready’s campaign <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/454122-contested-nc-house-race-in-dead-heat-internal-poll" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">showed</a> the race tied among likely voters. But a key question is whether a window of opportunity has closed for Mr. McCready, who fell short in the midterm by fewer than 1,000 votes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The district has not elected a Democrat to the seat since 1962, and Mr. Trump won the district by more than 11 percentage points in 2016. Some Republican observers are hoping that the anti-Trump tide that allowed Democrats to retake the House in November has receded. They also feel more confident that the new nationwide message painting Democrats as out of touch has changed the narrative in their favor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’re no longer talking about mean, nasty Republicans,” said Larry Shaheen, a Republican political strategist who supports Mr. Bishop. Now it’s, are we electing a socialist Democrat or a capitalist Republican?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Bishop, 55, is well suited to the task of pressing an aggressive case against Mr. McCready and his fellow Democrats. An accomplished corporate lawyer from Charlotte, he has served in both the state House and Senate, emerging as one of the more controversial and combative members of a Republican-led Legislature that aggressively sought to give traditionally moderate North Carolina a shove to the right.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think I am reputed to be something of a battler in the General Assembly,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Three years ago, Mr. Bishop was the sponsor of House Bill 2. Before it was repealed, the legislation, known nationally as the “Bathroom Bill,” plunged the state into political chaos with its requirement that transgender people use restrooms in government and public buildings that correspond with the gender on their birth certificate. The furor over the bill, and the threats of corporate boycotts and canceled sports events, helped deliver a Democrat, Roy Cooper, to the governor’s mansion, but Mr. Bishop boasted of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article73581522.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">standing up</a> to the “radical transgender agenda.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, since easily winning the Republican primary in the current race, Mr. Bishop has not particularly emphasized H.B. 2, saying that voters were “tired” of the controversy. In an interview last week, Mr. Bishop instead stressed his role in the sound fiscal management of the state, which he says has allowed for surpluses, teacher pay increases and new funds for road construction.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My basic view of it is practicing good fiscal management on a good, disciplined basis over an extended period of time produces great results,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in his tours around the district, Mr. Bishop said, it became apparent to him that voters were most interested in “the extremes seen on the left and people openly embracing socialism,” although he said this concern may have been stoked by his own messaging: “We may have a chicken-and-egg issue,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://votedanbishop.com/issues/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">campaign website</a> touts his A rating from the National Rifle Association and his support for Mr. Trump’s border wall. Mr. Bishop spoke briefly at Mr. Trump’s July 17 rally in Greenville, N.C., where he pledged to support the president, and where the crowd chanted, “Send her back!” after Mr. Trump mentioned Ms. Omar, the Democratic representative from Minnesota, who was born in Somalia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I didn’t think it was too great,” Mr. Bishop said in the interview, referring to the chant. He chalked it up to the kinds of “mistakes in rhetoric” that both Democrats and Republicans occasionally make.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His opponent, Mr. McCready, enjoys a pronounced <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2020&amp;id=NC09&amp;spec=Y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">money advantage</a> in the race, with more than $1.7 million in cash on hand at the end of June, compared to about $345,000 for Mr. Bishop. Mr. McCready is also a known quantity in much of the district after campaigning for the seat for 27 months.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On a recent weeknight, Mr. McCready, 36, was in a fire hall in Union County, southeast of Charlotte, chatting up a room full of African-American preachers, many of whom he had met before the midterms. The coming vote, he told them, was “the people’s chance to get justice” for a scheme that “targeted” older, black and Native American voters.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We ran into what we now know is the largest case of election fraud in recent American history,” he said. “When we ran into that, I chose to fight.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. McCready is hoping his military service and his record as a businessman — he helped start a solar power company — will be a strong selling point, along with a generally friendly, if not downright mellow, demeanor. (At a recent fund-raiser he was captured on video with an acoustic guitar playing a version of Simon and Garfunkel’s “America.”)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But despite repeated promises to work across party lines, he has also taken shots at Mr. Bishop, at one point saying that voters “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article230398529.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">should be terrified</a>” of the possibility of Mr. Bishop going to Washington. He has criticized Mr. Bishop over H.B. 2, with an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article231538963.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">emphasis</a> on the jobs and money the state stood to lose from the boycotts and negative attention.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like many of the Democratic candidates for president, Mr. McCready has put more of a priority on policy proposals, including a seven-point health care plan that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://mediaweb.wsoctv.com/document_dev/2019/07/23/McCreadyPlan_15978208_ver1.0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">includes support</a> for expanding Medicaid in North Carolina under the Affordable Health Act — a move Mr. Bishop opposes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At Bladen Hardware in Elizabethtown, a city of about 3,500 people, big questions about the direction of the country seemed to be on people’s minds. Austin Adams, 24, a clerk at the store, said he plans to vote for Mr. McCready so he could help serve as a check on Mr. Trump.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I love my country,” he said, “But that whole nationalism, it kind of closes people off and it divides.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The store sells a good deal of firearms, and Mr. Adams said that many customers have come in worried about the country drifting leftward and impinging on their rights as gun owners.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s what I hear a lot around here,” he said. “A lot of people say the left is straight crazy.”</p>
