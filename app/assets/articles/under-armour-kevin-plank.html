<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The struggling sportswear giant Under Armour said Tuesday that its chief executive, Kevin Plank, was stepping down from the role he had held since starting the company in his grandmother’s basement more than 20 years ago. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under Armour, which largely focuses on making high-tech shoes and apparel for athletes, has faltered while the revenues of its rivals Nike and Adidas have grown thanks to surging consumer interest in athleisure wear. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company, which had $5 billion in sales in 2018, has seen its once-robust profit turn into net losses of more than $46 million in each of the last two fiscal years. Last year, it <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/10/22/business/ap-us-under-armour-ceo.html?module=inline" title="">cut around 400 jobs</a> to streamline a business suffering from slowing growth. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under Armour’s stock peaked around $52 in September 2015, but is currently trading around $20. It rose 2.6 percent in early trading Tuesday after the announcement about Mr. Plank, who will remain at the company in an executive role. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By contrast, shares of Nike, with more than $39 billion in revenue for the year that ended in May, nearly doubled in that same time, currently trading at a high of $96. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent years, Under Armour’s issues have gone beyond industry struggles, and Mr. Plank has found himself in the middle of several controversies. In 2017, he<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/business/media/advertising-celebrities-activism.html?module=inline" title=""> was criticized </a>by some of his company’s celebrity endorsers, including Stephen Curry and Dwayne Johnson, when he said in an interview that President Trump’s business background made him “a real asset” to the country. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Plank responded by taking out a full-page newspaper ad that indicated his comments “did not accurately reflect my intent.” Later that year, he was one of several chief executives who <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/business/merck-ceo-trump-charlottesville.html?module=inline" title="">resigned from a presidential business council</a> over Mr. Trump’s response to the racist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Va. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Wall Street Journal <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-armours-metoo-moment-no-more-strip-clubs-on-company-dime-1541450209" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reported last year that the company</a> had a culture of inappropriate behavior toward women, including visits to strip clubs that often included Mr. Plank and were charged to corporate cards. In response, Mr. Plank said, “We can and will do better.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two top executives in sports marketing who were long part of Mr. Plank’s inner circle were ousted late last year after an internal investigation into spending inside the department, according to The Wall Street Journal. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This year, Under Armour’s board asked Mr. Plank about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-under-armour-ceos-unusual-adviser-an-msnbc-anchor-11550763306" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">his close ties to the MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle</a>, who had reportedly given him business advice and flown on Mr. Plank’s private jet, The Wall Street Journal reported. Mr. Plank reportedly told the directors that his relationship was a private matter and that no company funds were involved<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Patrik Frisk<!-- -->, Under Armour’s president and chief operating officer, will become the chief executive on Jan. 1, the company said. He will continue serving as president. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Plank, 47, is not going far. Under Armour said Mr. Frisk, 56, would report directly to him. Mr. Plank will now hold the titles of executive chairman and brand chief. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think Kevin is going to hand off the day-to-day activities to Patrik, but he’s still going to be involved in the big-picture ideas as head of brand,” said Matt Powell, a senior analyst with research firm NPD Group.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under Armour, which Mr. Plank began in 1996 while he was a student at the University of Maryland, where he also played football, established itself as a favorite of athletes. The company designed apparel that helped regulate body temperature or wicked away moisture during workouts or games. One garment, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/mens-ua-recover-fleece-full-zip/pid1348407-014" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a men’s zip-up fleece that sells for $100</a>, claims that a pattern inside the fabric “returns infrared energy to your body, boosting localized blood flow and increasing the amount of oxygen reaching your muscles to restore your muscles faster.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Soon its roster of endorsers included well-known athletes like Mr. Curry, a star player for the Golden State Warriors; the golfer Jordan Spieth; and Tom Brady, the quarterback for the New England Patriots, along with crossover stars like Mr. Johnson and the ballerina Misty Copeland.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under Armour has also pushed hard into collegiate and high school sports, providing uniforms and equipment for football teams across the country. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Analysts cast Tuesday’s announcement as part of an evolution inside Under Armour, noting that it gives Mr. Plank more time to spend on his outside interests, which include real estate development and ownership of a thoroughbred horse farm and Sagamore Spirit rye whiskey.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Powell credited Mr. Frisk with putting Under Armour on better ground operationally in recent months, getting a better hand on the company’s inventory levels and reducing production to help the company run more efficiently.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Frisk joined Under Armour in 2017 as its president and chief operating officer from the Aldo Group, a footwear and accessories company, where he had been the chief executive.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement, Mr. Plank said of Mr. Frisk: “As my partner during the most transformative chapter in our history, he has been exceptional in his ability to translate our brand’s vision into world-class execution by focusing on our long-term strategy and re-engineering our ecosystem through a strategic, operational and cultural transformation.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, Mr. Plank looms large over the company, and Under Armour has become a major presence in Baltimore, where it is based, sometimes to the consternation of others. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In June 2016, Under Armour bought land in the city’s Port Covington area for its new headquarters for $70.3 million. The parcels had been bought in 2014 by an entity controlled by Mr. Plank, Sagamore Development, for $35 million, resulting in various lawsuits claiming that he was enriching himself at the expense of Under Armour shareholders.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Plank said that he had made no money from the deal, and that Sagamore had spent an additional $36 million above the purchase price terminating a lease and in development costs. The lawsuits are continuing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This summer, Mr. Plank defended Baltimore after Mr. Trump, in an attack on Representative Elijah E. Cummings, who died last week at age 68, called the district a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On his <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0egGsyg5wN/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">personal</a> Instagram account, Mr. Plank posted an old Under Armour commercial that spoke to the pride the company and its employees had for the city.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Under Armour still needs to determine how to turn around a business that has stalled in recent years after a stratospheric first two decades. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Consumers are not buying sports shoes with the intention to play sports,” Mr. Powell, the analyst, said. “Under Armour remains far too focused on the performance athlete, and that is a very small subset of the market.”</p>
