<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WASHINGTON — Amy McGrath, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel and combat pilot who was a star Democratic candidate in 2018 but failed to capture a House seat in Kentucky, announced Tuesday that she would seek to take on Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, for his seat in 2020.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. McGrath, 44, made her announcement with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d3skEMCIgU&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a dark video</a> denouncing Mr. McConnell, 77, who was first elected to the Senate in 1984 and has served as the central ballast for President Trump in Washington.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Everything that’s wrong in Washington had to start someplace,” Ms. McGrath says in the video. “It started with this man who was elected a lifetime ago, and who has, bit by bit, year by year, turned Washington into something we all despise.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She also reprised a story she used in her 2018 campaign against Representative Andy Barr, in which she recounted that as a young woman she wrote to Mr. McConnell “telling him I wanted to fly fighter jets in combat, to fight for my country, and that women should be able to do that,” and noting that he never wrote back.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. McConnell, whose team has been anticipating Ms. McGrath’s announcement for months, responded with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMbqhRvmNkI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">his own video</a> with quotes culled from her House campaign, in which she expressed support for things like a single-payer health care system and abortion rights — positions he believes will be largely unpopular in his conservative state.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Amy McGrath lost her only race in a Democratic wave election because she is an extreme liberal who is far out of touch with Kentuckians,” said Kevin Golden, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell’s re-election campaign.</p>
