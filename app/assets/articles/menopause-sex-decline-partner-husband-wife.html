<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For many women, sex after menopause is not as satisfying as it used to be. But is menopause entirely to blame?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New research suggests that the hormonal changes that come with menopause are only part of the reason a woman’s sex life declines with age. It’s true that many women experience symptoms after menopause, including vaginal dryness, painful intercourse and loss of desire — all of which can affect the frequency and pleasure of sex.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the new study shows that the reasons many women stop wanting sex, enjoying sex and having sex are far more complex. While women traditionally have been blamed when sex wanes in a relationship, the research shows that, often, it’s the health of a woman’s partner that determines whether she remains sexually active and satisfied with her sex life. (Most studies have focused entirely on heterosexual women, so less is known about same-sex couples after menopause.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We know that menopause seems to have a bad effect on libido, vaginal dryness and sexual pain,” said Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of t<!-- -->he Mayo Clinic Center for Women’s Health<!-- --> in Rochester, Minn. “But what is coming up as a consistent finding is that the partner has such a prominent role. It’s not just the availability of the partner — it’s the physical health of the partner as well.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Abstract/publishahead/Sexual_functioning_in_4,418_postmenopausal_women.97351.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">latest study</a>, published in the medical journal Menopause, is based on surveys of more than 24,000 women taking part in an ovarian cancer screening study in Britain. The women, aged 50 to 74, answered multiple-choice health questionnaires about their sex lives at the start of the study. But the survey data are unique because about 4,500 of the women also left written comments, giving researchers a trove of new insights about women’s sex lives. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over all, 78 percent of the women surveyed said they had an intimate partner, but fewer than half the women (49.2 percent) said they had active sex lives. The women’s written answers about why they stopped having sex revealed the pain and sadness behind the percentages.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The main reason was losing a partner to death or divorce, which was cited by 37 percent of the women. (Women who were not having sex cited multiple reasons for the decline, which is why the percentages exceed 100.) </p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">‘‘I have been a widow for 17 years.

About one in four women (23 percent) said the lack of sex was because of their partner’s physical problems, and 11 percent of women blamed their own physical problems.</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">“He does not maintain erection strong enough for penetration (after prostate surgery and diabetes).

We both get tired, but when we do it, it’s good.” </em></strong>(Age 64)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The data and comments were analyzed by Dr. Helena Harder, a research fellow at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, and colleagues. Dr. Harder said the comments show that doctors need to have more frequent conversations with women about sex. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Women say that they are sorry that things have changed. They wish it was different,” says Dr. Harder. “But in general, it’s not being brought up in discussions. Patients need reassurance that it’s O.K. to discuss sex and ask questions. If you do that, it’s probably a good step toward making changes.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Faubion, who is also medical director for the North American Menopause Society, notes that treatments are available to help women with vaginal dryness and painful sex. In addition, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/health/vyleesi-libido-women.html?module=inline" title="">two libido drugs</a> have been approved to help increase female desire. One is a pill and the other, an injectable, should be available this fall, although both drugs have drawbacks, including cost, limits on when they can be used and side effects, so they aren’t an option for every woman, she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A better option may be educating women and couples. Working with a sex therapist can help women deal with anxiety and low-desire issues. A therapist can help teach women that while spontaneous sexual desire may dim, they can plan for sex, and desire often returns once a woman is engaged in intimacy. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nan Dill, a 53-year-old Cincinnati woman with three children aged 15, 18 and 21, said it wasn’t until her doctor asked her questions about her sex life that she realized how hot flashes and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/well/getting-an-invite-to-the-libido-party.html?module=inline" title="">low desire related to menopause</a> had taken a toll on her sex life. “I thought, ‘Life is busy. This is what happens,’ ” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Dill began using an estrogen patch for hot flashes and a non-estrogen vaginal dryness treatment. Learning that changes in desire are normal helped both her and her husband understand that they were simply entering a new chapter in their relationship.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“When you have the right information, it helps you understand the change not just in your body but the change in your bedroom,” she said. “You learn sex might be different, but it will still be good, and it will still work for both of you.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p>
