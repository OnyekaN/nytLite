<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Chile’s Atacama Desert, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/oldroot/CVZ/llullaillaco/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Volcan Llullaillaco</a> is Mars on Earth — or about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29557533" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">as close to it as you can get</a>. At 22,000 feet above sea level, it’s the second highest active volcano on Earth. Most of the mountain is a barren, red landscape of volcanic rock and dust, with thin, dry air, intense sunlight and winds that will blow your tent down the mountain.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the ground can heat up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit, air temperatures rarely reach above freezing. When snow falls, it turns to gas just as it hits the earth. Occasionally, snow can collect in windblown banks, which then melt into icy spires up to 16 feet tall. The Spaniards called these “nieves penitentes,” penitent ones, because they look like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgYEuJ5u1K0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">hooded monks doing penance</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These conditions high up on the volcano made it seem about as lifeless as Mars. But a team of researchers led by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/steven-k-schmidt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Steven K. Schmidt</a>, a microbiologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://alpinemicrobialobservatory.weebly.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">studies extreme life</a>, have discovered microbes living in and around the penitentes at 17,300 feet above sea level, about one thousand feet above the point at which vegetation stops on Volcan Llullaillaco. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The scientists’ descriptions, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230430.2019.1618115" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published recently in the journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research</a>, exemplify how life on Earth consistently pushes our expected limits — and may even offer clues to how or where life could exist in similar environments elsewhere in the solar system.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Schmidt thought the volcano might be an ideal place to study the limits of life on Earth after he heard about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://journals.equinoxpub.com/index.php/JGA/article/view/16639" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">three children unearthed there in 1999</a>. The 500-year-old mummies were perfectly preserved without embalming agents.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The mummies when buried were “huge bags of microbes,” full of water. That they hadn’t decayed suggested the conditions deep beneath the volcano’s soil were constantly too cold and dry for any life to function.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But what about closer to the surface, where environmental conditions vary?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Schmidt knew <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00248-017-1129-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">microbes had been found in the surface tephra, or volcanic soil, of the same volcano, as well as a nearby</a> one at slightly lower elevations. But little was known about the summits or penitentes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By discovering what conditions supported patches of life among this mountain’s sterile heights, perhaps he could truly understand life’s limits.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In March 2016, the team hoped to collect soil samples from the summit of Llullaillaco. But after a week’s journey from the coast to the desert, poor weather pushed them to explore the volcano’s penitente fields instead. This was not the volcano’s most extreme environment, but it was still quite harsh and far higher up than where it seemed life could persist.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When someone on the expedition serendipitously noticed red snow at the base of some penitentes, they wondered if it could be <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/science/watermelon-snow-global-warming.html?module=inline" title="">watermelon snow</a>, an algae found in other frigid environments.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists think penitentes are the result of an unusual mix of conditions, involving wind, temperature fluctuations and the sun’s ultraviolet rays. As tiny indentations in snowpacks melt, penitentes grow up. This also liberates life’s vital elixir — liquid water.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Microscopic and genetic analysis confirmed the red patches at the bottom of the penitentes were snow algae. And the scientists also found cyanobacteria, yeast and even more complex microbes in the ice and shallow tephra downhill from where penitentes melted.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We see the penitentes as an oasis in this harsh landscape,” said Dr. Schmidt, offering water and protection from the elements to wind-carried microbes that were likely dormant before the water reanimated them.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And because penitentes are also found in the Himalayas, Pamirs and Hindu Kush — as well as on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103517303688?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Pluto</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0235-0#author-information" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Europa</a> — a closer look could point the way toward discovering lively oases on other worlds too.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I am excited about this finding for its astrobiological implications,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/lr3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Lynn Rothschild</a>, an astrobiologist at Brown University who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email.</p>
