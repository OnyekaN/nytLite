<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A week after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/us/rossello-puerto-rico-governor-resigns.html?module=inline" title="">announcing his imminent resignation</a>, Gov. Ricardo A. Rosselló of Puerto Rico nominated a new secretary of state who could succeed him. Pedro R. Pierluisi faces a confirmation hearing in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Mr. Pierluisi’s path to the governor’s seat is hardly an easy one. He <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/pedro-pierluisi-puerto-rico-governor.html?module=inline" title="">faces serious opposition</a> from some lawmakers, especially in Puerto Rico’s Senate, which could block his confirmation. That would leave the next in line — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/us/puerto-rico-wanda-vasquez-governor.html?module=inline" title="">Wanda Vázquez, the secretary of justice</a> — to become governor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the vote still uncertain, here is a look at the man who could take charge of the island’s troubled government.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Pierluisi, a 60-year-old lawyer, served as secretary of justice for three years under Mr. Rosselló’s father, former Gov. Pedro J. Rosselló. He was elected to represent Puerto Rico in Congress as its nonvoting resident commissioner and served there from 2009 to 2017.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Pierluisi was re-elected after his first term even though the governor at the time, Luis G. Fortuño, who was also on the ballot for the New Progressive Party, was not. That popularity made Mr. Pierluisi, who comes from a political family, an attractive candidate for governor in 2016.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he lost the primary that year to the younger Mr. Rosselló by about 2 percentage points, or about 10,000 votes. Mr. Pierluisi then backed Mr. Rosselló, who like him is a Democrat when it comes to national politics, though Puerto Rico’s political parties do not neatly match up with those on the mainland. The New Progressive Party supports statehood for Puerto Rico.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 1994, while Mr. Pierluisi was secretary of justice, his younger brother, José Jaime Pierluisi, a 28-year-old aide to the governor, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/11/obituaries/jose-jaime-pierluisi-28-an-aide-to-puerto-rico-governor-dies.html?module=inline" title="">was fatally shot</a> in a carjacking in San Juan, the capital.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Pierluisi is seen as competent and experienced. As resident commissioner, he ensured that Puerto Rico received federal stimulus funds and was covered by the Affordable Care Act. Both were considered important achievements.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he also faces a serious potential conflict of interest: After leaving office, Mr. Pierluisi went to work for O’Neill &amp; Borges, a law firm that does external legal consulting for the federal oversight board appointed by Congress to oversee Puerto Rico’s troubled finances.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Pierluisi took a leave of absence from the firm on Tuesday. Yet any connection to the unpopular board — which is led by Mr. Pierluisi’s brother-in-law, José B. Carrión III — is problematic in the minds of some lawmakers who will decide whether to confirm him.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement accepting his nomination on Wednesday, Mr. Pierluisi cast his Washington connections as an advantage.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is also crucial to restore the trust of federal authorities and Congress, where I have earned respect,” he said, “and to re-establish a productive relationship with the oversight board, based only on what is good for Puerto Rico and facilitates the end of its mandate.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2016, The New York Times <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/us/politics/puerto-ricos-prosperous-dc-power-couple.html?module=inline" title="">found</a> that Mr. Pierluisi introduced legislation as resident commissioner that would benefit at least two Wall Street companies that had hired his wife, María Elena Carrión, to advise them. The family’s net worth rose in part thanks to Ms. Carrión’s work helping the firms find bargains on distressed financial assets in Puerto Rico.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Both Mr. Pierluisi and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/22/opinion/a-wifes-own-success.html?module=inline" title="">Ms. Carrión</a>, an experienced investment banker, said at the time that nothing he had done was intended to help her financial advisory firm, which she set up 20 days after he was elected in 2008.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Pierluisi and Ms. Carrión are now in the process of divorcing, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.metro.pr/pr/noticias/2019/07/15/los-alcaldes-del-pnp-quienes-auscultan-pedro-pierluisi.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to</a> the Puerto Rican news media.</p>
