<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BALTIMORE — Representative Elijah E. Cummings was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/elijah-cummings-baltimore.html?module=inline" title="">firmly rooted in Baltimore</a>, but for decades <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/elijah-cummings-trump-impeachment.html?module=inline" title="">his voice extended far</a> from his brick rowhouse on the city’s west side. On Friday, the legacy of his tireless advocacy brought powerful leaders from Washington and elsewhere to his city.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cummings, a Democrat who rose in prominence in recent years for his unwavering pursuit of President Trump, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/us/politics/elijah-cummings-death-illness.html?module=inline" title="">died at 68 last week</a> in the city he called home, the same one in which he was born and lived all his life.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two former presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, were among the prominent cast of politicians, mentees and relatives who spoke at his funeral on Friday morning. Others included Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Obama roused the congregation, extolling Mr. Cummings’s values and saying that the congressman had earned the title, “the honorable.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is a title we confer on all kinds of people who get elected to public office,” Mr. Obama said. “You’re supposed to introduce them as honorable. But Elijah Cummings was honorable before he was elected to office.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There’s a difference,” Mr. Obama continued, his voice rising as many in the crowd stood up and clapped. “There’s a difference if you were honorable and treated others honorably — outside the limelight, on the side of the road, in a quiet moment counseling somebody you work with.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cummings’s success validates the concept of the American dream, Mr. Obama said, and his compassion and empathy were a lesson that kindness can be a sign of strength.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There’s nothing weak about looking out for others,” Mr. Obama said. “There’s nothing weak about being honorable. You’re not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Earlier in the service, following a psalm read by Ms. Warren and a song from one of Mr. Cummings’s favorite singers, <!-- -->BeBe Winans<!-- -->, Ms. Clinton took the stage and thanked members of Mr. Cummings’s district “for sharing him with our country and the world.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Clinton said Mr. Cummings never backed down in the face of abuses of power or from “those who put party ahead of country or partisanship above truth.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But he could find common ground with anyone willing to seek it with him,” she continued. “And he liked to remind all of us that you can’t get so caught up in who you are fighting that you forget what you are fighting for.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi asked attendees how many had been mentored by Mr. Cummings, and at least a dozen raised their hands. She recalled that he had sought to mentor as many freshman representatives as he could after Democrats took control of the House in the 2018 election.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“By example, he gave people hope,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Pelosi had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-ci-dalesandro-funeral-20191023-73fcamwbjfdphghly5youcwcfm-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">spoken at another funeral</a> in Baltimore on Wednesday for her own brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III, a former mayor of the city.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Earlier in the morning, thousands of grieving Baltimoreans stood in looping lines as the sun rose outside of New Psalmist Baptist Church, which seats 4,000 people and filled up shortly before 10, with many still outside. It’s the same church where Mr. Cummings <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-cummings-bishop-20191017-645qzgwaqrgkfmmn7nvowoflxu-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">sat in the front row most Sundays</a> even after he began using a walker and wheelchair. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cummings’s body lay in an open coffin at the front of the church on Friday, his left hand resting on his right as mourners passed by and a choir sang gospel music. An usher stood nearby with a box of tissues in each hand.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Elonna Jones<!-- -->, 21, skipped her classes at the University of Maryland to attend with her mother, <!-- -->Waneta Ross<!-- -->, who nearly teared up as she contemplated Baltimore’s loss.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He believed in the beauty of everything, especially our city,” Ms. Ross said. “It’s important we’re here to honor a civil rights activist who was still around in my generation.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Jones, a volunteer coordinator for a City Council candidate, said Mr. Cummings had motivated her to pursue a role in improving her city.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“As a young, black woman in Baltimore who wants to be in politics, he inspired me,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mourning residents stood in black coats, hats and heels and sang Mr. Cummings’s praises as the police corralled the extended lines of people who woke up early to pay their respects. Above all, attendees noted, he always looked out for his city.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He never forgot who we were,” said Bernadette McDonald, who lives in West Baltimore. “He was a son of Baltimore and a man of the people.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The big names on the service’s agenda, the television cameras lined up outside and the large crowd belied the way many attendees interacted with the devoted congressman, who lived in the heart of West Baltimore and would simply give a knowing nod to those who recognized him on the street. He carried himself like anyone else when running errands or taking a walk around the block.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If you didn’t already know him, you wouldn’t know who he was,” Ms. McDonald said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cummings saw his profile rise in recent years as he consistently sparred with Mr. Trump, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/elijah-cummings-trump-impeachment.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">determinedly pursuing</a> the president, his businesses and his associates as head of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. Mr. Cummings became a leading figure in the impeachment inquiry and was said to still be joining strategy discussions with colleagues from his hospital bed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rhonda Martin<!-- -->, who works at a local high school, said Mr. Cummings had inspired the next generation of Baltimore’s leaders by speaking to students in schools around the city.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He brought a message of hope and told students that he did it, and they can do it, too,” Ms. Martin said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cummings, whose parents were former sharecroppers in South Carolina, graduated from Howard University in Washington and earned a law degree at the University of Maryland. He was first elected to Congress in <!-- -->1996<!-- --> and never faced a serious challenge over 11 successful re-election campaigns.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, Mr. Cummings’s body <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/politics/elijah-cummings-capitol.html?module=inline" title="">lay in state in the Capitol</a>, the first black lawmaker to do so, and Republicans and Democrats <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-cummings-capitol-20191024-zgxsr262tbcwbnnmkcpr7mar3y-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">praised his integrity</a> and his commitment to his constituents. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over more than two decades in Congress, Mr. Cummings championed working people, environmental reform and civil rights. He served for two years as the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and frequently spoke of his neighborhood while pushing legislation to lower drug prices, promoting labor unions and seeking more funding for affordable housing. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even in his war of words with the president, the battle made its way to Baltimore when, in July, Mr. Trump called Mr. Cummings’s district a “disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess” and appeared to make light of a break-in at Mr. Cummings’s home, during which the congressman <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/trump-elijah-cummings-house-robbed.html?module=inline" title="">scared an intruder away</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president’s insults still anger Baltimore residents. “See? We’re not all trash and rats,” one congregant said as she sat down in the church on Friday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cummings <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/28/us/trump-baltimore.html?module=inline" title="">responded to the president by saying</a> it was his “moral duty” to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/politics/trump-baltimore.html?module=inline" title="">fight for residents in his district</a>. “Each morning, I wake up,” he wrote, “and I go and fight for my neighbors.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Jennifer Cummings, one of Mr. Cummings’s two daughters, recalled early morning calls from her father on her birthdays and the ice cream they shared in Baltimore’s Inner Harbor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Reading from a letter to her father, Ms. Cummings said her father had taught her to “love my blackness” by insisting on buying her dolls with brown skin and telling her to appreciate her lips and nose.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While she was proud of all the titles he held over his life, “perhaps the most important title you held in your 68 years on e<!-- -->arth <!-- -->was dad,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of Mr. Cummings’s brothers, James Cummings, said that in one of their last conversations, the congressman spoke of his heartbreak <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/investigations/bs-md-sun-investigates-cummings-nephew-20190315-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">over the unsolved killing</a> of James’s 20-year-old son, Christopher Cummings, in Norfolk, Va., in 2011.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The killing “haunted Elijah for the rest of his life,” James said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Adia Cummings, the congressman’s other daughter, said Mr. Cummings always challenged her and her sister to be better people. And even though he would nudge her about owing him money, he rarely turned down her requests, even recently making sure that she could attend a concert for the rapper Cardi B.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He didn’t really know who she was, but he went out of his way, even from his sick bed, to make sure I could go see her,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, Mr. Cummings’s wife and the chairwoman of the Maryland Democratic Party, gave a fiery speech that brought multiple rounds of applause and many congregants to their feet more than once. And while she did not cite President Trump by name, she invoked him clearly, saying her husband’s work had become “infinitely more difficult” in the last few months of his life because of “sustained personal attacks” on him and his city. “It hurt him,” Ms. Cummings said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Looking at Mr. Obama, she recalled that Mr. Cummings had stood with the former president early and proudly. “But you didn’t have any challenges like we have going on now,” she added with a smile, as Mr. Obama nodded and responded with an appreciative chuckle. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Cummings said she felt as if people were trying to tear Mr. Cummings down, and that the celebrations and outpouring of love this week had assured her that he was sent off with the respect he deserved.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two days before Mr. Cummings died, his wife said, the staff at the Johns Hopkins Hospital had wheeled him up to the roof to see the sun and look over the city he never left.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Boy, have I come a long way,” he said, according to Ms. Cummings.</p>
