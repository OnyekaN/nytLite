<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As our devices get smaller and more sophisticated, so do the materials we use to make them. That means <!-- -->we have to get up close <!-- -->to engineer new materials. Really close.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Different microscopy techniques allow scientists to see the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/science/microscopes-cell-biology-dna.html?module=inline" title="">nucleotide-by-nucleotide genetic sequences</a> in cells down to the resolution of a couple atoms as seen in an atomic force microscopy image. But <!-- -->scientists at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., and the Institute for Basic Sciences in Seoul, have taken imaging a step further, developing a new magnetic resonance imaging technique that provides unprecedented detail, right down to the individual atoms of a sample.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The technique relies on the same basic physics behind the M.R.I. scans that are done in hospitals.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When doctors want to detect tumors, measure brain function or visualize the structure of joints, they employ huge M.R.I. machines, which apply a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/well/live/do-mri-scans-cause-any-harm.html?module=inline" title="">magnetic field across the human body</a>. This temporarily disrupts the protons spinning in the nucleus of every atom in every cell. A subsequent, brief pulse of radio-frequency energy causes the protons to spin perpendicular to the pulse. Afterward, the protons return to their normal state, releasing energy that can be measured by sensors and made into an image.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But to gather enough diagnostic data, traditional hospital M.R.I.s must scan billions and billions of protons in a person’s body, said Christopher Lutz, a physicist at IBM. So he and his colleagues <!-- -->decided to pack the power of an M.R.I. machine<!-- --> into the tip of another specialized instrument known as a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE2yE8SvHmA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">scanning tunneling microscope</a> to see if they could image individual atoms.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The tip of a scanning tunneling microscope is just a few atoms wide. And it moves along the surface of a sample, it picks up details about the size and conformation of molecules.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The researchers attached magnetized iron atoms to the tip, effectively combining scanning-tunneling microscope and M.R.I. technologies.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When the magnetized tip swept over a metal wafer of iron and titanium, it applied a magnetic field to the sample, disrupting the electrons (rather than the protons, as a typical M.R.I. would) within each atom. Then the researchers quickly turned a radio-frequency pulse on and off, so that the electrons would emit energy that could be visualized. The results were described Monday in the journal <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0573-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Nature Physics</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s a really magnificent combination of imaging technologies,” said A. Duke Shereen, director of the M.R.I. Core Facility at the Advanced Science Research Center in New York. “Medical M.R.I.s can do great characterization of samples, but not at this small scale.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The atomic M.R.I. provides subångström-level resolution, meaning it can distinguish neighboring atoms from one another, as well as reveal which types of atoms are visible based on their magnetic interactions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is the ultimate way to miniaturization,” Dr. Lutz said. He hopes the new technology could one day be used to design atomic-scale methods of storing information, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/technology/quantum-computing-research.html?module=inline" title="">for quantum computers</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Current transistors are <!-- -->still nearly one hundred atoms wide<!-- --> and need to switch on and off to store a single bit of information in a computer.he ability to corral individual atoms could drastically increase computing power and enable researchers to tackle complex calculations such as predicting weather patterns or diagnosing illnesses with artificial intelligence.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Moving an atom from one location to another in a composite could also change and lead to the development of new ones. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The technique might also help scientists <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://qz.com/1400391/a-new-approach-in-the-hunt-for-alzheimers-drugs-stops-malformed-proteins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">study how proteins fold</a> and develop new drugs that bind to specific curves in a biological structure.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We can now see something that we couldn’t see before,” Dr. Lutz said. “So our imagination can go to a whole bunch of new ideas that we can test out with this technology.”</p>
