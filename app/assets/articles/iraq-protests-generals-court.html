<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BAGHDAD — A dozen senior military and police commanders in Iraq will be removed from their posts and will face prosecution on accusations of allowing their troops to shoot demonstrators at <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/world/middleeast/iraq-protests-corruption.html?module=inline" title="">mass protests this month</a> without an order from the prime minister’s office, the government announced on Tuesday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/05/world/middleeast/iraq-protest.html?module=inline" title="">five days of protests</a> in the first week of October, at least 149 civilians were killed and 4,207 others wounded, an official report found. The report also said that eight members of the security forces had been killed and 1,287 others wounded. The overwhelming majority of the protesters were unarmed. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The punitive action taken by Adel Abdul Mahdi, Iraq’s prime minister, was the sharpest rebuke of military excess at any time in recent years, and its language was strikingly clear and strong. It nevertheless drew broad criticism from Iraqis across the political spectrum, mixed in with some praise. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The sharpest words came from those disappointed that the government had failed both to take responsibility for its part in the bloodshed and to hold to account the popular mobilization units, some backed by Iran, known as Hasht al-Shabi. Security units linked to the groups were believed to be responsible for some of the most deadly excesses. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> “The report was distinguished for being the first time a governmental committee reached a result — usually they procrastinate and make the whole thing fade away with time,” said Majid al-Waali, a member of the largest bloc in Parliament, which is loyal to nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. al-Waali, however, noted the limits of the findings.<br/></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> “The report,” he said, “did not point out the government’s responsibility for the bloodshed. In total the government disavowed responsibility and instead accused officers and personnel who were in direct contact with the demonstrators.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Mahdi acted on the basis of a 46-page official report he received on Monday. Among its findings: The military and the police used “excessive force”; there was a “loss of command and control” by the generals and security leadership on the ground; and, in at least one place, snipers appeared to be shooting at protesters. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not all the injuries were caused by government forces, according to the report. Some of the protesters threw Molotov cocktails that wounded both other protesters and security personnel, it said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And in the confusion and chaos of the streets, ambulances had difficulty making their way through the crowds. Some of those wounded died because they did not reach a hospital in time, according to the report. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The security forces called on to keep order, the report said, lacked the training needed to handle mass protests. And it confirmed reports that, in some cases, local officials had encouraged troops to fire on protesters, noting that there were recordings of the permission being given. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most of the protesters were men age 15 to 25. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The report did not address the question of which military units appeared to be using snipers to target the protesters. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, <!-- -->the United Nations human rights division in Iraq issued its own report on the demonstrations. It said its investigators had received “multiple credible and consistent reports indicating that unarmed demonstrators were targeted deliberately by individuals positioned on roofs and in vacant buildings.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Iraqi government’s investigators said privately that they believed that some of the gunfire believed to have been come from snipers had actually come from soldiers and police officers frightened by the crowds of protesters and randomly opening fire.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their report largely glossed over the role that fighters for Hasht al-Shabi are believed to have played in vandalizing four television stations, some of which was caught by security cameras and circulated widely on social media. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rather than naming the group, the report said that members of “armed groups” had been responsible. It said that “some of those responsible have been arrested and released with sponsors” while they await trial. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The report named just five people in connection with the attacks on the broadcasters. Video footage obtained by The New York Times showed as many as 25 heavily armed men entering one of the offices, that of Al Arabiya, and smashing computers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The government said, ‘We arrested some of the armed group who attacked the media channels and we released them,’” said Ali al-Bayati, a member of the Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights, who was designated to participate in the investigative committee’s work. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We want to understand why they released them,” he said. “Who were they? To whom are they affiliated? And how did they release them when these people had violated the constitutional right to freedom of speech?”. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Overall, the report is “disappointing.” Mr. al-Bayati said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At least four senior military officers whose operations were in Baghdad were among those referred for prosecution. And the police commanders of at least six provinces south of Baghdad where protesters were shot, including <!-- -->Babil, Dhi Qar, Muthanna, Najaf, Qadisiya<!-- --> and Wasit, lost their jobs. Intelligence chiefs whose officers were working close to areas where there were snipers or forces shooting at protesters will also be referred to the court. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among the most striking aspects of the report was that those being referred to the court and those being removed from their jobs were named, publicly shamed them for their failings — a rarity in Iraq. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The report was the work of a special investigative committee appointed by Mr. Mahdi that included representatives from the Defense, Interior and Planning Ministries, as well as from the Supreme Judiciary Council and the Iraqi High Commission on Human Rights, among others. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Mahdi and his supporters apparently hope to prove to the demonstrators — and to the many more Iraqis who did not demonstrate but who agreed with those who did — that the government has the ability to hold accountable those in its own ranks who violate orders or who flout the authority of the state.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They also want to signal that they have heard protesters’ accusations that there is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/world/middleeast/iraq-corruption-protests.html?module=inline" title="">corruption at the highest levels of the government</a> and that powerful people within it behave with impunity. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Whether the moves, along with proposals to hire thousands of young people and create low-cost housing opportunities, will be enough is not yet clear. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More demonstrations have been called for Friday. </p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Falih Hassan contributed reporting.</p>
