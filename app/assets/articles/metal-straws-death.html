<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A British woman was impaled by a metal straw after falling at her home, a coroner said in an <!-- -->inquest<!-- --> this week that highlighted the potential dangers of metal straws. Such straws have surged in popularity as cities, states and even countries have banned single-use plastic straws.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The woman, Elena Struthers-Gardner, 60, who had a disability, fell and sustained a traumatic brain injury in November when the 10-inch straw pierced her eye, according to the coroner’s report, which was released on Monday. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> “As a consequence of the fall, a stainless steel straw that was in a glass Kilner-style cup Mrs. Struthers-Gardner was carrying penetrated her left eye,” the report said, referring to a glass jar similar to a Mason jar that often has a lid. It called her death an accident.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The report, released in Bournemouth, about two hours southwest of London, said that she fell at her home on Nov. 22, and was taken to Southampton General Hospital, where she died the next day.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Struthers-Gardner’s wife, Mandy, said in a statement read at the inquest that her partner had been a former jockey and was prone to falls after a horseback riding injury when she was 21. She had scoliosis — a curvature of the spine — and had dealt with substance abuse issues, her wife said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Struthers-Gardner’s wife did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A British straw ban will go into effect in April, but the worldwide environmental push against single-use straws has encountered opposition from some caregivers and advocates for people with disabilities. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/07/11/627773979/why-people-with-disabilities-want-bans-on-plastic-straws-to-be-more-flexible" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">They have voiced worries</a> about the safety of rigid straws and the overall availability of straws for people who are unable to drink without them. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Clearly great care should be taken when using these metal straws,” said Brendan Allen, an assistant coroner, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/17756360.retired-jockey-died-fell-metal-drinking-straw/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to The Bournemouth Daily Echo</a>. “There is no give in them at all.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It seems to me these metal straws should not be used with any form of lid that holds them in place,” he added. “It seems the main problem here is if the lid hadn’t been in place, the straw would have moved away.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kim Sauder, a Toronto-based blogger and Ph.D. student in disability studies, said that Ms. Struthers-Gardner’s death was a cautionary tale. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I don’t know if the ‘reusable straw,’ as the environmentally minded person conceives of them, are actually common enough yet to really know what dangers they pose,” Ms. Sauder said Wednesday. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“A straw ban is nothing but environmental theater,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/crippledscholar/status/1021809110289932289" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Ms. Sauder tweeted last year</a>. “The greatest accomplishment of the straw ban is genuinely the bigotry it has emboldened against disabled people.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many people with disabilities rely on straws to drink, Ms. Sauder said, but could have difficulties finding them in states and <!-- -->cities<!-- -->, such as California and Seattle, that have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/03/climate/plastic-straw-bans.html?module=inline" title="">banned or restricted single-use straws</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Starbucks <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/business/starbucks-plastic-straws.html?module=inline" title="">plans to eliminate</a> its ubiquitous green plastic straws at 28,000 of its locations around the world in 2020. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s not easy being green for Starbucks, however. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2016, the coffee chain <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/starbucks-recalls-2-5-million-metal-straws-after-reports-mouth-n622161" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">recalled stainless steel straws</a> sold at its shops because they posed an injury risk. At the time, Starbucks said it had received reports of three children in the United States and one in Canada who had been lacerated by the straws, which were sold with reusable beverage containers. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dentists say that improper use of metal or glass straws can also be bad for teeth. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Clearly, chewing on a metal or glass straw can be hazardous to your teeth and your health,” said Dr. Timothy Chase of SmilesNY Cosmetic and Implant Dentistry in New York. “Just like we tell people not to chew on pens.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Chase added that it’s important to keep reusable straws clean to avoid infection-causing bacteria. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Christina Trapani, the owner of Eco Maniac Company, which sells reusable straws, called Ms. Struthers-Gardner’s accident “horrible.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s an unfortunate example,” Ms. Trapani said. “Hopefully it won’t impact the movement.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her company, which is based in Virginia Beach, sells steel, paper, glass, bamboo and silicone reusable straws. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Metal straws are, hands down, the most popular,” said Ms. Trapani, who started her company in 2008. “I’m sure that there will be some concern, especially with children and people with disabilities.” She said that flexible silicone straws were a practical alternative.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Americans use 170 million to 390 million straws a day, according to estimates from market research firms. (A widely cited statistic places the number higher, at 500 million, but that estimate <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/business/plastic-straws-ban-fact-check-nyt.html?module=inline" title="">is based on the research of a 9-year-old boy</a>.) </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those numbers, along with a viral video of a marine biologist <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://time.com/5339037/turtle-video-plastic-straw-ban/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">removing a plastic straw</a> from a sea turtle’s nose in 2015, have influenced policymakers.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Christine Hauser contributed reporting. </em></p>
