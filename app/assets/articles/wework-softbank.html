<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WeWork said it was going to transform the market for office space, reinvent the way people work and elevate the world’s consciousness. But in recent weeks, the brutal reality beneath the lofty visions has emerged.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After failing to go public, the company was running out of money fast and needed a bailout. On Tuesday, WeWork’s largest outside investor, SoftBank, provided a last-ditch lifeline — a multibillion-dollar rescue package that would enable it to wrest control from Adam Neumann, WeWork’s co-founder and former chief executive, three people with knowledge of the matter said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even though Mr. Neumann’s hypergrowth strategy drove WeWork into the ground, he could walk away with a billion dollars while giving up special voting rights and stepping down from the board.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s a messy, costly end to an audacious corporate experiment — one that attempted to turn the old business of subletting office space into a cutting edge technology play. WeWork’s descent highlights the dangers of throwing money at inexperienced chief executives who say they can upend long-established industries.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now, SoftBank, which had already invested around $10 billion in WeWork, could find itself investing in a money pit. The company’s core business — leasing space, refurbishing it and renting it out to its “members” — is not profitable and may not be for the foreseeable future. SoftBank intends to install one of its own top managers, Marcelo Claure, who is also executive chairman of Sprint, as executive chairman of WeWork.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Employees at WeWork are bracing for layoffs and real estate experts say the company will have to significantly scale back its growth plans and possibly even give up some of the space it has leased in recent months for lack of paying customers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SoftBank’s takeover values WeWork at just $7 billion, down from the $47 billion that SoftBank reckoned it was worth in January, these people said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Just a few weeks earlier, WeWork had been planning to sell shares to stock investors in what its investment banks had billed as one of the biggest initial public offerings in recent years. But that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/30/business/wework-ipo.html?module=inline" title="">share sale</a> was scrapped last month after Wall Street investors balked at the company’s huge losses and unusual corporate governance structure.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WeWork’s board chose the SoftBank deal over a $5 billion debt financing offer from JPMorgan Chase.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The SoftBank deal will mean a possible huge payout for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/business/dealbook/wework-ceo-adam-neumann.html?module=inline" title="">Adam Neumann</a>, WeWork’s co-founder who stepped down as chief executive last month, under pressure from shareholders — including SoftBank — who grew skeptical of his leadership as the I.P.O. started falling apart.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Neumann will receive a three-year loan of about $425 million to repay a credit line from JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and UBS that is secured by his shares in WeWork, which have dropped significantly in value.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like other WeWork shareholders, Mr. Neumann will be able to sell shares to SoftBank but must use at least $100 million of the proceeds to pay down his loan, the people said. Mr. Neumann owns about 30 percent of the company and could sell up to $1 billion in shares to SoftBank. Once the deal is complete, SoftBank will own about 80 percent of WeWork.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Neumann will also give up special shares that have 10 votes each,back the deal, leave the WeWork board and become a consultant to SoftBank for four years, these people said. SoftBank will pay him $185 million for his advice, and Mr. Neumann will be barred from starting another company or poaching employees from WeWork.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition, SoftBank will loan WeWork $5 billion at the same interest rate that SoftBank typically pays its lenders, these people said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Given how much it has already invested in WeWork, Softbank’s takeover will only be successful if WeWork is eventually sold or goes public at a valuation of $15 billion or more, these people said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WeWork is not the only <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/business/softbank-wework-masayoshi-son.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email&amp;module=inline" title="">SoftBank-backed company</a> to run into trouble. SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son, and its $100 billion Vision Fund have also poured money into Uber and Slack, whose stock prices tumbled after they started trading on the stock market several months ago.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A WeWork spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-take-control-of-wework-11571746483?mod=hp_lead_pos1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Wall Street Journal</a> previously reported some of the terms of the WeWork-SoftBank deal.</p>
