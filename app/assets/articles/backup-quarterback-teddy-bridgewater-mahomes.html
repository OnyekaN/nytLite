<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s a hard fact of the N.F.L. that quarterbacks get hurt. And that means teams that may have looked like Super Bowl contenders on paper are suddenly sending out Joe Ordinary to take snaps. In other places, offensive saviors have fallen short of franchise expectations and been swapped out for well-traveled arms.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several teams <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/sports/football/jets-quarterbacks.html?module=inline" title="">have made quarterback changes</a> this season, both voluntarily and involuntarily, with drastically different results. Here’s a look at how those backups have done. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was taking over for a legend, Drew Brees, but Bridgewater has been up to the task, reeling off five consecutive wins. He has nine touchdowns against two interceptions, and with the team two and a half games clear of Carolina in the N.F.C. South, Saints fans have little to complain about. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His best game statistically was a four-touchdown, 314-yard effort against the Buccaneers in Week 5, but he gave a disciplined effort in a comfortable win on Sunday in Chicago without Alvin Kamara to hand off to. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Brees is hoping to return from thumb surgery sooner rather than later, but Bridgewater’s performances have at least given his recovery some breathing room.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After Cam Newton sprained his foot in Week 2, the Panthers turned to Allen, their second-year man. He did well in two appearances last year and has created more buzz this season, throwing seven touchdowns in four wins without being intercepted. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Newton will regain the starting job when he returns, perhaps in a few weeks, but Allen is at least making it a debate, something few would have expected when the season started. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a tall order to replace Andrew Luck, who <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/sports/football/andrew-luck-retirement-injuries.html?module=inline" title="">shockingly announced his retirement</a> in August, just two weeks before the start of the regular season. But Brissett has been explosive, with 14 touchdowns, one off the league lead, against three interceptions, a clear improvement over his 13 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2017, when he subbed for an injured Luck. He was exceptional on Sunday, with four touchdown passes, to beat the Texans and take a half-game lead in the A.F.C. South on a day when the team’s running game stalled. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In midgame last week, the Titans sent Marcus Mariota to the bench and turned to the veteran Tannehill, who was most recently a starter with the Dolphins last season. The move has looked inspired so far: Tannehill was 13 of 16 against the Broncos last week and 23 of 29 in a start against the Chargers on Sunday. He has played only a game and a half, but his adjusted yards per pass figure is 9.0, trailing only Patrick Mahomes, Kirk Cousins and Russell Wilson this season. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Jaguars acquired Nick Foles in the off-season, only to see him go down with a broken collarbone in Week 1. That put the team in the hands of Minshew, a little-known rookie who was drafted in the sixth round. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With 10 touchdowns in seven games, two interceptions and an 8.0 adjusted yards per pass figure, Minshew has been more than acceptable. And his mustache and dress sense have made him a cult hero.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Foles is about ready to come back to practice and can play again on Nov. 17 when he comes off injured reserve. It says something about Minshew’s play that there is debate over which quarterback gives the team the better shot to win. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rudolph took over the team when <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/sports/football/ben-roethlisberger-drew-brees-injury.html?module=inline" title="">Ben Roethlisberger was lost for the season</a> in Week 2. He was workmanlike, but no Big Ben.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then he, too, got hurt. His replacement, Devlin Hodges (1-0), had a good completion rate in his one start, but now that Rudolph is out of concussion protocol, he will get another chance next Monday against the Dolphins, a cushy spot for a return.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He filled in when Mitchell Trubisky was hurt and was a combined 44 of 60 with three touchdowns and two interceptions when substituting in against Minnesota and starting versus Oakland. Bears fans weren’t high on Trubisky before, but they welcomed him back readily this week.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not much of a sample size. Moore was 10 of 19 on Thursday against Denver after Patrick Mahomes went down during the game with a dislocated knee. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Moore has been around the N.F.L. since 2007, picking up the odd start here and there. His longest string as a starter came in 2011 with the Dolphins, when he managed a 6-6 record with a pretty poor team. Still, he has only five career starts since then. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now that Mahomes is out for an indefinite period, we will find out what the 35-year-old Moore has left, starting with a game against the Packers on Sunday night. Quarterback Kyle Shurmur, son of Giants Coach Pat Shurmur, is expected to be promoted from the Chiefs’ practice squad.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Giants fans who have embraced the rookie, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/sports/eli-manning-giants-daniel-jones.html?module=inline" title="">stepping in for a benched Eli Manning</a>, may dispute this rating. But Jones has seven interceptions against six touchdowns and a poor 5.4 adjusted yards per attempt figure. The promise is there, but after three consecutive losses, the same Giants fans who booed him when he was drafted may be ready to turn on him again. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Dolphins have been switching between Rosen and the opening-day starter, Ryan Fitzpatrick, with dizzying speed. Neither one has been good, but it would defy the ghost of Red Grange for either quarterback to succeed with the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/sports/football/redskins-dolphins.html?module=inline" title="">motley collection of talent in Miami.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sam Darnold got mono, then Trevor Siemian got hurt, making Luke Falk the unlikely starter. He had a decent debut, then was terrible in two starts, going 27 of 48 with three interceptions and no touchdowns. To the relief of Jets fans, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/sports/football/sam-darnold-return-jets.html?module=inline" title="">Darnold is now back under center.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now in his sixth year in D.C., and a favorite of Coach Jay Gruden, McCoy was called to sub for the starter Case Keenum for a Week 5 game. The move was a puzzling one, given that the rookie Dwayne Haskins, the supposed future of the franchise, was available.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unfortunately for McCoy, his shot came against the Patriots. He was 18 of 27 for 122 yards with an interception. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/07/sports/jay-gruden-redskins.html?module=inline" title="">Gruden was fired</a>, and McCoy returned to the bench. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">McCoy wound up with an adjusted yards per passing figure of 2.9, the lowest in the league for a quarterback with 20 or more passes.</p>
