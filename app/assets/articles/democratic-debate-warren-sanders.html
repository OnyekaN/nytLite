Most analysts expect confrontation, because these are the last debates before the standards for qualifying<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>get tougher.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Those candidates below the top tier will likely feel an urgency to stand out tonight and tomorrow — and to get the kind of attention that leads to donations and rising poll support.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here’s what I’ll be looking for tonight:</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Whom are Sanders and Warren pitching?</strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>The highest-profile candidates in this debate are Senators <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/opinion/bernie-sanders-president-2020.html" title="">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/opinion/sunday/elizabeth-warren-president-2020.html" title="">Elizabeth Warren</a>, and they are obviously competing for many of the same supporters. They’re also both virtually guaranteed to make the next debate. <!-- -->So I’m more interested in their overall approach than in any conflict between them. </p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Both have organized their campaigns around <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/opinion/democrats-economics.html" title="">a populist pocketbook message</a> that is well-suited to win swing voters who supported Donald Trump in 2016 (and then swung back to the Democratic column <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/opinion/democrats-2020-trump-2018-midterms.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fdavid-leonhardt&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">in 2018</a>). Those swing voters — like the American public as a whole — tend to be very progressive on taxes and other economic issues, favoring higher taxes on the rich and corporations, a higher minimum wage and expanded government health care.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">But I’ve been disappointed to see both Sanders and Warren go further this year and emphasize positions that most Americans don’t favor, like the forced elimination of private health insurance. Their message on immigration has also become less balanced than Sanders’s message once was, with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/opinion/immigration-trump-racism.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fdavid-leonhardt&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=10&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">virtually no discussion</a> of border security.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Tonight, I’ll be watching to see whether Warren and Sanders are more focused on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/08/upshot/democratic-electorate-twitter-real-life.html" title="">Twitter Democrats</a> or actual Democratic voters. Both senators became national voices by paying more attention to the latter.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The center lane.</strong> Many Democratic voters see themselves as moderates. They aren’t especially ideological and, more than anything, they want to beat President Trump in 2020.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">The fact that there are so many of these voters — roughly half of the Democratic primary electorate, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/245813/leans-conservative-liberals-keep-recent-gains.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Gallup</a> — means there should be a place for a candidate who chides other Democrats for moving too far left on Medicare, immigration, free college and other issues.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Tonight’s debate lineup, which was chosen randomly, happens to include most of the candidates who could play this centrist role: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; Governor Steve Bullock of Montana; John Hickenlooper, the former Colorado governor; John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman; and Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">I’m especially curious to see whether either Klobuchar or Bullock — who have the résumés and skills to be top-tier candidates — can have a big moment.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">What’s </strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/opinion/the-argument-mayor-pete-buttigieg.html" title="">Mayor Pete</a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">’s plan?</strong> He is currently at the bottom of the top tier of candidates. One option is for him to keep doing what he’s been <!-- -->doing<!-- --> and put his hopes on slowly building support, especially in Iowa. Another option is to take on Sanders or Warren.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">I expect he will avoid big risks tonight, but maybe not; debates are fascinating in part because of the uncertainty.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Is Beto done? </strong>No 2020 candidate has been more disappointing than <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/opinion/beto-orourke-senate-democrats-2020.html" title="">Beto O’Rourke</a>. He looked like a top candidate when the campaign began. But his rollout was weak — too much glitz, not enough substance — and he has sometimes seemed halting on the trail. “Mr. O’Rourke has looked like what he is: a novice,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/opinion/beto-2020-democratic-debate.html" title="">Mimi Swartz</a> writes in a new Times Op-Ed. “Candidates to the left and the right of him have more experience, more knowledge and more ideas.”</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Presidential campaigns are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/opinion/elizabeth-warren-2020-electability.html" title="">longer than media pundits often suggest</a>.
