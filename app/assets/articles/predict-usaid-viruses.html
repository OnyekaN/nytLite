The surveillance project is closing because of “the ascension of <!-- -->risk-averse<!-- --> bureaucrats,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because USAID’s chief mission is economic aid, he added, some federal officials felt uncomfortable funding cutting-edge science like tracking exotic pathogens.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Congress, along with the administrations of George W.

That’s expensive."</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The United States spent $5 billion fighting Ebola in West Africa,” he added. “This costs far less.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The goal of Predict <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ohi.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/programs-projects/predict-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">was to speed up and organize the previously haphazard hunt</a> for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cdc.gov/onehealth/basics/zoonotic-diseases.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">zoonotic diseases</a> — those that may jump from animals to humans. In recent years, scientists have discovered many lethal viruses lurking in wild and domestic animals. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It has long been known, of course, that AIDS originated in chimpanzees and probably was first contracted by bushmeat hunters. Ebola circulates in bats and apes, while SARS was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/05/world/china-to-kill-10000-civet-cats-in-effort-to-eradicate-sars.html?module=inline" title="">found in captive civet cats</a> in China. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In South Asia, Nipah virus <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/15/science/killer-virus-is-linked-to-asian-flying-foxes.html?module=inline" title="">reaches humans through pigs</a> or <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/health/22global.html?module=inline" title="">date palm sap</a> infected by bats carrying the virus.

The virus can jump from human to human, especially in hospitals.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Novel influenza viruses <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2749972/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">originate in migratory ducks and geese</a>. The viruses spread <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/health/a-flu-epidemic-that-threatens-birds-not-humans.html?module=inline" title="">first to domestic poultry flocks</a>, then to pigs and humans. Mutations picked up along that viral highway can render the viruses far more dangerous.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These discoveries led to new ways of preventing spillovers of infections into human populations: closing markets where wildlife is butchered for food,; putting bamboo skirts on sap-collection jars to keep bats out; or penning pigs and camels in places where they cannot eat fruit that bats have gnawed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Predict teams have investigated mysterious disease outbreaks in many countries, including a die-off of 3,000 wild birds in a Mongolian lake. One team proved that endangered otters in a Cambodian zoo were killed by their feed — raw chickens infected with bird flu.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A Predict laboratory helped identify bat-borne viruses that a boys’ soccer team might have been exposed to while trapped for weeks in a cave in Thailand.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Allowing Predict to end “is really unfortunate, and the opposite of what we’d like to see happening,” said Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former prime minister of Norway and former World Health Organization director-general. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She was co-chair of a panel that in September issued <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/experts-detail-global-pandemic-readiness-gaps-offer-steps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a report detailing the world’s failure to prepare for pandemics</a>. “Americans need to understand how much their health security depends on that of other countries, often countries that have no capacity to do this themselves,” Dr. Brundtland said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even though USAID is “incredibly proud and happy over the work Predict has done,” the program is closing because it reached the end of a 10-year funding cycle, said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/organization/irene-koek" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Irene Koek</a>, acting assistant administrator of the agency’s global health bureau.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We typically do programs in five-year cycles, and it had two,” she said. Some similar research will be part of future budget requests, “but it’s still in the design-and-procurement cycle, so exactly what will continue is a bit of a black box.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In mid-October, the agency said it would spend $85 million over the next five years helping universities in Africa and Asia teach the “one-health” approach that Predict used. (“One health” describes the nexus between animal, human and environmental medicine). </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But it will not involve the daring fieldwork that Predict specialized in.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among the institutions that worked on Predict projects are those staffed by wildlife veterinarians and disease-trackers like the University of California, Davis’s One Health Institute; the EcoHealth Alliance; the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wcs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Wildlife Conservation Society</a>, <!-- -->which runs the Bronx Zoo; the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.si.edu/museums/national-zoo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Smithsonian Institution</a>, which manages the National Zoo in Washington<!-- -->; and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/research/center-infection-and-immunity/combating-pandemic-threats" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Columbia University’s Center for Infection and Immunity</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some Predict projects will be taken over by other government agencies, such as the Pentagon’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.dtra.mil/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Defense Threat Reduction Agency</a> or the National Institutes of Health. But those agencies have different missions, such as basic research or troop protection. They do not share USAID’s goal of training poor countries to do the work themselves.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As an agency that gives money to countries, USAID often has a friendlier, more cooperative relationship with governments in poor nations than, for example, Pentagon-led efforts might.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’ve always been impressed with the way they were able to work with ministries of health,” said Dr. James M. Hughes, a former chief of infectious diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was on Predict’s advisory board. “They have a high level of trust, and they help countries comply with the International Health Regulations.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">(Those regulations, in force since 2007, require countries to report all major disease outbreaks to the World Health Organization and allow the W.H.O. to declare health emergencies.) </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">USAID still supports some health-related programs like the President’s Malaria Initiative and the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. But Dr. Carroll described those as “cookbook portfolios.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">How to fight those diseases is well-known, he explained, so the agency just comes up with a budget for drugs, diagnostic kits, insecticides, mosquito nets, condoms or other long-established interventions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Predict more often placed medical detectives in the field, training local doctors, veterinarians, wildlife rangers and others to collect samples from wild and domestic animals.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It can be highly specialized work. Getting blood samples from pigs or wild rodents is fairly routine, but catching <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsclippings/archives/2005/nov05/110605.htm#Sentries%20in%20U.S.%20Seek%20Early%20Signs%20of%20the%20Avian%20Flu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">birds</a>, bats or monkeys alive is not. Gorillas <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/health/ebola-gorillas.html?module=inline" title="">are harder</a>. (Scientists usually content themselves with just <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/28/health/28malaria.html?module=inline" title="">collecting gorilla feces</a>.) </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Predict also experimented with novel ways to catch and release animals unharmed, to transport samples without refrigeration and to use DNA testing that can scan for whole viral families instead of just known viruses, said <!-- -->Dr. <!-- -->Christine Kreuder Johnson, associate director of the One Health Institute at the University of California, Davis.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Predict sponsored epidemiological modeling to predict where outbreaks are likely to erupt. It also sought ways to curb practices, such as hunting for bushmeat or breeding racing camels, that encourage eruptions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After that West African Ebola outbreak, Predict researchers determined exactly <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/health/ebola-bat-liberia-epidemic.html?module=inline" title="">which bat species carried the Ebola Zaire strain that caused it</a>. Another team in Sierra Leone <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/27/ebola-virus-discovery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">discovered a new strain of the virus</a>, now known as Ebola Bombali.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Zaire strain was found in a bat that roosts in caves and mines, said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/personnel/dr-jonathan-epstein" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Dr. Jonathan Epstein</a>, an EcoHealth Alliance veterinarian, while the Bombali type was in a species that roosts in houses. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Distinctions like that are important for telling people — especially people who eat bats — which species are dangerous.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> “We generated an illustrated book on how to keep bats out of houses by putting screens on windows or mesh below the roof thatch,” he said. “That’s the kind of thing Predict paid for.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Predict served as a proof of concept for a much more ambitious idea that Dr. Carroll proposed several years ago: the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.globalviromeproject.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Global Virome Project</a>, which envisioned trying to compile a genetic atlas of all the viruses circulating in all animals. By some estimates, there are more than 800,000 such viruses waiting to be discovered. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many scientists<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(19)30335-3/fulltext" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> questioned the wisdom of spending as much as would be needed to do that — over $3 billion</a>. But those experts also argued that Predict, which is focused on viruses dangerous to humans, was very much worth the relatively modest amounts of money it cost.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Predict needed to go on for 20 years, not 10,” Dr. Epstein said. “We were getting to the point of having a trained work force that could gather animal samples and labs that could test for unknown viruses, not just known ones.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Once it stops, it’s going to be hard to maintain that level of proficiency.”</p>
