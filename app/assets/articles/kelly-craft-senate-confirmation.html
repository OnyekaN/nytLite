<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kelly Knight Craft, <!-- -->the United States ambassador to Canada<!-- -->, was confirmed on Wednesday to serve as the next ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More than five months after President Trump announced Ms. Craft as his nominee for the post, the Senate approved the appointment in a 56-to-34 vote largely along party lines, with only five Democrats deciding in her favor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The post is widely considered the second-most important foreign policy position in a presidential administration, after the secretary of state. But Ms. Craft is stepping into the job at a time of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/world/united-nations-united-states-trump-isolationism.html?module=inline" title="">widespread doubts</a> about the Trump White House’s commitment to global institutions like the United Nations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During Ms. Craft’s confirmation hearing last month, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said she was a “phenomenal selection by the president.” But Democrats took issue with Ms. Craft’s relative lack of diplomatic experience as well as her family’s investments in fossil fuels. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the hearing, Ms. Craft said she would “assume this position with cleareyed humility,” adding that she had “much to learn about the United Nations.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/world/americas/un-kelly-knight-craft-nomination.html?module=inline" title="">differentiated herself from Mr. Trump</a> by saying that Saudi Arabia must be held accountable for human rights abuses and that humans have contributed to climate change.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Craft, 57, became the United States ambassador to Canada in 2017. During her tenure, the relationship between Canada and the United States was strained by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/world/canada/trudeau-trump-nafta.html?module=inline" title="">bitter trade negotiations</a>, during which Mr. Trump accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of “making false statements” and being “very dishonest and weak.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although she kept a relatively low profile during her tenure as ambassador to Canada, Ms. Craft was criticized for statements she made about the environment during an October 2017 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://youtu.be/2UFtm33dLB8?t=97" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">interview</a> with CBC News. Asked whether she believed in climate change, Ms. Craft said that she respected “both sides of the science,” despite the overwhelming scientific consensus on global warming.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But during her confirmation hearing, she said that “human behavior has contributed to the changing climate.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Let there be no doubt,” she added. “I take this matter seriously, and if confirmed, I will be an advocate for all countries to do their part in addressing climate change.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Craft, a Kentucky native, has been known as a fund-raiser for Republican candidates and officeholders. She is close to Mr. McConnell, who is also from Kentucky. Ms. Craft and her husband, Joseph W. Craft III, a billionaire coal magnate, donated more than $2 million to Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and inauguration.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Craft has some experience at the United Nations, having served as an alternate delegate to the body under President George W. Bush, who appointed her in 2007.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SFRC%20Minority%20Report%20--%20Nomination%20of%20Kelly%20Craft.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">minority report</a> from the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations this month, her critics said she was a poor candidate because she had displayed a “lack of depth on key foreign policy issues” during her hearing, and because she was often “away from the embassy — and indeed, outside the country” while ambassador to Canada.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her elevation to the 193-member United Nations will fill a significant vacancy in the Trump administration’s diplomatic corps. Ms. Craft’s predecessor, Nikki R. Haley, announced in October that she was resigning from the post at the end of last year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The post was filled temporarily by Jonathan R. Cohen, who had served as deputy representative to the United Nations during Ms. Haley’s tenure.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In December, President Trump was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/us/politics/heather-nauert-united-nations.html?module=inline" title="">planning to nominate Heather Nauert</a>, a former Fox News anchor who was then the chief State Department spokeswoman, for the high-profile ambassadorship. But she <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/16/us/politics/heather-nauert-withdraws-un-ambassador.html?module=inline" title="">withdrew from consideration</a> in February, citing family concerns. People familiar with the process said she dropped from the running because she had a nanny who did not have the proper work visa.</p>
