<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stop-motion animation has been around <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.thewrap.com/a-timeline-of-stop-motion-animation-history-from-a-trip-to-the-moon-to-isle-of-dogs-photos/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">since the 1800s</a> and still flourishes in the works of studios like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.aardman.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Aardman Animations</a>, the force behind <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wallaceandgromit.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“Wallace &amp; Gromit”</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stSYs7a2UHE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">other creations</a>. With stop motion, you make an inanimate object “move” by snapping a photo and then stopping to subtly adjust the object’s position before taking the next shot. When enough photos of these gradual movements are captured, you run them together as a video that shows the object seeming to propel itself.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Creating a stop-motion clip can be a great way to jazz up a presentation, dabble in moviemaking basics or keep the children busy with a time-consuming project. All you need is something to animate — paper cutouts, Lego figures or other toys, for example — along with a camera, the right app and patience. Here’s how to get rolling.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To get started, decide on which app you’d like to use. If you plan on using your smartphone camera, there are many options. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cateater.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Stop Motion Studio Pro</a> for Android, iOS, Mac and Windows ($2 to $10 depending on the system) is a popular option. It has a huge collection of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cateater.com/support.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">editing features</a>, including a tool to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cateater.com/help/stopmotion-android/en/#add-facial-expresions-to-lego-figures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">add facial expressions to Lego people</a>. A free version, Stop Motion Studio, is available for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cateater.stopmotionstudio&amp;hl=en_US" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Android</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stop-motion-studio/id441651297#?platform=iphone" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">iOS</a>, but it does not offer as many audio and visual effects, or the ability to record higher-resolution video, unless you pay through in-app purchases.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Alternative apps include <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://picpac.tv" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">PicPac</a> for Android and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://fingerlab.net/portfolio/imotion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">iMotion</a> for iOS (both free, with in-app purchases) and the child-friendly <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kudlian.net/products/icananimatev2/home.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">I Can Animate</a> for Android, iOS, Mac and Windows (a free “lite” edition and pay versions starting around $3). But again, some features cost extra, like the ability to drop in a new background if you <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/technology/personaltech/make-green-screen-video.html?module=inline" title="">record in front of a blue or green screen</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For those who prefer working on a computer, other programs, like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.dragonframe.com/dragonframe-software/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Dragonframe</a> for Windows, Mac and Linux (around $300 for the full version) and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ikitmovie.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">iKITMovie</a> for Windows (prices start at $69), are available, each with free trial versions. <!-- -->Just keep in mind that with those programs, you will need to move your photos from a camera to the computer, instead of doing it all on your smartphone or tablet.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stop-motion animation takes time and effort, so you unless you’re just messing around, you might want to sketch out your scenes before you begin. If a cheap notebook and pencil seem too rustic, plenty of digital tools can help you visualize your future film, including storyboard and drawing apps, or even a stylus-friendly free <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/technology/personaltech/collecting-your-thoughts-is-good-organizing-them-is-even-better.html?module=inline" title="">notes app</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As you plan your movie, consider some basic questions: Who are your characters, and how will they move? What is the course of the action? Do you have proper lighting and the right background for your scene? </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If you need inspiration, you can find the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/storyboard-examples-film" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">storyboards of famous films</a> to study with a quick web search.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The objects you’re animating are the only things that should be moving in your stop-motion production. Keeping the camera steady is essential. A small tabletop tripod for your camera or smartphone can cost as little as $5 online and also keeps your hands free.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Depending on the app and device you’re using, you may be able to snap the shutter remotely, which minimizes the potential for accidentally knocking the camera around. A Bluetooth remote (like the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://camkix.com/products/camkix-wireless-camera-shutter-remote-control-for-smartphones-create-amazing-photos-and-selfies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">$8 CamKix remote</a> for smartphones) is one option. Gear you may already have — like an Apple Watch or the volume buttons on corded iPhone earbuds — might also trip the shutter in some apps.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When you have your camera, background and lighting set, start animating. Take a photo, then carefully adjust the object you’re using, and then take the next picture. For passably smooth action, you generally need to take 10 to 12 photos for each second of finished video.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some apps like Stop Motion Studio Pro include an on-screen grid for positioning and an “onion skin” layer that shows the placement between frames so you can better gauge how far to move the figure in the next shot. Keep taking photos until you have captured all the movement you need for your scene.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If your stop-motion app includes a suite of multimedia effects and editing functions, you can fine-tune the final version of your masterpiece right there. If your chosen app doesn’t offer such bells and whistles, export your stop-motion clips and import them into a regular <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/technology/personaltech/how-to-make-mini-vacation-movie.html?module=inline" title="">video-editing tool</a> like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">iMovie</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kinemaster.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Kinemaster</a> or Microsoft’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/photo-movie-editor" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Photos app for Windows 10</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once<!-- --> you’ve edited scenes, added music, titles (and most importantly, the credits), export your production and share it with friends, family and the internet. And if you had fun, start planning your sequel.</p>
