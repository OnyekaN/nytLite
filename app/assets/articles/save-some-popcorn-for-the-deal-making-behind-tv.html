<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Edmund Lee, a media reporter, discussed the tech he’s using.</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">What tech tools do you rely on most for reporting on the media industry?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">My iPhone is my everyweapon. It’s for emails, texts, Signals, interviews, notes, even suggestions for the best subway route. (I swear by Citymapper, which my wife recommended.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">My typical use case goes something like this: I’ll be headed to a news conference when a source Signals, saying he’s in town. I’ll check my calendar and text back a possible time as I hunt through OpenTable for a reservation somewhere convenient. After I find a spot, I’ll send a calendar invite. By then, I’m exiting the subway and Slacking my editor about when I’ll be back in the office.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like most reporters, I’m incredibly impatient. Smartphones are the best (or worst?) enablers for that kind of pathology.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’ve also filed stories from my phone. In May, I was occupied at a news conference when the Walt Disney Company announced it was buying control of Hulu. My laptop was dead, and all the outlets in the room were taken. I tapped out <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/business/media/disney-hulu-comcast.html?module=inline" title="">almost the entire article</a> from the compose window of my email app.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Also, I hate to say it, but Twitter.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Twitter, really?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Really. I’m not being cheeky. You have to go where the sources are, and when it comes to media, a lot of them are on Twitter. A lot. I follow the usual suspects, but I also make myself known.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last year, I interviewed the AT&amp;T executive who was put in charge of WarnerMedia, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/edmundlee/status/1007727005905883138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in my tweet promoting the piece</a>, I highlighted a comment he made about the importance of culture fit between the two companies. A source direct-messaged me in disbelief. We chatted, and that led to a story about <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/media/hbo-att-merger.html?module=inline" title="">a closed-door town hall at HBO</a> that exposed some of those culture differences. It got a lot of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F07%2F08%2Fbusiness%2Fmedia%2Fhbo-att-merger.html&amp;src=typd&amp;module=inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">attention</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And, yes, my <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/edmundlee" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">DMs are open</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But my best tool is the in-person meeting. I think that’s true for most reporters. Sources want to make sure they can trust you. And a lot can be revealed with just a look. A look can tell you <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/business/media/buzzfeed-jonah-peretti-mergers.html?module=inline" title="">where to hunt</a> for a particular story. So the restaurant, the bar, the coffee shop are important tools. I go out a lot.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Clothes are a device, too. Not to stick out but to blend in. A close-cut suit and cordovan lace-ups when appropriate. The look changes if it’s someone in Hollywood or Palo Alto, but you get the idea.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">What do you personally use to consume media?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’m the opposite of a cord cutter. I’ve had the same cable account for nearly 20 years. I also have most of the streaming services: Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon Prime, CBS All Access and even PBS, which offers a $5-a-month app.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’ll toggle from the Yankees game on my cable feed to the Netflix app on my Roku box to binge “Derry Girls” (it’s great) while scrolling through Twitter on my phone.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And for media geeks like me, HBO’s “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/business/media/hbo-succession-business.html?module=inline" title="">Succession</a>” is everything. The second season really shines. I have a few quibbles, but I’m amazed by its <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/04/business/media/hbo-succession-business.html?module=inline" title="">vivid accuracy</a>. Plus, witness Sunday Night Twitter, when broadcasting your favorite lines becomes its own piece of theater.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">How has streaming changed the media industry?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Streaming is both a reaction to and a cause of cord cutting, but really it just means more content. It’s worth noting that for all of tech’s disruptions, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/business/media/apple-content-hollywood.html?module=inline" title="">Apple</a> and Amazon are now in the business of producing what is essentially cable television. Google and Facebook, too. You have to wonder when one of them will just buy a media company.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’m not saying it’ll happen, but <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/business/cbs-viacom-merger.html?module=inline" title="">there</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/business/dealbook/sprint-tmobile-merger.html?module=inline" title="">were</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/business/media/disney-fox-merger-vote.html?module=inline" title="">nearly</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/business/dealbook/att-time-warner-ruling-antitrust-case.html?module=inline" title="">$200 billion</a> in history-making <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/07/27/business/media/mergers-streaming.html?module=inline" title="">media mergers</a> in the past year. All the big ones are done. The next one — if there is to be one — will be a tech giant swallowing a media giant. The irony is that media merged to take on tech, but it’s one possible outcome.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I’ll add one more note: Robert A. Iger, the head of Disney, published a book in September that reads as a sort of business memoir. In it, he writes that he believes if Steve Jobs were still alive, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/09/bob-iger-remembers-steve-jobs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Apple would most likely have bought Disney</a>. That’s fascinating. Saying it out loud isn’t what makes it interesting. Saying it out loud more than a year after Disney <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/business/media/disney-fox-merger-vote.html?module=inline" title="">agreed to buy the majority</a> of Rupert Murdoch’s media empire for $71.3 billion is what makes it interesting.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Is social media a blessing or a curse?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I guess social media somehow felt inevitable? It reminds me of the 1980s TV series “Max Headroom.” The log line went something like this: In the future, an all-powerful TV network controls society through subliminal programming. Sound familiar?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The premise was more fanciful than the current reality, but the show presciently dramatized the disinformation campaigns we’re now witnessing across social media, except the social media companies are also the unwitting tools. (I suspect Netflix or HBO or Amazon may want to revive the show.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Semi-seriously, is there anything outside of work? </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But seriously, our household has the usual stuff. We have an Alexa that my wife can’t stand. I use it as a timer and to check when our packages are coming. We have several Philips Hue smart bulbs that are a nifty way to set up the lights. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">My coffee grinder is my most consistently prized nonwork gadget. It’s a Baratza Encore and it’s not cheap, but I have to have good coffee. It’s the only way I can resolve myself in the morning.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And our teenage daughter is an expert at piping Spotify through our Sonos speakers as she flips through her Instagram while swiping through Netflix on our iPad to find something to watch. I have no idea where she gets it from.</p>
