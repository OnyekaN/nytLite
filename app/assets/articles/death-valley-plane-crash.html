<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fighter jets on training missions drop into a narrow canyon in California’s Death Valley National Park, banking and dodging the jagged walls. On a nearby overlook, tourists and aviation enthusiasts crane their necks or aim cameras at the jets, some of them so close that onlookers can glimpse into cockpits.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This is a typical day at the so-called “Star Wars” Canyon, where the high-tech spectacle of American military jets resembles the famous sequence at the end of “Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope,” in which spaceships plunge and speed through a corridor on the Death Star. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But on Wednesday, a Navy F/A-18E Super Hornet crashed near the canyon, killing the pilot, military officials said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Seven people on the ground were injured, none of them seriously, said Patrick Taylor, a National Park Service spokesman. The Navy said it would not release the pilot’s name until his next of kin had been notified. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The plane went down just before 10 a.m. about 40 miles north of Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, the Navy said, and it left a dark scorch mark seared onto the volcanic cinder surface of the valley. The cause of the crash had not yet been determined.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Park rangers responded to the scene after they received reports of smoke. The people who were injured told them they had been hit by <!-- -->fragments<!-- --> from the crash <!-- -->and<!-- --> had cuts or burns, Mr. Taylor said. They were taken to nearby medical facilities and treated, he said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The people who were hurt were part of a tour group from France, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://abc30.com/navy-f-a-18e-fighter-jet-crashes-in-inyo-county/5433048/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the news station ABC7 reported</a>. One of them, his leg bandaged, told the news channel that the plane had crashed about 160 feet in front of their group, which had been standing at the Father Crowley vista point overlooking the valley.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The station did not show the people’s faces as it interviewed them. “We were just a little bit behind, and the plane came like this,” said a woman, her arm wrapped in gauze, making a sweeping gesture that suggested a curving turn by the plane.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The canyon, officially called Rainbow Canyon, is one of the best-known places in the world to watch sophisticated military aircraft and their pilots as they train, and draws visitors from around the country and the world. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mike Holbrook, 58, a retired military contractor, often meets up with like-minded visitors who gather at a popular spot overlooking the canyon with cameras or folding chairs to gawk in wonder when the jets suddenly pop into view.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is actually really close,” he said, referring to the proximity of the planes. “Planes come in and dip into the canyon. You feel the rumbling, especially when they kick in the afterburners. You can feel it in your chest.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rainbow Canyon, about 160 miles north of Los Angeles, is described by the National Park Service as a landscape of “dark lava flows and volcanic cinders that abruptly gives way to the deep chasm.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The canyon and the surrounding area have been used by the American military for low-level flight training since the 1930s, Mr. Taylor said. When Rainbow Canyon officially became part of Death Valley National Park in 1994, an agreement called for that practice to continue, with an agreement for flights to remain at least 200 feet above the ground, he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Taylor said that he did not know exactly when the area began to be called Star Wars Canyon, but that the origin of the <!-- -->name<!-- --> might also be a nod to the canyon’s geological resemblance to Luke Skywalker’s home planet, Tatooine. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The training flights often tear through the canyon, but they are unscheduled and unpredictable. “It is regular enough that there are people who do go there to watch the planes coming, but not so common that everybody who sits there sees them,” Mr. Taylor said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added that he had spoken to some enthusiasts who have seen “a couple dozen” flights in an outing, while others have stayed for hours with no luck.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The canyon itself is an unforgiving place, especially in the summer months when it is brutally hot,” Ben Ramsay, who runs an aviation website and is based in Britain, wrote in an email. He posted video online of his visit to the canyon <!-- -->last month<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I can say that the skills that I observed of these talented airmen and women are second to none,” he said. “The flying that I witnessed in the canyon in early July was highly skillful, and it has come a real shock to me and to the wider aviation community of this terrible incident.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The crash was rare, officials said. “We have had mishaps before, in various locations, but not in this particular location,” said Capt. Jim Bates, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://abc30.com/navy-f-a-18e-fighter-jet-crashes-in-inyo-county/5433048/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to a televised news broadcast.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The jet was part of a fighter squadron called VFA-151, which is stationed in Lemoore, Calif., and attached to the aircraft carrier John C. Stennis. It is a twin-engine warplane designed to fly from either aircraft carriers or ground bases.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tom Demerly <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://theaviationist.com/2017/11/17/is-star-wars-canyon-americas-plane-spotting-jewel-at-risk-of-overuse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">wrote in 2017 on the website The Aviationist</a> that Rainbow Canyon was “the Mt. Everest and the Louvre” of plane spotting. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s “one of the few places on earth where you point your camera down to shoot combat aircraft photos.”</p>
