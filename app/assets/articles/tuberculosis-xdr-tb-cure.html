<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">TSAKANE, South Africa — When <!-- -->she<!-- --> joined a trial of new tuberculosis drugs, the dying young woman weighed just 57 pounds.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Stricken with a deadly strain of the disease, she was mortally terrified. Local nurses told her the Johannesburg hospital to which she must be transferred was very far away — and infested with vervet monkeys.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I cried the whole way in the ambulance,” Tsholofelo Msimango recalled recently. “They said I would live with monkeys and the sisters there were not nice and the food was bad and there was no way I would come back. They told my parents to fix the insurance because I would die.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Five years later, Ms. Msimango, 25, is now tuberculosis-free. She is healthy at 103 pounds, and has a young son.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The trial she joined was small — it enrolled only 109 patients — but experts are calling the preliminary results groundbreaking. The drug regimen tested on Ms. Msimango has shown a 90 percent success rate against a deadly plague, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration effectively endorsed the approach, approving the newest of the three drugs used in the regimen. Usually, the World Health Organization adopts approvals made by the F.D.A. or its European counterpart, meaning the treatment could soon come into use worldwide.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tuberculosis<!-- --> has now<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/10/28/WHO-Tuberculosis-passes-HIV-as-leading-global-cause-of-death/7391446056825/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> surpassed AIDS as the world’s leading infectious cause of death</a>, and the so-called XDR strain is the ultimate in lethality. <!-- -->It is <!-- -->resistant to all four families of antibiotics typically used to fight the disease. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only a tiny fraction of the 10 million people infected by TB each year get this type, but very few of them survive it. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/52/4/1801350.full.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">about 30,000 cases</a> in over 100 countries. Three-quarters of those patients die before they even receive a diagnosis, experts believe, and among those who get typical treatment, the cure rate is only 34 percent.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The treatment itself is extraordinarily difficult. A typical regimen in South Africa requires up to 40 daily pills, taken for up to two years. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other countries rely on even older regimens that include daily injections of antibiotics that can have devastating side effects, including deafness, kidney failure and psychosis.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in the trial Ms. Msimango joined, nicknamed Nix-TB, patients took only five pills a day for six months. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The pills contain just three drugs: pretomanid, bedaquiline and linezolid. (Someday, the whole regimen might come in just one pill, as H.I.V. drugs do, one expert said.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Until recently, some advocacy groups opposed pretomanid’s approval, saying the drug needed further testing. But other TB experts argued that the situation is so desperate that risks had to be taken. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://medicine.yale.edu/intmed/people/gerald_friedland.profile" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Gerald Friedland</a>, one of the discoverers of XDR-TB and now an emeritus professor at Yale’s medical school, called Nix “a wonderful trial” that could revolutionize treatment: “If this works as well as it seems to, we need to do this now.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">News that tuberculosis had <!-- -->evolved<!-- --> a terrifying new strain <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/18/world/africa/18aids.html?module=inline" title="">first broke in 2006</a>, when doctors at a global AIDS conference learned of a doomed group of tuberculosis patients in Tugela Ferry, a rural South African town. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Of the 53 patients in whom the strain had been detected, 52 were dead — most within a month of diagnosis. They were relatively young: The median age was 35. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many of them had never been treated for TB before, meaning they had caught the drug-resistant strain from others who had been infected and had not developed it by failing to take their drugs. Several were health workers who were assumed to have caught it from patients.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Within months, South Africa realized it had cases of the deadly infection in 40 hospitals. Alarmed, W.H.O. officials called for worldwide testing. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The results showed that 28 countries, including the United States, had the deadly strain, XDR-TB, and that two-thirds of the cases were in China, India and Russia. It took far longer to determine how widespread it was in Africa, because most countries there could not do the sophisticated testing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, helped drive the epidemic. Anyone infected with it is 25 times as likely to get TB, according to the W.H.O. But many victims, including Ms. Msimango, catch this type of TB without ever having H.I.V.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the early years, XDR-TB <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/world/africa/25safrica.html?module=inline" title="">was a death sentence</a>. Doctors tried every drug they could think of, from those used to treat leprosy to those for urinary tract infections. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“From 2007 to 2014, we threw the kitchen sink at it,’’ said Dr. Francesca Conradie, a researcher at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, and director of the Nix trial.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The death rate was about 80 percent. Sometimes the drugs killed patients. In other cases, patients died of the disease, because they could not tolerate the drugs and stopped taking them. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tuberculosis germs burrow deep into the lungs and barricade themselves inside clumps of dead cells. Breaking those nodules apart and killing all the bacteria inside requires taking drugs for months.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nearly all antibiotics cause nausea and diarrhea. But some, especially the injections, are far tougher on patients.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Some get hallucinations,” said Dr. Pauline Howell, a tuberculosis researcher who runs the Nix trial <!-- -->at Sizwe<!-- --> Tropical Diseases Hospital in Johannesburg, where Ms. Msimango was treated. “I had one patient who tried to cut open his skin because he thought bugs were crawling under it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The drugs may leave patients in wheelchairs with vertigo, or deaf in just a weekend. Nerves in their feet and hands may wither until they can no longer walk or cook. One of Dr. Howell’s patients suffered so much from ringing in the ears that he tried to commit suicide.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Msimango, too, veered close to death because the drugs were too much for her.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When she was 19, she said, she caught drug-resistant TB from another young woman — the temporarily homeless daughter of a friend of her mother.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her mother had generously taken in the young woman and had told her daughter to share her bed, a common arrangement in townships like Tsakane. “A few weeks after she left, I started coughing,” Ms. Msimango said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“She had not told us that she had drug-resistant TB and had defaulted,” she added, using a common term for dropping out of treatment.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At first, Ms. Msimango got her injections at a hospital and took her pills under her mother’s watchful eye. But they made her feel so awful that she secretly spat them out, stuffing them between the sofa cushions when her mother wasn’t looking.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After she defaulted twice herself, she was transferred to Sizwe, terrified that she would die alone.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although it lies in South Africa’s largest city, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://northeasterntribune.co.za/155176/monkeying-around/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Sizwe does host monkeys</a>, <!-- -->along with feral peacocks and the occasional mongoose. <!-- -->It has long been on the front lines of South Africa’s protracted battle against tuberculosis. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The hospital sits on an isolated hilltop 10 miles from downtown. The British built it in 1895 as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.theheritageportal.co.za/article/grave-story-rietfontein-sizwe-hospital" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Rietfontein Hospital</a> to house victims of contagious diseases like leprosy, smallpox and syphilis.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/controversy-in-south-africa-over-hospital-with-gandhi-link/articleshow/40082397.cms?from=mdr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Gandhi volunteered there</a> during a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.indianspice.co.za/2014/08/gandhis-1904-plague-site-set-to-be-destroyed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">1904 bubonic plague outbreak</a>, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.biography.com/political-figure/desmond-tutu" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">was a tuberculosis patient</a> there in his youth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 1996, with the AIDS epidemic raging, the W.H.O. announced that South Africa <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/26/world/surprising-many-tb-is-found-to-be-rampant-in-south-africa.html?module=inline" title="">had the world’s worst tuberculosis epidemic</a>: 350 cases per 100,000 citizens.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That finding shocked the government, which had been using outdated approaches against the disease. Diagnoses were made by X-ray, which are less accurate than sputum tests, and doctors hospitalized every patient.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I visited shortly after the 1996 announcement, and the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/13/world/south-africa-slow-to-battle-spread-of-tuberculosis.html?module=inline" title="">situation inside Rietfontein was unnerving</a>. In the men’s ward, dozens of TB patients lay on cots only two feet apart; those with drug-resistant strains slept next to patients with the usual type. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">No one wore a mask, and no doctor was on duty. At night, the patients shut the windows and turned up the heat, and the room became a deadly incubator.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A return visit this month showed that far more than the name had changed (Sizwe <!-- -->means<!-- --> “nation” in Zulu).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The former men’s ward is now a mostly empty meeting hall. Patients with TB that is not drug-resistant are treated at home, and even those with partially drug-resistant strains are usually hospitalized only briefly.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The XDR-TB patients rest in a ward atop the hill, and golf carts transport those too weak to walk. Each patient has a separate room and bathroom, hookups for oxygen and lung suction, a TV and big windows and a door to the lawn outside.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The building has a sophisticated ventilation system, but it often breaks down, so the policy is to keep all the doors and windows open as much as possible, said Dr. Rianna Louw, the hospital’s chief executive.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Patients can work in the garden, play pool or foosball, and take classes in sewing, beading or other crafts that might help them earn a living when they get out.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the months of isolation needed for treatment can be tough. “Our children are scattered, they are falling apart!” a <!-- -->patient<!-- --> who gave her name only as Samantha shouted at a group-therapy session that turned into an airing of grievances. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The father of my kids is in prison,” she said. “My firstborn son is arrested for robbing people in the street. That would not happen if I was home!”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The counselor interrupted to say: “We understand your frustration. But if we discharge you, we are taking a risk. You are not healthy. You can still expose people to your disease. That’s why you will stay a minimum of four months.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The regimen successfully tested at Sizwe is called BPaL, <!-- -->shorthand for the three drugs it <!-- -->comprises: bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The BPaL regimen is “bold, because it’s three killer drugs instead of two killers plus some supportive ones,” Dr. Howell said<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most regimens, she explained, rely on two harsh drugs that can destroy bacterial walls and include others that have fewer side effects but only stop TB bacteria from multiplying.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But even the new treatment poses hazards.<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Short-term use of linezolid against severe hospital infections causes few problems, but use for many weeks against TB can kill nerves in the feet, making it hard to walk, or can suppress the bone marrow where blood cells are made. (To find the ideal linezolid dose, the Nix investigators have started a new trial, ZeNix.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The F.D.A. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/business/fda-approves-new-tuberculosis-drug.html?module=inline" title="">approved bedaquiline in 2012 for use against multi-drug resistant TB</a> (the XDR strain is an even deadlier subset), and in 2015 the W.H.O. followed suit. Until Wednesday, pretomanid was in dispute, although in June an F.D.A. advisory <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.tballiance.org/news/fda-advisory-committee-votes-favorably-question-effectiveness-and-safety-pretomanid-combination" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">committee voted 14 to 4 to approve</a> it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some advocacy groups argued at the time that the drug had been too little tested. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Pretomanid looks like a promising drug, but it’s being rushed forward, and we don’t want to see the F.D.A. lower the bar for approval,” Lindsay McKenna, co-director of the tuberculosis project at the Treatment Action Group, an advocacy organization, said in July.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her organization and others had asked the F.D.A. to first demand more rigorous testing of the drug. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pretomanid is not owned by a drug company but by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.tballiance.org/about/mission" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the TB Alliance</a>, a nonprofit based in New York that is seeking new treatments.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Mel Spigelman, the alliance’s president, had argued that a full clinical trial would be both impractical and unethical.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Put yourself in a patient’s position,” he said. “Offered a choice between three drugs with a 90 percent cure rate, and 20 or more with less chance of cure — who <!-- -->would consent to randomization?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Such a trial would cost $30 million and take five more years, he added: “That’s a very poor use of scarce resources.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Innocent Makamu, 32, was facing two years in the hospital when he chose to join the Nix trial in 2017.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like Ms. Msimango, he also had caught drug-resistant TB from a roommate. A plumber, he had shared a room at a distant construction site with a carpenter.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He was too much on the bottle,” Mr. Makamu said. “He kept defaulting.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Soon afterward, he began feeling tired and lost his appetite. Doctors at the hospital near his home diagnosed tuberculosis, and put him on 29 daily pills and a daily injection.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was deep in my bum,” he said. “I couldn’t sit properly. It hurt every day.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the hospital, he watched two other inpatients wither and die because they could not stick to the regimen. “I thought, ‘Oh, there is no survival here.’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then further tests showed that he had full-blown XDR-TB. He was transferred to Sizwe and offered a spot in the Nix trial.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some patients there who were on the standard 40-pill regimens discouraged him. “They said, ‘They are using you as guinea pigs,’” he said. “Even the nurses thought that.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he found the possibility of taking only five pills for six months very tempting, and so he volunteered. Within a month, he could tell it was working.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Then the patients who called us ‘guinea pigs’ — they wished they had taken the research pills,” he said.</p>
