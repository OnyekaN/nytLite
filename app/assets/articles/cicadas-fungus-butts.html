<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beneath the soil, <!-- -->cicada<!-- -->s wait — as long as 17 years — until the right temperature beckons them to the surface. At once, they emerge, like zombies rising from graves. They greet the sun, preparing to molt into adults in coming weeks and then fly off to mate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Such is a cicada’s simple life — unless it’s been infected.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Massospora, a parasitic fungus, has lurked just below the surface, awaiting the cicada’s exit. When a nymph digs through infected soil, fungal spores cling to its body. As the cicada matures, massospora multiplies, digesting the insect’s insides, castrating it and replacing its rear end with a chalky white plug of spores.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The cicada buzzes on, seemingly unaware it’s a mushroom’s moving minion. It flies, attempting to mate with unusual vigor. Some males even mimic females to attract and spread their spores to male partners — the more infected, the better. And as their hijacked bodies copulate, spores sprinkle to the earth and massospora spreads.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This really has all the elements of a sci-fi horror story,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.davis.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/directory/matthew-kasson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Matthew Kasson</a>, a mycologist at West Virginia University, said. “How does an organism function even though two-thirds of their body is no longer theirs?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Perhaps, he thinks, the fungus dopes it with psychoactive drugs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As reported last year in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/375105v1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a paper that had not yet been through peer review </a>and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/massospora-parasite-drugs-its-hosts/566324/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in the Atlantic</a>, Dr. Kasson and colleagues discovered the infected cicadas’ plugs were laced with an amphetamine called cathinone, found only in the khat plant of the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and psilocybin, the hallucinogen that makes magic mushrooms magic.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the time, his team assumed massospora synthesized these drugs on its own, following the same recipes in khat and magic mushrooms. But a follow-up genomic analysis, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1754504819300352" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published recently in Fungal Ecology</a>, revealed massospora didn’t have the right ingredients. Its drug lab had evolved independently. It also shows that for prospectors seeking pharmaceutical advances in nature, there are more drugs to be found in unexpected places.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We think of most fungi as having fruiting bodies that rise from the soil like umbrellas. But massospora has none. To transport its spores, it uses the cicada’s living body, which spreads the fungus as it mates, like an STD.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But how does the fungus get the cicada to ignore the damage to its body and carry on mating?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Kasson and his team collected cicadas and measured the mass of their spore plugs, comparing it with known chemicals.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He was shocked to find psilocybin and cathinone, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.drugs.com/article/csa-schedule-1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">both schedule 1 drugs</a>, and even informed the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, which allowed the team to continue.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These drugs, used recreationally as mind-alterers or stimulants, are also appetite suppressants. Psilocybin <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367557/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">eases depression and anxiety in cancer patients</a>, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-7091-1501-5_8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cathinone in ADHD medications improves</a> concentration. Dr. Kasson suspected they might act similarly on cicadas.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It turned out that infected annual cicadas, which rise each year, were under the influence of psilocybin, while infected periodical cicadas, which emerge after more than a decade, were drugged with cathinone. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And the cicadas infected when emerging from their dirt naps had significantly higher amounts of narcotics in their plugs than the less-active cicadas they infected as adults while copulating. The drug-fueled focus on mating could maximize the critical spore dispersal of those cicadas infected as nymphs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The team had found the drugs. But they wondered what made them.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When they <!-- -->sequenced the genomes of massospora fungi species that infect cicadas<!-- -->, they expected to find the genes used by magic mushrooms or khat to produce the narcotic substances. But those genes were missing. One possible explanation is that the fungus and cicada, maybe including the microbes living in its gut, co-evolved a unique interaction to produce these substances.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But what would the cicada get out of it?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Kasson can only speculate. Maybe drugs make cicadas less desirable to predators. Maybe they make cicadas fearless. “Maybe the cicadas just want to feel numb,” he said.</p>
