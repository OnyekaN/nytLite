<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">ALBI, France — I was late, oh so late, and my car’s GPS had expired in the midst of remote vineyards and stands of cypress and golden fields of humanoid-looking sunflowers. So this American hurtled down medieval farm roads making wrong turns after wrong turns until, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">miracle sacre</em>, I suddenly found myself at Hotel La Réserve, a handsome country hotel with manicured grounds and a glittering swimming pool. Attractive, if anxious-looking, young men and women parted, and at their center, sitting on a white couch, was poor Thibaut Pinot, the great hope to capture this tour for France.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He wore a 1,000-yard stare.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tragedy had befallen him a day earlier. The Tour de France peloton, the amoeba-like mass of more than 100 cyclists who ride fast and hip-to-hip, had come to one of the ubiquitous roundabouts when Pinot and his team made a split-second decision to go left instead of right.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That exposed all to cutting crosswinds. He fell dozens of seconds off the pace, and that might as well have been two hours.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pinot could not bring himself to say much at that news conference. So his manager, Marc Madiot, who had a great mane of white hair and a defiant jut to his chin, commanded the couch like a captain on his poop deck. As my French consists of a bouillabaisse of nouns and verbs, and conjugations that too rarely align, I understood little other than his many recitations of “jamais,” as in never give up, never surrender, never.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Afterward I sidled up to him and asked to have a few words in English. Madiot studied me wreathed in a truly fine sneer and said: “En Francais! Seulement!” In French, only.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I was hungry and tired and feared my inner New Yorker coming on, seulement. Our country has enough diplomatic problems in Europe these days. I nodded and returned to those medieval roads.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So it goes in the Tour de France, the grandest of the world’s cycling races, a 2,162-mile pell-mell journey from the cobbled streets of Belgium across much fought-over Alsace-Lorraine to the scorching hills of the Côte d’Azur to the thoroughly humbling climbs of 5,000 and 6,000 feet in the Pyrenees and Alps and finally three weeks on down the Champs-Élysées in Paris.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I had parachuted in when the race was seven days on, which is like nosing your canoe into Class IV rapids. I caught up with the cyclists as they cut across the Massif Central, an austere region of extinct volcanoes and lonely forests and white-tailed hawks soaring above chalky gorges.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I found my way to Lacalm, a 185-person hamlet that sits at 3,694 feet, the highest point of the race this day. I had traveled remote roads, country lanes where you had to eye oncoming drivers and decide which of you would roll onto the grass to let the other pass.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As my belief in reincarnation is less than firm, I deferred.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Downtown Lacalm had a few dozen medieval homes, a shop or four and old bikes decorated merrily with paper carnations. A wrought-iron crucifix with a writhing alabaster Jesus loomed over the town.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Up the road, we heard a great roar — un rugissement! — and I craned my neck looking for riders. None. Instead, it was the carnival that traveled across France with the riders, a collection of caterwauling, beeping knockoffs of Thanksgiving Day floats, sponsored by fried chicken and optical chains, sausage brands and an amusement park and Disney. Men road stationary bikes atop these wobbling floats, and helpers sat in the cabs and tossed key chains and sun visors and candy at the feet of spectators. I got winged by a tchotchke advertising a medical service.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The race this day stretched 136 miles and came to an end in Albi, a handsome medieval city on the Tarn River. A horde of cyclists sprinted in after 5 p.m., down a shaded avenue of shedding plane trees, the crowds six, seven deep, waving flags, loosening whistles and raising glasses of wine and beer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Earlier, this same Pinot had made his fateful decision to go left rather than right, and he was disconsolate as he rolled to a stop, enfolded by sweaty television crews.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two of his team’s soigneurs (caretakers) sprinted over with a bottle of water and a towel, trying to wipe him down. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What, reporters asked in four languages at once, happened out there?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pinot shrugged and began to peddle away. “What do you want me to say?” he said, before adding that it had been a lousy day, using a profanity for “lousy.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is these vagaries, the unexpected roundabout, the too merry man waving a wine glass midroad, the great green umbrella that was upended by the wind on an earlier day and landed in the middle of the peloton like Mary Poppins on LSD, that make this race so maddening and dangerous and, yes, enjoyable. There is also the ever-present and always unspoken shadow of doping, a generational elixir for cyclists that just might be a touch rarer today.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Early the next morning, I wandered over to the CCC Pro Team’s bus. I fell into conversation with Jim Ochowicz, who manages the team and is a veteran of many biking wars. He spoke of France, where the passion for cycling edges into religious passion.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is the Super Bowl,” he said, but with a difference. Football fields are 100 yards with every detail controlled and manicured to the manic-obsessive inch.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Our venue is every road in France, and each year the route is different,” he said. “If they are doing road work, if there is a pothole, you have a split second to deal with it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A bit of math: Over the 3,481 kilometers of the 2019 Tour, there are 3,576 obstacles: 404 roundabouts, 308 sections that narrow precipitously, 28 hairpin turns and 334 speed bumps, not to mention rail crossings and drunks.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As we spoke, cyclists glided effortlessly in and out of the crowds, like so many serene goldfish in a bowl. Imperceptibly, at first, a tension built, and I said goodbye and moved with a herd of reporters down the road, following the bikes. Bands played, townspeople waved and the peloton began to move out of Albi, the temperatures already in the mid-80s and the cyclists with more than 100 miles of peddling ahead.</p>
