<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2000, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.browardschools.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Broward County Public Schools</a> in Florida received an alarming report. Like many affluent school districts at the time, Broward was considering laptops and wireless networks for its classrooms and 250,000 students. Were there any health risks to worry about?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The district asked <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180603033545/http:/www.emscitek.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Bill P. Curry</a>, a consultant and physicist, to study the matter. The technology, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.stayonthetruth.com/resources/Curry%20letter%20re%20Wireless%20in%20school%20room.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">he reported back</a>, was “likely to be a serious health hazard.” He summarized his most troubling evidence in a large graph labeled “Microwave Absorption in Brain Tissue (Grey Matter).”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The chart showed the <!-- -->dose of radiation received by the brain <!-- -->as rising from left to right, with the increasing frequency of the wireless signal. The slope was gentle at first, but when the line reached the wireless frequencies associated with computer networking, it shot straight up, indicating a dangerous level of exposure.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This graph shows why I am concerned,” Dr. Curry wrote. The body of his report detailed how the radio waves could sow brain cancer, a terrifying disease that kills most of its victims.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the years, Dr. Curry’s warning spread far, resonating with educators, consumers and entire cities as the frequencies of <!-- -->cellphones, cell towers and wireless local networks rose. <!-- -->To no small degree, the blossoming anxiety over the professed health risks of 5G technology can be traced to a single scientist and a single chart. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Except that Dr. Curry and his graph got it wrong. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to experts on the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation, radio waves become safer at higher frequencies, not more dangerous. <!-- -->(Extremely high-frequency energies, such as X-rays, <!-- -->behave differently and do pose a health risk.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In his research, <!-- -->Dr. Curry<!-- --> looked at studies on how radio waves affect tissues <!-- -->isolated <!-- -->in the lab, and misinterpreted the results as applying to cells deep inside the human body. His analysis failed to recognize the protective effect of human skin.

In 1978, Paul Brodeur, an investigative journalist, published “The Zapping of America,” which drew on suggestive but often ambiguous evidence <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/28/archives/books-of-the-times-microwaves-and-men-a-benign-river-interest.html?module=inline" title="">to argue</a> that the <!-- -->growing use of high frequencies<!-- --> could endanger human health.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In contrast, Dr. Curry’s voice was authoritative. <!-- -->He became a private consultant in the 1990s after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/199912/letters.cfm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">federal budget cuts</a> brought <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8059724" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">his research career</a> to an end. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180603033545/http:/www.emscitek.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">He had degrees</a> in physics (1959 and 1965) and electrical engineering (1990).<!-- --> His credentials and decades of experience <!-- -->at federal and industrial laboratories<!-- -->, including the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, seemed to make him a very strong candidate to conduct the Broward study.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He was a very bright guy,” recalled Gary Brown, an expert in the district’s technology unit who worked with Dr. Curry to prepare the reports. But Dr. Curry lacked biological expertise. He could solve atomic and electromagnetic puzzles with ease, but he had little or no formal training in the intricacies of biomedical research.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2000, Dr. Curry, writing on letterhead from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991115074417/http:/emscitek.com:80/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">his home office</a> in the Chicago suburbs, sent the Broward district two reports, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.stayonthetruth.com/resources/Curry%20letter%20re%20Wireless%20in%20school%20room.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the first</a> in February 2000 and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031206113221/http:/www.emrnetwork.org/schools/curry_broward.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the second</a> in September of that year.

He warned that children were especially vulnerable to the cancer risk of wireless technology. “Their brains are developing,” he noted in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.stayonthetruth.com/resources/Curry%20letter%20re%20Wireless%20in%20school%20room.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">his first report</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Curry belonged to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://cyrusfarivar.com/docs/WiFi%20Health/about_us.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a national group of wireless critics</a>, and his two reports for the Broward district soon began <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://chej.org/wp-content/uploads/Cell-Phone-Towers-PUB-129.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">to circulate widely</a> among industry foes. One reached Dr. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.albany.edu/news/experts/8212.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">David O. Carpenter</a>, who for decades had clashed with the science establishment on the health risks of radio waves.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Carpenter’s credentials were impressive. He graduated magna cum laude<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em>from Harvard in 1959 and cum laude from its medical school in<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em>1964. From 1985 to 1997, he served as dean of the School of Public Health at the State University of New York in Albany, and in 2001 became director of its Institute for Health and the Environment, where he still works. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/testimony-of-dr-david-carpenter-with-exhibits.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">His resumé</a> <!-- -->list<!-- -->s hundreds of journal reports, jobs, grants, awards, advisory boards, books and legal declarations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Carpenter stirred global controversy in the 1980s by asserting that high-voltage power lines could cause leukemia in nearby children. <!-- -->He appeared as an authority in Mr. Brodeur’s 1989 book, “Currents of Death.” But federal researchers <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/01/health/long-after-an-80s-scare-suspicion-of-power-lines-prevails.html?module=inline" title="">failed to find solid evidence</a> to support the warnings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In late 2011, Dr. Carpenter introduced Dr. Curry’s graph in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/07/wi-fi_lawsuit_against_portland.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a lawsuit</a> that sought to force the Portland, Ore., public schools to abandon their wireless computer networks. The suit had been filed by a worried parent.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As an expert witness, Dr. Carpenter said in a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.wirelesswatchblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2001/11/Amended-Declaration-of-Dr-David-Carpenter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">legal declaration</a> on Dec. 20, 2011, that the graph showed how the brain’s absorption of radio-wave energy “increases exponentially” as wireless frequencies rise, calling it evidence of grave student danger. The graph “illustrates the problem with the drive of the wireless industry toward ever higher frequencies,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In response to such arguments, the industry noted that it obeys government safety rules. The judge in the Portland case said the court had no jurisdiction over federal regulatory matters, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2012/07/wi-fi_lawsuit_against_portland.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">dismissed the lawsuit</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the setback, Dr. Carpenter’s 2011 declaration, which included Dr. Curry’s graph, kept drawing attention. In 2012, he introduced it as part of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ehtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/testimony-of-dr-david-carpenter-with-exhibits.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">his testimony</a> to a Michigan state board assessing wireless dangers, and <!-- -->it<!-- --> soon <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.wirelesswatchblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2001/11/Amended-Declaration-of-Dr-David-Carpenter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">began circulating</a> online among <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.wirelesswatchblog.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">wireless critics</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And he saw a new danger. Between 2010 and 2012, the frequencies of the newest generation of cellphones, 4G, rose past those typical of the day’s wireless networks. Dr. Carpenter now had a much larger and seemingly more urgent target, especially since cellphones were often held snugly against the head.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is now much more evidence of risks to health, affecting billions of people,” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://bioinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/BioInitiativePressRelease1-1-2013.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">he said</a> in introducing a 1,400-page report on wireless dangers that he edited <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2010/05/for-whom-the-cell-tolls/8/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">with an aide</a>. “The status quo is not acceptable.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://bioinitiative.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">BioInitiative Report</a>, released in late 2012, gained worldwide notice. But mainstream science rejected its <!-- -->conclusions<!-- -->. Two Oxford University researchers <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cdev.13013" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">described it</a> as “scientifically discredited.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unbowed, Dr. Carpenter worked hard to revise established science. In 2012, he became editor in chief of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/reveh" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Reviews on Environmental Health</a>, a quarterly journal.

Instead, it came to be regarded by activists as an established fact of <!-- -->modern science<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The higher the frequency, the more dangerous,” according to Radiation Health Risks, a website, in reference to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.radiationhealthrisks.com/5g-cell-towers-dangerous/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">signals from 5G towers.</a> The idea was echoed by a similar website, 5G Exposed — “Higher frequencies are more dangerous to health” — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.5gexposed.com/2018/07/30/scientific-discussion-about-the-dangers-of-microwaves/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">on a page</a> entitled “Scientific Discussion.” Over all, the site bristled with brain-cancer warnings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Recently, Dr. Carpenter<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmLwuM0_MJg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> told RT America</a>, a Russian television network, that the newest cellphones represented a dire health threat. “The rollout of 5G is very frightening,” he said. “Nobody is going to be able to escape the radiation.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent months, the network has run a series of segments critical of 5G technology. “The higher the frequency, the more dangerous it is to living organisms,” a RT reporter <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpXEyP0WMrk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">told viewers</a> in March<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">. </strong>The show described children as particularly vulnerable.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The new cellphones are to employ a range of radio frequencies up to dozens of times higher than those Dr. Curry identified two decades ago as endangering student health. But mainstream scientists continue to see no evidence of harm from cellphone radio waves. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If phones are linked to cancer, we’d expect to see a marked uptick,” David Robert Grimes, a cancer researcher at the University of Oxford, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/21/mobile-phones-are-not-a-health-hazard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">wrote recently</a> in The Guardian. “Yet we do not.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a recent interview, Dr. Carpenter defended his high-frequency view. “You have all this evidence that cellphone radiation penetrates the brain,” he said. But he conceded after some discussion that the increasingly high frequencies could in fact have a difficult time entering the human body: “There’s some legitimacy to that point of view.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He noted that, in cities, 5G service requires the placement of many antenna towers, because walls, buildings, rain, leaves and other objects can block the high-frequency signals. “That’s why they put the towers so close together,” he said. “The waves don’t penetrate.” If human skin also blocks 5G signals, Dr. Carpenter acknowledged, “maybe it’s not that big a deal.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Curry, now 82, was less forthcoming. In an interview, he said he no longer follows the wireless industry and disavowed any knowledge of having made a scientific error.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They can say whatever they want,” Dr. Curry said of his detractors. “I’ll leave it to the young in the business and let them figure it out.”</p>
