<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">HOUSTON — Major League Baseball said it would investigate an incident in which a Houston Astros executive was said to have shouted at three female reporters in an “offensive and frightening” manner as he praised the team’s closer, Roberto Osuna, who was suspended for domestic violence last year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the Astros’ clubhouse after their pennant-clinching win over the Yankees on Saturday night, Brandon Taubman, the team’s assistant general manager, turned to the female reporters and yelled repeatedly, “Thank God we got Osuna! I’m so glad we got Osuna!,” punctuating the second sentence with an expletive, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/10/22/houston-astros-roberto-osuna-suspension" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a Sports Illustrated column</a> published Monday. The Astros have been criticized heavily for acquiring Osuna last season while he was serving a 75-game suspension for domestic violence.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Domestic violence is extraordinarily serious and everyone in baseball must use care to not engage in any behavior — whether intentional or not — that could be construed as minimizing the egregiousness of an act of domestic violence,” M.L.B. said in a statement Tuesday. “We became aware of this incident through the Sports Illustrated article. The Astros have disputed Sports Illustrated’s characterization of the incident. MLB will interview those involved before commenting further.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the column was published, reporters from other news outlets — including <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/HannahRKeyser/status/1186455802002853888" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Yahoo Sports</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/HunterAtkins35/status/1186474194772598784" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Houston Chronicle</a> — said on Twitter that they had witnessed Taubman’s behavior and corroborated the Sports Illustrated account. Also, an article in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.chron.com/sports/astros/article/Astros-executive-Brandon-Taubman-under-fire-for-14551952.php#photo-18471430" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Chronicle</a> said that no interviews were being conducted during the time of Taubman’s outburst.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/Chandler_Rome/status/1186468857566941184" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a statement</a> late Monday, the Astros disputed Sports Illustrated’s article, calling it “completely irresponsible,” and said Taubman was commenting only on what had happened in the game and was “supporting the player during a difficult time.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Taubman, who worked in the finance industry before joining the Astros in 2013, apologized in a statement on Tuesday for using “inappropriate language.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In retrospect, I realize that my comments were unprofessional and inappropriate,” Taubman said. “My overexuberance in support of a player has been misinterpreted as a demonstration of a regressive attitude about an important social issue.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Osuna had a poor outing on Saturday, giving up a home run and blowing the save in Game 6 of the A.L.C.S., though he was ultimately credited with the win after Jose Altuve’s pennant-winning home run in the bottom of the ninth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/bubbaprog/status/1186478129004584960" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">video of at least one postgame interview</a> shows Osuna in a buoyant mood in the celebration, which was so raucous that players told reporters the team had run out of beer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Osuna, an All-Star for the Toronto Blue Jays in 2017, became available on the trade market in 2018 — at a reduced price — because of his suspension. Jeff Luhnow, the Astros’ general manager, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/sports/baseball/alcs-astros-red-sox-roberto-osuna.html?module=inline" title="">told The New York Times last October</a> that he and the team owner, Jim Crane, expected to be criticized for acquiring him, but that they had done extensive background work on Osuna.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I knew there would be some consequences of making the move, but I didn’t want to not make the move just because of that,” Luhnow said at the time. “I was willing to take that on personally, and Jim and I agreed we were willing to have the organization take it on, subject to us doing our homework as best we could and feeling comfortable with the situation and the potential outcomes.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Did we take a risk?” he added. “No question. Are there people that are still upset about it? No question. We’re doing whatever we can at this point, supporting the relevant causes.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Astros donated $214,000 last year to complete a women’s center for Family Services of Southeast Texas, and have participated in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2018/10/16/houston-astros-join-efforts-to-stop-domestic.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">other initiatives</a> and programs related to domestic violence prevention.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Charges against Osuna were withdrawn in September 2018 after the alleged victim — the mother of his child — declined to travel to Toronto from Mexico and testify against him. Osuna agreed to stay away from the woman for a year and continue counseling.</p>
