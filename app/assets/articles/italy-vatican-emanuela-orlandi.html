<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">ROME — Thirty-six years ago, the teenage daughter of a Vatican City employee vanished off a Rome street on her way home, beginning one of Italy’s most enduring mysteries: Over the years, reports have variously linked her fate to the Sicilian Mafia, the K.G.B. and the plot to assassinate Pope John Paul II.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, the latest trail led her family and a Vatican-appointed forensic scientist to two tombs inside the Vatican walls, the burial places of princesses well over a century dead.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The team only found another mystery: The tombs were empty. Even the bodies of the dead princesses were missing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was yet another strange turn for a family that has suffered false leads, red herrings and intense media attention since the girl, Emanuela Orlandi, disappeared at age 15 on June 22, 1983. Their quest to discover her fate has taken them down many tortuous paths, following up on tips, anonymous letters and reports of sightings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like other well-scrutinized cold cases around the world, Emanuela’s disappearance has inspired many conspiracy theories. She has been linked to the C.I.A., as well as the K.G.B.; to Bulgarian agents and the 1981 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/05/world/agca-says-he-altered-story-over-girl-s-abduction.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FOrlandi%2C%20Emanuela&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=4&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">plot to assassinate</a> Pope John Paul II; to the Mafia and a Roman crime gang; and to an American archbishop <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/25/world/europe/25italy.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FOrlandi%2C%20Emanuela&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=3&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">involved in a major Italian banking scandal</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But clues in the case have been scanty, despite investigators’ efforts.

Giovanni Arcudi, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, began the exhumation of the tomb on Thursday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Arcudi was authorized by the Vatican’s chief prosecutor to analyze the contents of the tomb — as well as the adjacent tomb of Princess Carlotta Frederica of Mecklenburg, who died in 1840 — and take samples for DNA testing. The theory was that Emanuela’s body was inside one of the tombs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Through the family’s lawyer, Laura Sgro, in February, Mr. Orlandi formally asked the Vatican to open the tomb of Princess Sophie. The family received approval last month to have open both tombs opened.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But any hope that the tombs would provide answers to the family were quickly dashed when the Vatican issued a statement hours after the operation began.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There were no human remains nor funerary urns,” the Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said in the statement.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Princess Sophie von Hohenlohe’s tomb led to a large underground space that was “completely empty,” the statement said, while the tomb of Princess Carlotta Frederica of Mecklenburg “had no human remains.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Vatican added that the cemetery had undergone work during the first part of the 19th century, and again in the 1960s and 1970s, and that it would examine the documentation regarding these interventions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, Ms. Sgro said the family was trying to understand why they had been sent on yet another fruitless search.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We expected everything today, but not to find two empty tombs,” she said on the Italian affiliate of Sky News. “We want to know why we were sent there, and why there was nothing.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the tombs were found empty, Mr. Orlandi, Emanuela’s brother and the leader of the family’s decades-long efforts, told the Italian affiliate of Sky News, “Part of me was relieved that Emanuela was not there.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added in a separate interview on Thursday that his family had become used to “illusions and disillusions,” and that they had known that the exhumation could have been a further waste of time. “Still,” he said, “I was surprised that there was nothing at all.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Orlandi said he had called on the Vatican to investigate after receiving several tips from people working in the Vatican, though none of them were there at the time of his sister’s disappearance.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said that he had been “positively surprised” by the Vatican’s assistance. “For the first time in 36 years, the Vatican has concretely done something important” in the case, he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Opening the tomb “signals a change of position,” he said, noting that when he met Pope Francis in 2013, the pope told him that his sister was “in heaven” and left it at that.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Orlandi said the Vatican’s overture had been important, because after decades of denying any links with the case, there was “an admission that there is a possibility of internal responsibility.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he said the missing princesses — even the sarcophagus in Princess Charlotte’s tomb was empty — posed a new dilemma for the Vatican. “Now, even the heirs don’t know where they’ve gone,” he said. “I think this is a problem for the Vatican that will have to be justified.”</p>
