However, Mr. Benson’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/dominoakanique/posts/10100152295142713" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">family</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/coatomc/status/1163111449507635200" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">friends</a> posted about his death on social media, as did the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/TexasFootball/status/1163143065235808256?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">University of Texas, where Mr. Benson had played football</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Benson was a four-year starter for the Texas Longhorns football team. As a senior in 2004, he was recognized as the nation’s top running back when he received the <!-- -->Doak Walker Award<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He finished his career at Texas with 5,540 rushing yards, which ranks second in school history behind Ricky Williams and 10th overall in Division I history, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/leaders/rush-yds-player-career.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to College Football Reference</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s an unbelievably sad day with the news of the passing of Cedric Benson,” Tom Herman, the Texas Longhorns head coach, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/TexasFootball/status/1163176187608408065" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said on Twitter</a>. “We lost a true Longhorn legend, one of the best running backs in college football history and a really special man.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2005, the Chicago Bears selected Mr. Benson with the fourth overall pick in the draft.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While his three seasons in Chicago were considered disappointing, Mr. Benson found more success with the Cincinnati Bengals, where he surpassed 1,000 rushing yards in three of his four seasons with the team. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Perhaps the highlight of his professional career came in a playoff loss following the 2009 season when he rushed for a franchise playoff record 169 yards and a touchdown in a 24-14 loss to the Jets. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Benson played one final season with the Green Bay Packers in 2012, but was limited to five games because of a foot injury. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the years, Mr. Benson had multiple run-ins with the law. He faced <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hookem.com/story/ex-ut-star-cedric-benson-guilty-lesser-charge-dwi-case/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">driving while intoxicated charges</a> in 2008 and 2017, which were eventually dismissed. He also faced a criminal trespassing charge in 2003 and, in later years, assault charges. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sam Bassett, Mr. Benson’s lawyer, said in a <!-- -->statement<!-- --> that his client was “imperfect in some respects,” but that “once Cedric was your friend, you understood how kind, sensitive and loyal he was as a man.” </p>
