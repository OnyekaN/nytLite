<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A Chicago man is accused of promising to “slaughter and murder” doctors, patients and visitors at an abortion clinic, a threat that the authorities said Monday he issued on iFunny.co, an online forum where he followed an Ohio man charged last week over similar threats, court records show.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The man in Chicago, Farhan Sheikh, 19, has been charged with transmitting a threat in interstate commerce, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/pr/federal-charges-filed-against-chicago-man-who-allegedly-posted-online-threats-violence" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said on Monday in a news release</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Sheikh, who was arrested last week and is in custody, wrote of plans to attack the clinic, which the authorities did not identify, this Friday, according to a criminal affidavit.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I will proceed to slaughter and murder any doctor, patient, or visitor I see in the area and I will not back down,” the iFunny user “awarded” — which the authorities linked to Mr. Sheikh — wrote on the website on Aug. 13. “Consider this a warning for anyone visiting.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a separate post, the user issued further clarification: “To all the F.B.I. agents in this app, I am NOT a satirical account. I post what I mean, and I WILL carry out what I post.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The user also lamented the arrest this month of the Ohio man, Justin Olsen, 18, who was accused last week of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/us/justin-olsen-boardman-ohio.html?module=inline#" title="">supporting mass shootings and targeting federal agents and Planned Parenthood</a> in posts on iFunny. The authorities seized more than a dozen rifles and about 10,000 rounds of ammunition from Mr. Olsen’s residence, according to a court filing. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authorities have said little about the clinic that Mr. Sheikh is accused of targeting, but described it as a “women’s reproductive health clinic.” The court filing said it was about four miles from his residence. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When arrested on Friday, Mr. Sheikh described the posts as a “joke” and said that he had chosen the clinic and date at random, the affidavit said. Mr. Olsen similarly told the F.B.I. that his statements were jokes, according to a court filing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A lawyer representing Mr. Sheikh declined to comment on Monday.</p>
