<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An 18-month Senate investigation has found that the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and U.S.A. Gymnastics “knowingly concealed” the sexual abuse of gymnasts by a team doctor, and two leading senators have proposed greater congressional oversight of Olympic-related sports.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The investigation described “alarming and dysfunctional systems” that allowed emotional, physical and sexual abuse to persist in sports like gymnastics, swimming, figure skating and taekwondo.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a result of the investigation, Senators Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, and Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, will introduce a bipartisan bill on Tuesday that would hold the Olympic committee and national sports governing bodies to more stringent legal accountability for failing to protect athletes. The bill is known as the Empowering Olympic and Amateur Athletes Act of 2019.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Should it become law, the bill would permit Congress to dissolve the board of directors of the Olympic committee and to decertify offending national governing bodies. It would also require the Olympic committee to provide greater oversight of sports federations and to establish clear procedures to report abuse.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Blumenthal described the bill as a “moment of reckoning” for the Olympic committee to demonstrate its willingness to create a “seismic cultural shift” in the protection of athletes from abuse. If the Olympic committee failed in its responsibilities, Mr. Blumenthal warned, it “will be disbanded” by Congress.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a conference call with reporters on Monday, he said that the Olympic committee had taken “baby steps” toward reform but had undergone “nowhere near the kind of major reforms that need to be done.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement Tuesday, Sarah Hirshland, chief executive of the Olympic committee, said making athletes safer and giving them a bigger voice are central to her organization’s mission.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This legislation is consistent with that approach and we applaud Congress for their continued work on this critically important issue,” she said. “There are sections in the proposed legislation that, while conceptually appropriate, could result in unintended consequences and disruption for athletes in operational reality. We look forward to working with Senators Moran, Blumenthal and others in Congress to address these areas, make athletes more safe, and make Olympic and Paralympic organizations in the U.S. as exceptional as the athletes they serve.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The introduction of the Senate bill comes after Congress displayed a lack of urgency in its mandated oversight of the Olympic committee until victims of Lawrence G. Nassar, a former gymnastics team doctor, came forward to make accusations against him to the news media and in legal proceedings. Dr. Nassar is expected to spend the rest of his life in prison after being <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/24/sports/larry-nassar-victims.html?module=inline" title="">accused of molesting hundreds of girls and women</a> and being convicted of sexual misconduct.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">[<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">More than 160 women say Larry Nassar sexually abused them. </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/24/sports/larry-nassar-victims.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Here are his accusers in their own words.</em></a>]</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Monday, Mr. Blumenthal recounted being told by one of Dr. Nassar’s victims that the Olympic committee and U.S.A. Gymnastics had failed the athletes. The athlete then pleaded with the senator, “Congress cannot fail us.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For decades, the governing bodies of Olympic-related sports have acted with a large degree of autonomy and have been slow to report malfeasance. As details of Dr. Nassar’s abuse of scores of gymnasts became public beginning in 2016, the Olympic committee claimed it could do nothing to hold leaders of the gymnastics federation accountable because it was an independent body. The Senate bill would enhance the committee’s ability to discipline sports federations that did not protect athletes from sexual misconduct.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The bill, Mr. Moran said, is also intended to counter the Olympic committee’s long-held argument that it was responsible for athletes only from the time they were named to Olympic teams through their competition in the Winter or Summer Games. That lack of oversight has left many athletes vulnerable to abuse.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Dozens of officials </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/sports/larry-nassar-case-scandal.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">have been ousted or charged</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> in the Nassar abuse scandal.]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Olympic committee’s responsibility for the well-being of athletes lies “in a broader array of arenas and a wider time frame than perhaps what some tried to indicate” during the gymnastics sexual abuse case, Mr. Moran said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among the most significant aspects of the bill is that it would require the Olympic committee to pay the U.S. Center for SafeSport $20 million a year for operating costs, a more than threefold increase from the current $6.2 million.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">SafeSport, an independent nonprofit organization, is charged with investigating and preventing sexual misconduct in Olympic sports, but it has acknowledged a backlog of cases because it is underfunded and understaffed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government, along with the Olympic committee, has played a role in the inadequacy of SafeSport. A three-year grant from the Justice Department, worth $2.2 million, is intended for education and prevention programs and cannot be used to reduce the case backlog or hire investigators, a spokesman for SafeSport said this year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To ensure the independence of SafeSport, the Senate bill would prohibit officials employed by the Olympic committee or a national governing body from serving in the organization. SafeSport would also be required to report within 72 hours any attempt by the Olympic committee or a sports federation to interfere with the center’s work. SafeSport would also be required to publish a comprehensive, publicly-available list of people barred from Olympic sports for abusing athletes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Senate bill is also designed to give athletes a greater say by increasing their representation on the Olympic committee’s board of directors to one-third from one-fifth. The bill also requires that athletes comprise one-third of the governing structures of Olympic-related sports federations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Senate investigation follows <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/sports/usoc-investigation-report.html?module=inline" title="">a blistering report</a>, commissioned by the Olympic committee and issued last December, that accused two of the highest-ranking United States Olympic officials of doing nothing to investigate, report or stop Dr. Nassar despite learning in 2015 that he had been accused of sexual abuse. That was a year before the accusations became public in a newspaper investigation by The Indianapolis Star.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of those officials, Scott Blackmun, the Olympic committee’s chief executive, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/sports/scott-blackmun-usoc-nassar.html?module=inline" title="">resigned under pressure</a> in February 2018. Another official, Alan Ashley, the Olympic committee’s chief of sports performance, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/sports/usoc-scott-blackmun-nassar.html?module=inline" title="">was fired</a> in December 2018. That month, the searing report by the law firm Ropes and Gray found that failures by the Olympic committee to intervene in Dr. Nassar’s abuse helped create “an ecosystem that facilitated his criminal acts.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Steve Penny, a former chief executive of U.S.A. Gymnastics, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/sports/steve-penny-resigns-as-usa-gymnastics-president.html?module=inline" title="">resigned in 2017</a> amid the sexual abuse scandal. He <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/18/sports/steve-penny-gymnastics-arrest-tampering.html?module=inline" title="">was arrested</a> last October after being indicted on charges of tampering with evidence in the case. He has pleaded not guilty.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This month, the Olympic committee received harsh rebukes from critics <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/sports/olympics-scott-blackmun.html?module=inline" title="">for<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>paying Mr. Blackmun $2.4 million in severance</a>. On Monday, Mr. Blumenthal noted that he and Mr. Moran had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/sports/usoc-scott-blackmun-nassar.html?module=inline" title="">referred Mr. Blackmun for criminal investigation</a> last December, accusing him of making false statements to Congress in the sexual abuse investigation. Mr. Blumenthal urged the Olympic committee to avoid paying or to attempt to recover the $2.4 million, calling the severance payment to Mr. Blackmun “inexplicable and inexcusable.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Blackmun, in effect, was one of the poster boys for what went wrong here,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “The fault was to put medals and money above morals.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Blackmun did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p>
