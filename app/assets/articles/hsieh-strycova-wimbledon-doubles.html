<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WIMBLEDON, England — Hsieh Su-wei and Barbora Strycova were ready hours before the scheduled start of the Wimbledon women’s doubles final, which was planned as the third match on Centre Court on Saturday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After Simona Halep needed just 56 minutes <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/sports/tennis/serena-williams-simona-halep-wimbledon.html?module=inline" title="">to beat Serena Williams</a> in the first match on Centre Court, it looked like they might get on earlier than expected.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then, the men’s doubles final lasted four hours and 57 minutes. As it reached a fifth set, tournament supervisors told Hsieh and Strycova their match was being postponed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I was feeling good yesterday in my practice,” Hsieh lamented.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Me too,” Strycova agreed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They were rescheduled for Sunday evening after the men’s singles final, a spot normally reserved for the mixed doubles final. Mixed doubles was, in turn, relegated to No. 1 Court.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Again, Hsieh and Strycova waited. The men’s match, between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, lasted four hours and 55 minutes, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/sports/tennis/federer-vs-djokovic.html?module=inline" title="">with Djokovic beating Federer</a> in the first final-set tiebreak in a singles match at Wimbledon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hsieh coped with the waiting Sunday by nervously eating: bananas, chocolate cookies, two potatoes, a plate of vegetables.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">”She was eating all the time,” Strycova said of Hsieh.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hsieh said she was “glad Wimbledon changed the rules” and brought a final-set tiebreak, at 12-12, to this year’s tournament.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Otherwise I will keep eating and I will get fat,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hsieh and Strycova, both strong singles players, were the first Wimbledon pairing not to drop a set en route to the women’s doubles title since Venus and Serena Williams did it 10 years ago.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though their timing was impeccable, and their 6-2, 6-4 win over Gabriela Dabrowski and Xu Yifan was efficient, they still found themselves late to the ball on Sunday — the champions’ ball, that is, to which guests had already begun to arrive while the doubles champions were still on site.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Normally players pick their formal outfits for the soiree after winning a title; Strycova and Hsieh made sure to get theirs in the morning.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Strycova said she made her choice with consultation from “a little helper”: Halep, the women’s singles champion, who was also there to pick out her dress on Sunday morning.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For Hsieh, the process was easy. “You know the girls love pink gowns,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Strycova will accessorize her look with a new crown: the No. 1 WTA ranking in doubles, which she clinched with the victory, capping off a career-redefining tournament that also saw her reach her first major singles semifinal. She called it “two weeks of amazing moments I will never forget.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Strycova said achieving the top doubles ranking had been a “really big goal” from the beginning of the season.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Especially here at this moment, this tournament, my favorite place — yes, it’s a fairy tale,” Strycova said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fittingly, that fairy tale now finishes at the ball. At midnight, rather than a pumpkin, she will turn into the official top player in women’s doubles.</p>
