<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This has been an ominous year for reproductive rights in America, with states including <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/us/heartbeat-bill-georgia.html?module=inline" title="">Georgia</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/abortion-law-alabama.html?module=inline" title="">Alabama</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/08/13/us/ap-us-abortion-tennessee.html?module=inline" title="">and now Tennessee</a> in a race to the bottom to pass the most extreme anti-abortion law in the nation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But while those high-profile abortion bans make their way through the courts — they were designed to provoke legal challenges that could <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/opinion/roe-wade-abortion.html?module=inline" title="">threaten Roe v. Wade</a> — a more immediate threat to women’s health care has been brewing. The Trump administration has quietly been working <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/opinion/title-x-rule.html?module=inline" title="">to gut the Title X family planning program</a>, which helps poor women afford birth control, cancer screenings and testing for H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted infections. On Monday, the administration’s efforts paid off: Planned Parenthood, which serves about <!-- -->40 percent<!-- --> of Title X patients around the country, felt forced to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/health/planned-parenthood-title-x.html?module=inline" title="">withdraw from the program</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The nearly 50-year-old Title X program is an unsung hero of American public health. In 2017, Title X clinics served <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hhs.gov/opa/sites/default/files/title-x-fpar-2017-national-summary.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">more than four million women</a>, 42 percent of them uninsured, according to the <!-- -->federal <!-- -->Office of Population Affairs, which administers the program. The <!-- -->Guttmache<!-- -->r Institute, a research group <!-- -->that supports reproductive rights,<!-- --> found that Title X clinics helped prevent more than <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/report/publicly-funded-contraceptive-services-us-clinics-2015" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">822,000</a> unintended pregnancies in 2015. The institute <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2014/10/return-investment-fuller-assessment-benefits-and-cost-savings-us-publicly-funded" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">estimates</a> that for every dollar the federal government spends on family planning, it saves more than $7. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Trump administration’s new <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/health/trump-defunds-planned-parenthood.html?module=inline" title="">Title X rule</a>, announced in February, will lay waste to that progress. The rule bars facilities that receive Title X money from providing abortions, even with a separate source of money, as has been required by law for decades. It also prohibits clinics from referring patients for an abortion at a different facility — in other words, staff members would effectively have to pretend that abortion is not a legal medical option.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And that’s exactly the point for this administration: to treat abortion as though it were illegal, until perhaps that wishful thinking becomes reality. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/19/752438119/planned-parenthood-out-of-title-x-over-trump-rule" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said</a> last week that by leaving Title X, Planned Parenthood is “choosing to place a higher priority on the ability to refer for abortion instead of continuing to receive federal funds to provide a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and services.” According to the Trump administration, there’s abortion, and then there’s “acceptable” care.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the same time, making it <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/opinion/trump-birth-control-backward.html?module=inline" title="">harder for women to get birth control</a> isn’t an accidental side effect of this rule change. Current and former members of the administration have expressed opposition to birth control, and <!-- -->one of only three<!-- --> new recipients of Title X grants this year is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/us/politics/trump-grant-abortion.html?module=inline" title="">a Catholic-affiliated group</a> that does not provide contraception beyond guidance on the so-called rhythm method.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In response to the administration’s actions, the House in June passed a <!-- -->bill <!-- -->that would block the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/us/politics/trump-funding-abortion-restrictions.html?module=inline" title="">domestic gag rule</a>, as the Title X rule change is sometimes called. Title X supporters could urge their senators to follow suit. Other ways to help: Ask your state leaders to fill any gaps in funding caused by this new rule, and look into directly supporting a local family planning program or a clinic that’s lost its Title X funding.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This whole sorry affair is a reminder that while many Americans are rightly afraid of a future without reproductive rights, in some ways that future is already here. Some of the most dangerous threats to reproductive rights have been creeping up on us for years.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
