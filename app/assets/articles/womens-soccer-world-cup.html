<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s a little<!-- --> <!-- -->bitter<!-- -->sweet that so many girls turned out to cheer on the national women’s soccer team at a <!-- -->ticker-tape<!-- --> parade in Manhattan on Wednesday, wearing their favorite players’ jerseys or clutching posters of Megan Rapinoe, <!-- -->a<!-- --> top scorer in the Women’s World Cup. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Those girls will run harder, wake up earlier and practice a little longer so maybe one day they too <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://deadspin.com/rose-lavelle-dribbled-her-way-into-world-cup-immortalit-1836182147" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">can shoot a goal with as much power and grace as Rose Lavelle</a>. That’s because they think it’s about more than just soccer. They think America rewards excellence. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And the<!-- -->n they’ll grow up<!-- --> and<!-- --> learn that if they want to be<!-- --> like their heroes, they’ll have to fight every step of the way. Because for women, even world championships don’t guarantee equality. That’s why we have to keep the pr<!-- -->essure on. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We know this because we’ve been here before. Like most of the current U.S. national tea<!-- -->m, I was a <!-- -->kid<!-- --> when I first saw that iconic photo of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/sports/soccer/brandi-chastain-womens-world-cup-image.html?module=inline" title="">Brandi Chastain</a> in 1999, ecstatic from scoring the winning goal for the United States in the Women’s World Cup. It was on the cover of every news magazine <!-- -->I encountered,<!-- --> including the Newsweek that arrived at my home that summer. The cover read “Girls Rule!” (Nevermind that Ms. Chastain was a 30-something working woman.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The photo was exciting. It showed a woman who<!-- --> <!-- -->had<!-- --> l<!-- -->ost control. She had torn off her shirt and skidded to he<!-- -->r knees in euphoria in her sports bra. She looked joyous and strong and reckless. She looked so cool. I grabbed the issue and took it straight to my room to read the article, which explained in breathless terms that the moment was surely a turning point for women athletes. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Just like the images of this year’s triumphant World Cup team, that photo of Ms. Chastain’s celebration achieved what it was meant to do: It inspired girls like me. But in retrospect, it’s also kind of sad. We didn’t know how rare those images were going to be.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now those girls who taped that picture of Ms. Chastain to our bedroom walls <!-- -->are grown-ups. <!-- -->We became managers, doctors, journalists, just as we were told we could. Some of us even became Olympians. And we’re still fighting the same fights.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States women’s soccer team has become an excruciating example of a scenario we’ve seen play out for decades: Little girls are told to follow their dreams, and to excel, until they become women and expect be paid for it. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Twenty-eight national team players sued the United States Soccer Federation in March, claiming it pays them less, provides unequal playing conditions and does not promote their games as much as it does those of the men’s team. <!-- -->If both teams played and won the same number of “friendly” matches in a year, according to the lawsuit, the women would earn, at most, $99,000. The men, $263,320 on average.<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the score hovered at a draw in the World Cup final last Sunday, I couldn’t forget that if the American women didn’t win, it would probably undercut the discussion around their push for equal pay. Even though that would make them second in the world, and after they won the last tournament in 2015. (The last time the American men won a medal in the World Cup it was 1930.) To get what they deserve, the women need to be perfect. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Maybe that’s part of why the team ran up scores like 13-0 during this World Cup; they need a narrative of <!-- -->dominance<!-- --> in order to make their case to get paid the same as men who aren’t even on the same level.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And they<!-- --> won while having every quote, every <!-- -->celebratory gesture<!-- --> scrutinized by the public and the president alike. Americans who didn’t like how Alex Morgan sipped tea or how Megan Rapinoe refused to sing the national anthem even rooted for them to lose. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Of course, there are reasons the men’s team makes more money; there always are. But one of the more intractable excuses is that the world thinks of men’s sports, <!-- -->like many men’s ventures,<!-- --> as profitable businesses worth investing in. Women’s sports are relegated to inspiration. Why else would the United States women’s team, composed of working adults, have the unfathomably patronizing slogan “Dare to Shine”? </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Money makes money — women can play and win all they want. (Provided we are grateful for the opportunity.) But the system is created by men, for men. We pay for what we value. And if we invest in women’s soccer as though there won’t be an audience, we’ll make that come true. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Today, 40 percent of all athletes are female — inspired by role models like Brandi Chastain, as this team was. But they receive only 4 percent of media cov<!-- -->erag<!-- -->e. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since 2000, the <!-- -->only female athlete <!-- -->to achieve the distinction of Sports Illustrated’s athlete of the year has been Serena W<!-- -->illiams<!-- -->. She’s also chronically the only woman on the list of the world’s 100 top-paid athletes — one of the best athletes of all time, right there this year at No. 63. Of course, even <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a28209579/serena-williams-us-open-2018-essay/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">she had to fight</a> hard for what she’s earned. And rewarding a best-in-history woman in a sea of men is not equality. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At a press conference after the Wimbledon final on Saturday, a female reporter had the gall to ask Serena Williams how she would respond to the criticism that she should stop fighting for equality and just focus on tennis. “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YpnDBQyi_g" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The day I stop fighting for equality</a> and for people that look like you and me,” she said, “will be the day I’m in my grave.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After all these years, I still admire Brandi Chastain. I played soccer as I grew up and became a competitive distance runner. That photo of her is timeless; it has stayed with me far longer than that World Cup game.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That’s partly because there wasn’t the predicted flood of famous female athletes, in soccer or otherwise, to take its place. It remains disappointingly remarkable to see a woman celebrated for her athletic achievements (at least, when it comes to celebrating what her body can do, as opposed to what it can look like).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The photos of Megan Rapinoe and her victory pose also are likely to stand out to the girls looking on for decades. But I hope the images <!-- -->endure<!-- --> for showing that this time, things changed. </p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Lindsay Crouse (<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/lindsaycrouse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">@lindsaycrouse</a>) is a senior staff editor for Op-Docs.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
