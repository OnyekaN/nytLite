But that site, called <!-- -->Tranquillity Base<!-- -->, may not be as enduring as the legacy those prints represent.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Is there anything stopping you from just driving over Neil Armstrong’s footprints?” said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/steven-a-mirmina/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Steve Mirmina</a>, a specialist in space law at Georgetown University. “No. There’s nothing. There’s no rule, there’s no U.S. domestic law, or no international treaty obligation to preserve them.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In other words, anyone capable of visiting <!-- -->Tranquillity Base<!-- --> could alter what many believe to be an indispensable part of humanity’s heritage, a place that is analogous to archaeological sites on Earth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Where the objects are, how they’re sitting there — that tells the actual real story and history of humans on the moon,” said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://law.olemiss.edu/faculty-directory/michelle-hanlon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Michelle Hanlon</a>, a space lawyer and co-founder of the nonprofit organization <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.forallmoonkind.org/moonkind-mission/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">For All Moonkind</a>, which is developing an international framework for lunar site preservation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">You would not even have to go there to obliterate Armstrong’s footprints.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Send a robot,” Mr. Mirmina said. “Just use some joysticks on the ground and drive over them.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Losing lunar historical sites is not an abstract concern. With a few crucial exceptions, what happens off-world stays off-world, and activities on the lunar surface are largely unregulated. Various private space actors have already demonstrated a proclivity for celestial shenanigans: Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/science/falcon-heavy-spacex-launch.html?module=inline" title="">launched his car into space</a>. Rocket Lab, the builder of small rockets, shot <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/science/rocket-lab-humanity-star.html?module=inline" title="">a disco ball-like object into orbit </a>from New Zealand. And <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/business/cellphones-moon-4g-network.html?module=inline" title="">Vodafone</a> has hinted at building a cell tower on the moon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More seriously, a modern-day space race between governments and private companies is fast-tracking plans to return both humans and robotic landers to the lunar surface. One of those companies, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ptscientists.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">PTScientists</a> of Berlin, announced a plan to land near — and examine — the site of <!-- -->Apollo 17<!-- -->, <!-- -->where humans last traipsed across the lunar surface<!-- -->. Now, some are saying, it is time to get serious about preserving humanity’s heritage on the moon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Earth, multiple layers of legislation, both international and domestic, protect many sites of humanity’s heritage, an array including<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/373" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> the megaliths at Stonehenge</a>, Yosemite National Park and the recently listed Smith-Carter House in Madison, Tenn.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In space, it is different. As decreed by the United Nations’ Outer Space Treaty in 1967 — signed by a multitude of nations while the United States and Soviet Union battled for primacy in orbit — space “shall be free for exploration and use by all,” with open access to all areas of celestial bodies.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Put simply, space is the province of humankind. No nation can “own” it or claim it, by means of use or occupation or otherwise.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That complicates setting up protected areas or restricting activities in or under the six Apollo landing sites. Or the spot where the Soviet Luna 2 spacecraft landed in 1959 and became the first human-made piece of hardware to touch another world. Or the site where, in January, China’s Chang’e-4 spacecraft achieved the first landing on the far side of the moon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Arguably, by saying, ‘Oh, this bootprint is an artifact, don’t step on it’ — the U.S. would be making a territorial claim to the area where that bootprint is,” Ms. Hanlon said. “And as you can imagine, that would not be a very diplomatic thing to do.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To be clear, she added, individual objects on the moon remain the property of the nations that put them there; that is laid out in Article VIII of the Outer Space Treaty. (So, fair warning, retrieving and selling the golf balls Apollo 14’s Alan Shepard lobbed into oblivion or painting a smiley face on China’s Yutu rover will most likely land you in a world of trouble.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But so far, there has not been an easy way <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://spacegrant.nmsu.edu/lunarlegacies/archeologicalsitemap.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">to preserve the landing sites as they are</a>, with moon buggy treads and footprints intact, in the way an archaeologist of the future might want to study them. Amending the Outer Space Treaty could take decades, and there is no other obvious route to an international agreement.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We lose so much on Earth inadvertently,” said<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://anthropology.nmsu.edu/anthropology-faculty/oleary/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> Beth O’Leary</a> of New Mexico State University, an archaeologist who has proposed preserving humanity’s off-world history. “Here, we have the opportunity to plan for what to preserve for the future — it’s always bad to do things kind of in hindsight.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That does not mean people have not tried to protect humanity’s lunar heritage.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Attempts to classify the Apollo landing sites as American national parks failed precisely because that would violate the Outer Space Treaty. And the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, which designates world heritage sites, usually considers nominations only by countries exercising sovereignty over their proposed site — which can therefore only be on Earth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In July 2011, NASA <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/617743main_NASA-USG_LUNAR_HISTORIC_SITES_RevA-508.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">issued a nonbinding set of recommendations</a> aimed at preserving the six Apollo “heritage” sites and their associated artifacts. At the time, private teams were racing to be first on the lunar surface to claim <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://lunar.xprize.org/prizes/google-lunar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the Google Lunar X Prize</a>, and one of the contest’s bonus prizes would go to a spacecraft that visited an Apollo site.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts fear future visitors to the moon could be similarly motivated, and with perhaps less oversight.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If you’re a couple of college students and you have a rover and iPhone, of course you’re going to want to drive around and go to the Apollo landing sites,” Mr. Mirmina said. “You’d want to take a photo of the first footprints, maybe see if the flag is still standing, or take a photo of all the bags of poop that NASA left behind on the moon.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thus NASA laid out guidelines for preserving those locations, including restrictions on overflights, boundaries for touchdown and a prohibition on close visits to the Apollo 11 and 17 sites because they “carry special historical and cultural significance.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then, the space agency reached an agreement with companies vying for the moon: They would need to abide by NASA’s guidelines if they wanted NASA support.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s carefully written, and NASA actually found some fairly clever ways of trying to enforce that,” said<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://elliott.gwu.edu/henry-hertzfeld" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> Henry Hertzfeld</a>, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last year, the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the White House issued <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Protecting-and-Preserving-Apollo-Program-Lunar-Landing-Sites-and-Artifacts.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">its own document</a> outlining the necessity of securing those sites. But Dr. Hertzfeld says it is a long road to building a functional and enforceable international legal framework for preservation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet in May, Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, introduced a bill, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s1694" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space Act</a>, which directs any federal agency that issues licenses for lunar activities to require that companies comply with the 2011 NASA guidelines. The bill, co-sponsored by Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, is headed for a vote in the full Senate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“These are the first archaeological sites outside of planet Earth and as we move toward being a spacefaring society and civilization, it is only right that we protect those giant leaps,” Mr. Peters said. He added that “once they’re degraded, they’re lost forever to humanity.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While many key moon sites are American, proponents say the endeavor to preserve lunar sites will not — and cannot — be America-centric.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is a very human story and we want people all over the world to embrace it as a human story,” Ms. Hanlon said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the fact that so many sites are the result of American achievements might portend trouble.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Restricting access to historical sites on the moon might “limit the freedom of exploration,” Mari Eldholm, government relations manager for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://ptscientists.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">PTScientists</a>, said in an email, and could also be seen as one country appropriating something that belongs to all of humanity.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">PTScientists is designing a mission to the Apollo 17 site. As envisioned, that mission would employ a lander and two lunar rovers. One goal would be investigating how Apollo artifacts have been affected by nearly 50 years in the lunar environment, which necessarily involves altering the site’s present state.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And right now, PTScientists could modify the Apollo 17 terrain in any way it wants — although Ms. Eldholm said the company would do its best to follow and respect NASA’s guidelines. But she emphasizes that an international conversation about balancing lunar preservation, exploration and freedom is essential.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We believe there is a need for a discussion on who decides, and what, to preserve,” she said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there is no simple way to address preservation in today’s international arena.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You get into the world political situation today and it’s not one of making treaties,” Dr. Hertzfeld said. “You’ve got more nations that are technically capable of accessing space, and doing a lot up there.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Hanlon — whose group, For All Moonkind, continues raising the issue at United Nations assemblies — says that trying to protect those sites is worth the effort. Losing these records of humanity’s first accomplishments in space would be devastating for future generations, she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’ve done it wrong so many times on Earth, but we have a lot of examples and experiences to work from,” she said. “I think we can do it right on the moon and other celestial bodies.”</p>
