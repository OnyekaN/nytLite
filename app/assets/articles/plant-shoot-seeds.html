After all, you might not want your baby seedlings crowding your soil or tangling your roots. Dandelions, for instance, cast their seeds floating in the wind to lawns up and down the street.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/science/hairyflower-wild-petunia-seeds.html?module=inline" title="">Other plants employ ballistics</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Chinese witch hazel, native to western China, is a favorite of landscapers with its yellow blooms. “By coincidence, we had a twig of this plant in an office, and it started shooting the seeds,” said <!-- -->Simon Poppinga<!-- -->, a <!-- -->researcher<!-- --> studying plant biomechanics at the University of Freiburg in Germany and<!-- --> the study’s lead author<!-- -->. “This triggered our interest in it, so we started investigating, and it became more interesting and even more interesting and even more interesting.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Taking advantage of high-speed cameras, botanists have in recent years captured the intricacies of such high-flying reproductive mechanisms.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the fruits of a witch hazel plant dried out, the German researchers discovered that the top part of a woody capsule around the seed split open. The middle part of the capsule constricted, as if it were squeezed by fingers, until the seed, about the size of a pumpkin seed, broke free and flew out at about 28 miles per hour. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You hear the crack and then it shoots out,” said <!-- -->Thomas Speck<!-- -->, a botany professor at Freiburg. “The fascinating thing is there is no explosive mechanism. There’s this squeezing mechanism.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Poppinga, Dr. Speck and their colleagues reported their findings on Wednesday in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2019.0327" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the Journal of the Royal Society Interface</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As it flies, the seed is spinning fast, 12,000 to 25,000 revolutions a minute. As with the spiraling of a well-thrown football, the spinning enables the seed to travel farther than it would have, landing several yards away.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s exceptional to launch it with this spiral,” said <!-- -->Dwight Whitaker<!-- -->, a physics professor at Pomona College in California who was not involved with the witch hazel research but who has studied how <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/science/hairyflower-wild-petunia-seeds.html?module=inline" title="">a different plant, the hairyflower wild petunia, catapults its seeds</a> into the wild. “It’s just really cool how they’ve documented how it does it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What the researchers don’t quite understand is how seeds from different fruits on the same <!-- -->witch hazel plant<!-- --> can spin in different directions, as if a quarterback sometimes throws right-handed half of the time and left-handed half of the time.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to using high-speed cameras, the researchers also put the plants inside magnetic resonance imaging machines so that they could examine the hidden structures within the plant and the fruit without having to cut it apart.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We do not need to use any radiation or sample preparation which could be damaging to the sample,” said <!-- -->Linnea Hesse<!-- -->, a postdoctoral researcher who performed the M.R.I. scans. “We can basically perform repetitive imaging on the same plant as it grows over time.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The same M.R.I. techniques could be used to study the movements of other plants such as how the Venus fly trap catches and eats bugs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The German researchers want to study in more detail how the witch hazel launches its seeds, in particular how it is applying a torque to make it spin. They imagine that perhaps it could inspire engineers to design a new kind of sensor that detects when the humidity is low and then opens a valve in response.</p>
