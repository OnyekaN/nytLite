A lot of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/opinion/beto-2020-democratic-debate.html?module=inline" title="">other journalists</a> have too. But campaigns are longer and more fluid than we journalists often acknowledge. And this week’s debates made me realize a real strength of the O’Rourke campaign.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Along with Joe Biden (who has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/01/opinion/debate-winners-losers.html?module=inline" title="">his own challenges</a>), O’Rourke is the only top-tier candidate who isn’t trying to swim against the tide of public opinion on a major policy issue.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For that reason, I can imagine — in a way I hadn’t previously considered — an O’Rourke comeback later this year, as the field of candidates winnows. I’m not saying that outcome is likely. At this point, though, it’s hard to know what <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">is</em> likely.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/opinion/the-argument-mueller-report-electoral-college.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first thing to understand is that the debate field is soon going to be narrowed. This week’s debates were the last before the bar for qualifying rises. As of now, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/us/politics/next-democratic-debate.html?module=inline" title="">only seven candidates</a> have met the requirements — in terms of polling and number of donors — for the September debate: Biden, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, O’Rourke, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On many big policy issues, all of those candidates have the same basic positions as most Americans, because Democrats generally are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/opinion/democrats-economics.html?module=inline" title="">more in tune</a> with Americans’ policy views than Republicans.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most Americans say they favor a higher minimum wage, higher taxes on the rich, expanded Medicare, tighter gun control, more financial aid for college and more spending on clean energy, among other Democratic priorities. But there are at least two big exceptions: Most Americans are opposed to both the forced elimination of private health insurance — that is, mandatory Medicare for All — and the decriminalization of illegal border crossings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A recent <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_1907190926.pdf#page=3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll</a>, for example, asked what people thought of “Medicare for all — that is, a national health insurance program for all Americans that replaces private health insurance.” Only 41 percent said it was a good idea, while 54 percent called it a bad idea. <!-- -->More starkly<!-- -->, only 27 percent said “decriminalizing illegal border crossings” was a good idea, compared with 66 percent who called it a bad idea.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s true that self-identified Democrats were more positive about these ideas, with most favoring the elimination of private health insurance and slightly less than half favoring decriminalization of the border. But Democrats are also desperate to beat President Trump. Many say they want a nominee with the best possible chance of winning.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">O’Rourke and Biden are the only candidates among the top seven who haven’t taken an unpopular stance on one or both of these two issues. <!-- -->O’Rourke<!-- --> favors a big but voluntary expansion of Medicare. On the border, he opposes the idea of turning illegal entry into the United States into a civil offense.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I expect that people who come here follow our laws,” O’Rourke said during Tuesday’s debate. The point here isn’t the policy minutiae, which most Americans won’t follow. (Plus, Democrats don’t need to decriminalize border crossings to stop immigrants from being put in cages or families being separated — as the Trump administration is unconscionably doing.) The point is that O’Rourke’s stance sends a clear message that he, like most Americans, cares about strong border security.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The other five top-tier Democrats favor border decriminalization, while Sanders, Warren and Harris (with a delay) favor eliminating private health insurance. Yes, of course, the other five have their own strengths, starting with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/opinion/sunday/elizabeth-warren-president-2020.html?module=inline" title="">Warren’s detailed economic agenda</a>. And O’Rourke still needs to prove that he can thrive in a national campaign.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he — like Biden — has at least avoided making an unnecessary early error that may bring a significant political cost.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Related:</strong> Vox’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/18/18270857/medicare-for-all-beto-orourke-2020-policies-voxcare" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Dylan Scott</a> looked at O’Rourke’s proposal for expanding Medicare, and my colleague <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/paulkrugman/status/1156557739583258624" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Paul Krugman</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/opinion/medicare-kamala-harris-democrats-2020.html?module=inline" title="">I have</a> each tried to explain why mandatory Medicare is a mistake.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In The Washington Post, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/decriminalizing-the-border-is-not-in-anyones-interest/2019/07/01/27292360-9c36-11e9-85d6-5211733f92c7_story.html?utm_term=.88a1d026cf5c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Juliette Kayyem</a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em>write<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">s, </em>“Decriminalizing the border is not in anyone’s interest<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em>”</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">If you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/david-leonhardt" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">subscribe here</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.
