<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a bathroom at a WeWork in the Gramercy Park neighborhood, Anthony (Spice) Adams was transformed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He had entered as himself, the former N.F.L. player turned social media sensation, but he emerged festooned in a maroon suit and matching fedora, a white T-shirt from his new merchandise line strategically peering through.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The character Adams was portraying, Oldhead, a dressed-to-the-sevens, know-it-all elder who dispenses unsolicited advice, is among the personas that have helped propel his online popularity. His posts on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFioa5Em-QTi1mZ4O76J7Pg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">YouTube</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/spiceadams95/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Facebook</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/spiceadams/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Instagram</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/spiceadams?s=17" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Twitter</a> served 100 million impressions in July, up 20 percent from June. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That does not count the views of the Spice Adams watermarked videos — of him dramatically exiting a car or conspicuously <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/anthony-adams-rubbing-hands" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">plotting behind a tree</a> — that fans and athletes add comment to for their own feeds, as Jets running back Le’Veon Bell did in his excitement over quarterback Sam Darnold’s return. Or the voluminous mentions of his infamous #SpiceAdamsLaugh hashtag.</p><p dir="ltr" lang="en">this is exactly how Sam showed up to practice today… 🤣 <a href="https://t.co/ncxB7HNngr">pic.twitter.com/ncxB7HNngr</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is feasible that a highly online person might not go a full day without seeing a Spice Adams meme in the wild. Adams, 39, has learned to monetize his online presence, fueling a living from the view counts, branding opportunities and sponsorships that were unthinkable during his inauspicious nine-year career as a defensive tackle for the San Francisco 49ers and the Chicago Bears. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think I’m doing my job as an entertainer if you didn’t know that I played in the N.F.L.,” Adams said. “That means I’m really putting in work right now. When I put a picture of me with a 49er uniform on, a lot of people think that’s Photoshopped.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His restroom costume makeover was for one of a series of business meetings last month in Manhattan with Samsung and other companies hoping to form a fruitful content partnership with him. Thanks to a lucrative career in pro football, Adams can afford to be picky. He won’t, for instance, create content for liquor companies, curse or do anything that he considers a bad influence on his four children.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Representatives from Samsung expressed an interest in building a basketball court as a set for a marketing activation featuring Adams as Cream E. Biggums, an oblivious rec league player who wears goggles and out-of-date gear. The Instagram account Adams <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.instagram.com/creamebiggums/?hl=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">devoted to Biggums</a> has over 271,000 followers, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/creamebiggums/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">one on Facebook</a> over <!-- -->24,000<!-- -->. Biggums is also a playable character in NBA Live 2020<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After bandying about other ideas, Adams headed to a meeting with the digital entertainment company Whistle, with whom he is a partner in a merchandise line. The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://shop.spiceadams.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">first product run</a> — a handful of designs on hoodies, T-shirts and iPhone cases <!-- -->released in <!-- -->June — made $10,000 within the first 24 hours of availability and necessitated a second run, according to Whistle. <!-- -->Adams later approved new designs before attending a production meeting for a series pilot, which Whistle will produce, where he tries out new careers like professional wrestling.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Spice Adams business has become the primary source of income for Adams, who once figured he would fight his way into the television market, as other boisterous former N.F.L. pros have done. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the N.F.L., he was known as an entertaining teammate and a down-to-earth Detroit native with a silly streak. Late in his playing career, the television personality and former Giants player Michael Strahan visited the Bears’ locker room, stopping to chat with him. It was a moment that changed how he saw himself.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He said, ‘Man, you’re a funny dude. I could see you doing some things on TV,’” Adams said. “I couldn’t see it at the time.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though an avid follower of celebrities like the Rock, Kevin Hart and Mark Wahlberg on social media, he had mostly avoided posting his own content. That changed in 2012, when, while searching for an N.F.L. job, he grew bored and made a YouTube video. The clip, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoXw17yIevI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“Stuff N.F.L. Free Agents Say</a>,” soon racked up 300,000 views. Encouraged, Adams recruited his wife, Andenika, <!-- -->and his children for cameos and to serve as shooters. He <!-- -->edited the videos in his basement. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My kids are at a point now where if they see me walk through the door with an orange suit on and a wig they’re like ‘Hey, Dad,’” Adams said. “It’s nothing to them.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By the time Adams decided to retire from the N.F.L., in March 2013, he had found the perfect vehicle for his personality — and forum for his announcement. In a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxpf0tmllBc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">video posted to (what else?) his YouTube account,</a> Adams shows up at the “ritzy” location his agent has booked for his news conference, a White Castle restaurant, where he gives his speech to an empty room. At the end of the clip, Adams begins filling out a White Castle job application.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The video went viral.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I pressed Enter on a keyboard to upload it on YouTube,” Adams said. “And then next thing I know, ESPN assignment desk was emailing me like, ‘Hey, can we put this up?’ I’m like, ‘Yeah, sure.’ And then, by the time I walked in the living room, Trey Wingo was talking about it on ESPN.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With his playing career over, Adams began working with a talent manager, Eddie Pietrucha, who had a track record of guiding athletes into traditional broadcast media. Adams got a spot as a commentator on a Chicago cable talk show, “Inside the Bears,” but Pietrucha sensed he would be more successful elsewhere.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I sat down with Spice and his wife, and I said, ‘Look, I don’t know how long it’s going to take,’” Pietrucha recalled. “‘I don’t know where the road is going to go for you because you’re such a unique, talented individual. I don’t think you belong sitting behind a desk.’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2016, Adams’s growing online profile netted him small roles <!-- -->on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/spiceadams/status/1012816946264465408?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Comedy Central’s “Detroiters”</a> and HBO’s “Ballers,” where a Whistle employee took notice of him and reached out via direct message.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“From the first time I talked to him, I could tell that he cared, he’s a family man, he wasn’t doing this for fame or for money,” said Josh Millan, a <!-- -->content <!-- -->manager at Whistle. “He was doing it to make people laugh. I think that resonates beyond anything else.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2017, he joined ABC’s “The Great British Bake Off”<em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em>American adaptation, which just concluded taping its third season in London. On a day off from the shooting schedule, Adams came to realize how pervasive the memes, not the N.F.L. playing career or television spots, had become. While walking around the city with his family, a young man ambushed him.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He ran across the street like: ‘Spice Adams! I love your videos. I love the laugh that you do!’” Adams said, referring to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC4cz496SHk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">his Spice Laugh meme</a>, which may be the internet’s second most recognizable laugh, behind <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/ESPNIndia/status/1186126301956116481" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Kawhi Leonard’s</a>. “I said, ‘Man, where you from?’ He said, ‘I’m from London.’ I’m like, ‘You’re from London and you know about the video that I shoot in my basement in Illinois?’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A block later, two women in their 20s approached, yelling, “You’re the guy from Instagram!” It happened again and again. A group from Kuwait. A couple from Leeds.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s bananas that people all over the world look at my videos,” Adams said. “It just blows my mind.”</p>
