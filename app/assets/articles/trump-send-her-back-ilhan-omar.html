<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">GREENVILLE, N.C. — President Trump road-tested his attacks on four Democratic congresswomen on Wednesday, casting them as avatars of anti-American radicalism and reiterating his call for them to leave the country, as a raucous crowd chanted, “Send her back! Send her back!”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The performance here was a preview of a slash-and-burn re-election strategy that depicts Mr. Trump as a bulwark against a “dangerous, militant hard left.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“These left-wing ideologues see our nation as a force for evil,” Mr. Trump told a packed arena. To roaring applause, he railed against what he called “hate-filled extremists who are constantly trying to tear our country down.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They don’t love our country,” he said. “I think, in some cases, they hate our country. You know what? If they don’t love it, tell them to leave it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent days, similar comments by Mr. Trump have been met with repugnance across the country. But the capacity crowd in an arena at East Carolina University seemed to savor them. After Mr. Trump reeled off several controversial comments made by one of the four congresswomen, Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, including ones that he depicted as sympathetic to Al Qaeda, the crowd started its “Send her back” chant, which could become the 2020 rejoinder to 2016’s “Lock her up!”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was the latest sign that the president’s plan for winning a second term in office involves playing to racial and nationalist themes that shock the consciences of many Americans, but which seem to delight his most ardent supporters.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump doubled down with relish on his previous calls for the congresswomen — Ms. Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/trump-twitter-squad-congress.html?module=inline" title=""> to “go back” to their countries of origin</a>, even though all but one were born in the United States and all four are citizens. It left no doubt that he was undaunted by furious condemnations of his remarks as racist, including a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/trump-tweet-house-vote.html?module=inline" title="">Tuesday vote by the House</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As his raucous audience booed repeatedly at his mentions of the women, the atmosphere had echoes of a pro-wrestling match at which the crowd thrills in its collective disdain for the villain of the moment.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wednesday night’s event was billed as a “Keep America Great” rally — a boastful variant of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”<br/></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Big Rally tonight in Greenville, North Carolina,” the president <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1151473175496146945" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">tweeted early Wednesday</a>, saying he would play up economic growth and the booming stock market in a state that has narrowly tilted right in the past two presidential contests.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many Republicans, including some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, wish he would stick to those themes, saying they think that he is overshadowing an economic success story by engaging in name-calling and divisive cultural clashes. Some feel that his relentless focus on immigration and other nationalist themes before last November’s midterm elections alienated suburban swing voters and helped enable Democrats to win the House.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But while the president did devote time to the nation’s recent economic growth, and took credit for data showing that China’s gross domestic product is growing at its slowest rate in 27 years, he was most animated when attacking his Democratic rivals, particularly Ms. Omar, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Tlaib and Ms. Pressley, who are collectively known as “the squad.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump denounced Ms. Ocasio-Cortez for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/us/politics/ocasio-cortez-cheney-detention-centers.html?module=inline" title="">branding federal migrant detention centers</a> along the southwestern border “concentration camps,” saying she had, in effect, called border agents Nazis. And he recalled the way Ms. Tlaib <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/tlaib-impeach-trump.html?module=inline" title="">had used</a> what he called a “vicious” expletive when <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/tlaib-impeach-trump.html?module=inline" title="">she vowed</a> in January that Mr. Trump would be impeached.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s not somebody that loves our country,” the president said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump also ridiculed the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, like mocking the name of Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and saying that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had “choked” in the last Democratic primary debate after Senator Kamala Harris of California challenged him on the issue of busing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Depicting the 2020 Democrats as a hapless and left-wing lot, Mr. Trump delivered what may have been his core pitch: “Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American Dream — frankly, the destruction of our country.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump also boasted about an afternoon vote in the House on a resolution to impeach him that had been introduced by Representative Al Green, Democrat of Texas. The measure, opposed by House Democratic leaders wary of a potential backlash, failed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/house-impeachment-trump.html?module=inline" title=""> 332</a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/us/politics/house-impeachment-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title=""> to 95</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We just received an overwhelming vote against impeachment, and that is the end of it,” Mr. Trump said after his arrival to the rally. “Let the Democrats now go back to work.” The vote did not preclude the possibility of future impeachment action.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump first announced the rally shortly after House Democrats set Wednesday as the date for the former special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, to testify about his report on Russian election interference. That was widely seen as an effort by the president to counterprogram that testimony, which has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/house-democrats-mueller-hearings.html?module=inline" title="">since been delayed</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During his speech on Wednesday, he only briefly mentioned the investigation, denouncing it as “a hoax,” and never mentioned Mr. Mueller.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/north-carolina?module=inline" title="">carried North Carolina in 2016</a> with 49.8 percent of the vote to Hillary Clinton’s 46.2 percent. The state also voted Republican, for Mitt Romney, in 2012, after Barack Obama won it narrowly in 2008.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In his remarks before leaving Washington, the president responded to a question about Ms. Omar, who has faced scrutiny for filing tax records with her first husband while legally married to her second.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.startribune.com/new-documents-revisit-questions-about-rep-ilhan-omar-s-marriage/511681362/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">investigation of public records and state documents by The Minnesota Star Tribune</a> last month could not substantiate a claim circulated online — and which Ms. Omar has denied — that her first husband was her brother, whom she allegedly married for immigration benefits.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump accepted the opportunity to weigh in on the subject.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There’s a lot of talk about the fact that she was married to her brother,” the president said, stating as fact something that is unproved. “I know nothing about it,” he said, adding that “I’m sure that somebody would be looking at that.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Omar, for one, stood firm in the face of the vitriol the president and his supporters had directed at her.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shortly after Mr. Trump’s rally ended, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1151656827106541569" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">she retweeted a comment by Jon Favreau</a>, a former speechwriter for President Barack Obama, saying that the crowd’s chant of “Send her back!” was “one of the most chilling and horrifying things I’ve ever seen in politics.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Above that statement, she quoted the poet Maya Angelou, writing in part: “You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I’ll rise.”</p>
