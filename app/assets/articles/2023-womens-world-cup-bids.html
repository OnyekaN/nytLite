<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">FIFA said Monday that it had received “unprecedented” interest from countries considering bids for the 2023 Women’s World Cup. But at least one of the 10 nations on FIFA’s list said hours later that it had merely requested information about the requirements to host, and had no plans to submit an official bid. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the surge of enthusiasm for serving as the stage for women’s soccer’s biggest championship was the latest sign of growing global interest and potential investment in the women’s game. FIFA’s list of potential contenders included established women’s soccer powers like Brazil, Japan and Australia and newcomers like Colombia, Argentina and South Africa.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">FIFA’s statement said Belgium had become the latest country to express interest, but a spokesman for the Royal Belgian Soccer Association suggested Monday that his federation’s inclusion had been the result of a misunderstanding. Belgium said it had, in fact, reached out to FIFA to gather details about the requirements for hosting a Women’s World Cup, according to the spokesman, Stefan van Loock, but only for informational purposes. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That information is available to all of FIFA’s member associations, but to obtain it each first must fill out a form titled “Déclaration d’intérêt” — literally a declaration of interest — that includes language saying it plans to enter the competition for the hosting rights. A country can later decline to participate, or even withdraw a formal bid, at any point.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After FIFA’s statement was released, the Belgian federation confirmed that it has no plans to bid for the 2023 tournament, van Loock said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The broad interest in hosting was encouraging for world soccer’s governing body; the most recent edition of the World Cup, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/sports/soccer/world-cup-final-uswnt.html?module=inline" title="">won by the United States</a> in July, had only <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/sports/soccer/fifa-awards-2019-womens-world-cup-to-france.html?module=inline" title="">two confirmed bidders</a> when FIFA chose France to host it in early 2015. But by the time it ended FIFA had declared it a rousing success, and FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, was pushing to add more teams in time for 2023.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The astounding success of this year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup in France made it very clear that this is the time to keep the momentum going and take concrete steps to foster the growth of women’s football,” Infantino said as he pressed behind the scenes for an expanded field of 32 teams from the current 24. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Infantino said he expected a bigger tournament to drive investment in the game. “The expansion reaches far beyond the eight additional participating teams,” he said. “It means that, from now on, dozens more member associations will organize their women’s football program knowing they have a realistic chance of qualifying.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But FIFA’s decision last month to expand the field, and to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/news/fifa-council-unanimously-approves-the-expansion-of-the-fifa-women-s-world-cup-to" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reopen the bidding process</a>, will present significant organizational hurdles for the winner. The most serious will be a compressed timeline: The final vote on the 2023 host is planned for May 2020, leaving the host nation just over three years to complete preparations, construction and planning for an event that drew more than 1.1 million fans to a 24-team event in France this summer. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Belgium would have been the only European country to express its interest in hosting, joining Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand from Asia and Oceania; Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil and Colombia from South America; and South Africa. It is unlikely that all 10 countries will follow through with formal bids, but those that do will have to hurry.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The countries that have expressed interest have until Sept. 2 to confirm their intention to bid. Completed bid books must be submitted by Dec. 13, and FIFA has said it will conduct official inspections in January and February. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States, which won this year’s championship, has said it will not bid for the 2023 World Cup, and instead will focus on the 2027 event. U.S. Soccer’s president, Carlos Cordeiro, confirmed the American federation’s intentions in an open letter to members and fans in July. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only six countries have hosted the Women’s World Cup, with China (1991 and 2007) and the United States (1999 and 2003) serving as the site of half of the previous tournaments. (Three countries — Sweden, Germany and France — have brought the event to Europe, and Canada played host in North America in 2015.) The women’s championship has never been held in South America or Africa, though Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and Japan/South Korea all have hosted the men’s version of the tournament.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">FIFA’s rules for the bidding process seem to acknowledge the difficulty an expanded field and a condensed timeline might create. The rules <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/v3y65rwec2lhfxb6faye.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">expressly permit joint bids</a>, and both Australia (with New Zealand) and South Korea (with North Korea) reportedly have explored such an arrangement, though for the moment each country is officially bidding alone. </p>
