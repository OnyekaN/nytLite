<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">AL MUKALLA, Yemen — An airstrike launched by the Houthi faction in Yemen on Thursday killed at least 40 people, including a senior Yemeni military commander, at a parade in the city of Aden, officials said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a separate attack in the city, a suicide bomber drove a truck full of explosives into a police station, killing at least 11 people, officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for that blast. At least 50 people were wounded in the two attacks in Aden, the provisional capital of the Saudi-backed forces in the country’s civil war.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The missile strike on the military parade was the bloodiest assault on the Saudi-backed forces and their territory since their other main external sponsor, the United Arab Emirates, announced <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/world/middleeast/yemen-emirates-saudi-war.html?module=inline" title="">a steep drawdown of troops</a> last month.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Emiratis had overseen security around Aden, and their withdrawal was also expected to remove portable Patriot missile batteries that they had deployed to help defend the city from such airstrikes. Although it could not be determined whether the Emirati missile defense system remained in place on Thursday, the death toll of the attack raised immediate concerns about other Houthi assaults or advances that might seek to take advantage of the Emirati withdrawal.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Saudis and Emiratis launched their joint military intervention in Yemen in the spring of 2015, vowing to roll back a takeover by the Houthis because that faction had aligned itself with and received support from Iran. Four years later, however, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-war-yemen.html?module=inline" title="">the fighting has settled into a stalemate</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Houthis remain in control of the capital, Sana. The conflict has killed tens of thousands. A partial blockade and air campaign by the Saudi-led forces has pushed Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/world/middleeast/yemen-famine-aid-donors.html?module=inline" title="">the brink of famine</a>, and United Nations aid agencies have said that as many as 14 million people — half the population — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-45964795" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">are at risk of starvation</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In background briefings last month for Western analysts, the Emiratis said they were pulling back because the war appeared unwinnable.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Now is the time to double down on the political process,” Anwar Gargash, the Emirati minister of state for foreign affairs, wrote in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/07/22/were-proud-uaes-military-role-yemen-its-time-seek-political-solution/?utm_term=.67959242cb0e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a column in The Washington Post</a> about the drawdown. He urged “the international community” to “seize the moment” and “deter any side from exploiting or undermining this opportunity.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even as they pull back from fighting the Houthis, Emirati leaders say they remain committed to a second, overlapping mission in Yemen in cooperation with American forces fighting Al Qaeda and other extremists.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Western analysts and diplomats following the fight against the Houthis say that the direct involvement of Emirati commandos and air support has accounted for virtually all of the coalition’s ground advances over the past four years.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">What’s more, analysts say, the active oversight of Emirati commanders on the ground has played an essential role in holding together a strange-bedfellows coalition of rival militias temporarily aligned against the Houthis, especially in the area around Aden.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Emiratis’ exit has thus significantly increased <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/world/middleeast/saudi-prince-yemen-emirates.html?module=inline" title="">the challenge to their Saudi partners</a>, who have said that they expect local Yemeni militias trained and equipped by the Saudi and Emirati coalition to take on a larger role in their own defense.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The air attack in Aden on Thursday may be the first significant Houthi attempt to probe for new vulnerabilities since the Emirati move.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The identity of the senior Yemeni commander who was killed, Brig. Gen. Munair al-Yafae, illustrates the fragility of the Saudi-led coalition and, for Washington, the complexity of the puzzle.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Also known as Abu al-Yamama, the general was considered one of the most formidable Yemeni commanders among the Saudi-backed forces, according to Elana DeLozier, a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy who has studied the conflict. His death is “a big deal,” she said, noting that his killing could provoke a vow of revenge by his powerful tribe, “although what form that might take is unclear.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">General al-Yafae had been seen in Yemen as closely backed by both the United Arab Emirates and the United States in their shared fight against Al Qaeda. In 2016, he led elite Yemeni forces that recaptured part of Aden and other areas from Qaeda control.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the general is also a revered leader of a Southern Yemeni separatist movement hostile to the Saudi-backed government, which is led in exile in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, by President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. In January 2018, General al-Yafae briefly turned his guns against the Saudi-backed government in Aden and lay siege to the presidential palace there. Three days of clashes between the separatist and government forces <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/30/yemens-saudi-backed-government-to-flee-from-aden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">killed at least 36 people</a> before the Emiratis managed to quell the dispute.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was not immediately clear on Thursday if there was any relation between the air attack on the military parade and the suicide bombing at the police station.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials said that the bomber had driven the truck through the police station gates during the morning lineup, in an apparent attempt to maximize the casualties. Al Qaeda and other extremist groups have claimed responsibility for previous suicide bombings in the city.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Military parades by the Saudi-backed forces have been a frequent target of Houthi missiles. In the case of the attack on Thursday, the claims of responsibility from official Houthi news outlets appeared to indicate that the attack might have been carried out with a missile or an explosive-laden drone, though further details could not be determined.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One report on a Houthi-controlled television network appeared to claim that the attack had been carried out with both a drone and a medium-range ballistic missile.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The air attack on the military parade hit just as General al-Yafae had stepped off the stage to greet a guest, Reuters reported.</p>
