I announce this at the end of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/opinion/sunday/trump-turkey-military.html?module=inline" title="">my column today.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The gift guide column originated many years ago after a Times colleague told me that she and many others struggled at the end of the year to figure out the best charities to donate to. “You should write a column with some suggestions,” she urged. I thought it was an interesting idea but — cough, cough — very un-Timesian, so I sat on it. Over time, however, it became clear that readers yearned for such practical advice, and increasingly I saw a mismatch: readers who wanted to help and didn’t know how, and heroic individuals and organizations who desperately needed resources but were unknown. So I began writing the gift guide to play matchmaker, naming a half-dozen little-known organizations working to make the world a better place.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then early this fall I had lunch with David Cohen, a former partner at Farallon Capital, and he proposed the annual prize as a way to increase the impact of these giving columns. David, a South African who was a few years behind me at Oxford University, recently established his Ezrah Charitable Trust to focus on the “neediest of the needy.” Shortly after, several others pitched in: Tess and Josh Lewis contributed $25,000 toward the 2019 awards and this was matched by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.focusingphilanthropy.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Focusing Philanthropy</a>, an organization that encourages smart donations to high-impact organizations. These donors did not seek to be named, but I thought it important to be transparent and disclose the sources of the foundational funding.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The choice of winner and runners-up is completely up to me, and the money will not go through The New York Times. For 2019, the top winner will get $100,000 and the others about $10,000 each — plus whatever readers contribute to them directly. I’m also considering ways to build on the annual prizes with initiatives to help the winning organizations beyond the prize money.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So my job now is to identify fabulous organizations. I’m not soliciting applications, for I mostly name groups that I’ve visited in the field; I’m not able to evaluate proposals. I hope to publish my column with the winner organizations in early December. So stay tuned!</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And meanwhile, you can look at my 2018 gift guide column <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/opinion/sunday/kristof-holiday-gift-guide-2018.html?module=inline" title="">here,</a> or check out earlier ones from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/02/opinion/sunday/kristof-annual-gift-guide.html?module=inline" title="">2017</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/opinion/gifts-that-make-a-difference.html?module=inline" title="">2016.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The Syria Stain on Our Honor</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/opinion/sunday/trump-turkey-military.html?module=inline" title="">My Sunday column</a> begins with a contrast: President Obama’s 2014 work with the Kurds to avert a genocide against the Yazidi people in Syria, versus Trump’s betrayal of the Kurds to unleash war, mayhem and possibly ethnic cleansing. I’ve reported on that border and feel sick about what is unfolding, and it seems to me not only an unraveling of recent years of Middle East policy but a corrosion of 75 years of the post-war American-led international order. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/opinion/sunday/trump-turkey-military.html?module=inline" title="">Please read.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The Crony Capitalism Is Ours</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When I was a reporter based in Asia, American officials would regularly come and denounce the local “crony capitalism,” including the way government officials rewarded themselves. Now I feel we owe those countries an apology: President Trump’s decision to hold the G7 meeting at one of his own properties achieves a scale of crony capitalism that even Indonesia could never attain. The idea that he will force foreign governments and American officials to stay at his property and pay his company to do business is unfathomably corrupt.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The Worst Place To Be Female?</strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">South Sudan has long been one of the world’s worst places to be female. A girl is more likely to die in childbirth there than to graduate from high school, and sexual violence is widespread. I’ve interviewed so many women and girls in recent years with bloodcurdling stories of murder, rape and torture at the hands of the Army or various militias. In the marshes in the center of the country, I found women who fled with their babies into the water whenever soldiers approached, and then stood neck deep for hours at a time, because they said it was better to risk the crocodiles than the troops. Now <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.refugeesinternational.org/reports/2019/10/15/still-danger-women-girls-face-sexual-violence-south-sudan-peace-deal?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiT0dVMk56TmlNMk5oWVRWbSIsInQiOiJJZ24yaFY3UzBqUnhrQVdRR09RUFBTK2lcL0EyTXhpZ3FqVWNGNjlnanBDR3Y3R1c4RTYwVlExK3NqamFIbWRDQlQ0T09xQWx5cXJ2M2RyTVFoQVFMajJLWk15aGdaVWtvVVlHT0V5U1lTemRJUGxBQUJucTBJU0VnYW8wOWRjb1oifQ%3D%3D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a new report</a> from Refugees International says that sexual violence is continuing apace, despite a peace deal, and calls for urgent action to address it. I hope governments around the world put pressure on South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, to rectify these outrages.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I hope governments around the world put pressure on South Sudan’s president, Salva Kiir, to rectify these outrages.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/opinion/sunday/trump-turkey-military.html?module=inline" title="">And here’s my column about what Trump has unleashed in Syria.</a></p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
