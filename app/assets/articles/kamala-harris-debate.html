<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Good morning.</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">(Want to get California Today by email? </em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today?module=inline"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today" title="">Here’s the sign-up</a></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.)</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Here’s a closer look at the performance of the senator by Jennifer Medina, who is covering the 2020 campaign:</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During her first presidential debate, Senator Kamala Harris was on offense. Last night, now one of the Democratic field’s front-runners, she was forced to take on a defensive stance.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Following a breakthrough performance in last month’s Democratic debate, Ms. Harris has emerged as one of the party’s most closely watched candidates. She and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in particular are seen as chief rivals after a highly personal dispute over segregation and school busing in that debate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The visibility that followed gave Ms. Harris a significant boost in fund-raising and elevated her standing in polls of the primary field. The exchange also stirred many questions about Mr. Biden’s legislative history on issues concerning racial equality.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And so <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/democratic-presidential-debate-recap.html?module=inline" title="">fireworks in the rematch</a> seemed inevitable.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As Ms. Harris took to the stage Wednesday, Mr. Biden quipped, “Go easy on me, kid.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden went after Ms. Harris by pointing out that San Francisco and Los Angeles have two of the most segregated school systems in the country. He also accused Ms. Harris of using “double-talk” on health care proposals, to which Ms. Harris retorted: “They’re probably confused because they’ve not read it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-prisoners-tulsi-gabbard.html?module=inline" title="">most searing critique</a> of Ms. Harris’s time as attorney general came from Representative Tulsi Gabbard.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana,” Ms. Gabbard said of Ms. Harris. Then she went further, saying Ms. Harris owed an apology to “people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the debate ended, Ms. Harris sought to dismiss the criticism, spinning it instead into a strength.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Obviously I’m a top-tier candidate and so I did expect that I’d be on the stage and take some hits tonight,” she said in an interview with Anderson Cooper. (She<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/31/us/elections/debate-speaking-time.html?module=inline" title=""> spoke more than </a>any other candidate except Mr. Biden.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">We</strong> <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">want to hear from you: </strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Now that the state’s primary election has been moved up to March, California will have a far more significant role in choosing the Democratic nominee than it has in the past. Ms. Harris is counting on significant support here. What did you think of last night’s debate? How do you view Ms. Harris’s record as attorney general? Are you more likely to vote for the California senator than any other candidate?</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">• Looking for more details about some of the key scuffles in last night’s Democratic debate?

Small wildfires erupted in the canyons on either side of town every year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’ve been here so long, it didn’t even faze me,” Ms. Fisher said, as she recalled the day the deadliest fire in California’s history ripped through her town.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Fisher would soon become one of thousands of people who were trapped in their cars trying to escape the area, each sealed in his or her own saga of agony, terror, courage or despair. She and others kept trying to scurry away from the fire only to discover that the blaze was ahead of them, behind them, alongside them, all around.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Within two hours of the first spot fires being reported near Ms. Fisher’s house, others leapfrogged from one end of Paradise to the other. It was unintelligible. As one man said, “I thought that the only part of Paradise that was on fire was the part of Paradise we were looking at.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As Ms. Fisher tried to escape, one thing after another went wrong. She couldn’t reach her sister. She was trapped behind a wall of cars. Then something started beeping: the low-fuel alert. She was almost out of gas, though it ultimately wouldn’t matter. Moments later, her car caught fire.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Read more about Ms. Fisher’s efforts to escape, along with others, in this week’s issue of The New York Times Magazine.
