<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The timing certainly seemed suspicious. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One day last month, Jerry Foxhoven, 66, the director of Iowa’s Department of Human Services, sent an email celebrating the rapper Tupac Shakur to all 4,300 agency employees. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A few days later, he was ordered to resign. <!-- -->Some of his former employees thought the email was to blame. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But, in a phone interview, Mr. Foxhoven said his frequent quoting of Tupac at work — detailed in 350 pages of internal emails first obtained <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.apnews.com/c7ae931fae0f4bc1a0fe3386e4b5bc38" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">by The Associated Press</a> — was simply intended to raise morale at the troubled agency. He did not believe it led to his removal.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think it’s a coincidence,” Mr. Foxhoven said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He explained that the office of Gov. Kim Reynolds had requested a meeting with him days before he sent the office-wide email June 14. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In that message, Mr. Foxhoven reminded employees that Father’s Day was coming up and that it coincided with Tupac’s birthday, June 16. He included what he said was “an inspirational quote”: “Pay no mind to those who talk behind your back; it simply means that you are two steps <!-- -->ahead<!-- -->.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The emails obtained by The A.P., and later by The New York Times, show that Mr. Foxhoven, who described himself as “a 66-year-old white guy,” often referred to Tupac in messages, and even held “Tupac Fridays” in the office. A birthday party featured cookies decorated with the phrase “Thug Life.” He also quoted other celebrities in holiday-themed messages.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The emails show that many employees responded positively. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I love your 2Pac messages,” one manager wrote June 14. “And the fact that you still send them (despite the haters) makes me appreciate them even more.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The next Monday, Mr. Foxhoven said, he met with Ms. Reynolds’s chief of staff and was told that the governor wanted to take the agency in a different direction. He agreed to resign. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Reynolds, a Republican, had praised Mr. Foxhoven as a “compassionate, thoughtful leader” when she <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://governor.iowa.gov/2017/06/gov-reynolds-appoints-jerry-foxhoven-as-director-of-iowa-department-of-human-services" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">appointed him</a> in June 2017. He had previously worked as a lawyer, professor and children’s rights advocate. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said he had been brought in to “right the ship” and raise morale during a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.iowapublicradio.org/post/dhss-foxhoven-morale-not-good-among-child-abuse-investigators" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">period of turmoil</a> at the agency, including fallout from the deaths of two teenagers who had been adopted out of foster care and major problems with the Medicaid system.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We made a lot of progress,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added that many directors do not serve long terms, and that his two-year tenure meant that he had outlasted many of his predecessors.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Reynolds had served as lieutenant governor under Terry Branstad, who was nominated as ambassador to China in December 2016. She assumed the governor’s office in 2017 and won an election for the seat the next year. Mr. Foxhoven said he believed she was simply filling posts with “more political people.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her office did not return calls on Wednesday. Last month, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2019/06/24/iowa-kim-reynolds-office-no-records-agency-leaders-exit-jerry-foxhoven-dhs-medicaid-resignation/1546718001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">she told reporters</a> that “a lot of factors” had gone into the decision to remove Mr. Foxhoven, but would not say whether the move was tied to disciplinary action. Gerd W. Clabaugh, the director of the Department of Public Health, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.rcreader.com/news-releases/gov-kim-reynolds-appoints-gerd-w-clabaugh-interim-director-department-human-services" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">was appointed</a> as interim director of human services.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Foxhoven said his quoting of Tupac and his holiday messages were meant to “add a little levity and humanness” to the office. He added that he had been a Tupac fan since the ’90s. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I would say Tupac is by far my favorite, second would be Snoop Dogg,” he said, adding that he also likes jazz and rock. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tupac, who was 25 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/arts/tupac-shakur-25-rap-performer-who-personified-violence-dies.html?module=inline" title="">when he was gunned down</a> in Las Vegas in 1996, could be a controversial figure; critics said he glorified gang life. But he is widely seen as one of the greatest rappers ever, praised for his lyricism and the forthright way he addressed pressing social issues.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Foxhoven said that he appreciated the socially conscious messages in Tupac’s work, and that he had shared only quotations that fit with the agency’s mission.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He referred to a poem Tupac wrote called “The Rose That Grew From Concrete.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I think the message that he had was very much in tune with what we say about helping families and children in today’s world,” he said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Mark Walker contributed reporting from Washington. </em></p>
