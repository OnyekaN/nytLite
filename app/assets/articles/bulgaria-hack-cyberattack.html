<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An investigation into the theft of the personal information of nearly every adult in Bulgaria led to the arrest of a 20-year-old computer programmer, the police announced Wednesday, in connection with a breach that underscores the vulnerability of vast troves of digitized information.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The authorities acknowledged that Bulgaria’s national tax agency was hacked after a news outlet received an email on Monday with a taunt and a claim of responsibility. The names, addresses, incomes and social security information of as many as five million Bulgarians and foreign residents — in a country of only seven million — had been taken.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The state of your cybersecurity is a parody,” the self-proclaimed hacker <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2019/07/15/3938643_anonimen_meil_razprostrani_lichni_danni_za_milioni/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">emailed</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though the police cautioned that the investigation was in its early stages, some officials suggested that Russia might have been behind the attack, as retaliation for the country’s recent purchase of American-made fighter jets. A lawyer for the suspect denied he played any role in the breach.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Regardless of who perpetrated the hack, experts said the breach highlighted the ever-growing danger faced by both governments and their citizens in an increasingly digitized world.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The breach was the largest theft of personal data ever reported in the Balkans — Bulgaria’s prime minister convened an emergency meeting of the nation’s security agencies — and just the latest in a series of attacks that have exposed how much data remains insecure online despite a series of recent high-profile thefts.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last year, the United States <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/us/politics/north-korea-sony-hack-wannacry-indictment.html?module=inline" title="">accused North Korean hackers</a> of crippling Britain’s health care system and stealing millions from Bangladesh, as part of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/us/politics/north-korea-sony-hack-wannacry-indictment.html?module=inline" title="">a yearslong campaign </a>to place ransomware on computers around the world. A few years earlier, American officials said that hackers based in China <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/world/asia/chinese-hackers-pursue-key-data-on-us-workers.html?module=inline" title="">broke into the computer networks </a>of a United States government agency, exposing the personal information of more than 21.5 million people.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Corporations have suffered even larger breaches. Thieves stole more than 140 million Social Security numbers <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/business/equifax-breach.html?module=inline" title="">from the credit agency Equifax</a>, hackers exposed the data of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/business/marriott-data-breach.html?module=inline" title="">up to 500 million Mariott International guests</a>, and attacks on the tech giant Yahoo <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/technology/yahoo-hack.html?module=inline" title="">compromised more than 1 billion user accounts</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, many governments have concentrated their attention on areas deemed “critical infrastructure” — such as energy and defense networks — a category that does not always include vast repositories of personal data.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since becoming a member of NATO in 2004, Bulgaria has steadily worked to bolster its cyberdefenses, and in June it became a member of a NATO program, the Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, meant to help member nations improve their cybersecurity capabilities.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Dr. Vesselin Bontchev, an assistant professor at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and a cybersecurity expert, said that the government — like many others — needed to broaden its view of what is vital to national security.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many government officials, he said, “were worried mostly about the usual that gets discussed in the Western press — hybrid warfare, Russian disinformation and meddling, attacks against the critical infrastructure — that sort of thing.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But those were “largely theoretical problems,” he said. “I didn’t see anyone being particularly worried about viruses, ransomware, data breaches, phishing and other everyday cybersecurity problems. Although, arguably, the National Revenue Agency is critical infrastructure.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The breach of the National Revenue Agency, Bulgaria’s tax authority, is believed to have occurred in June and may have continued for some time. It was not made public until Monday, after news outlets around the country received an email — which came from a Russian address — claiming responsibility for the attack.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But like with so many cyberattacks, taking an inventory of the damage was a simpler task than assigning blame and understanding the broader implications.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As residents of one of the European Union’s newest and poorest member states wrestled with how the breach might affect their lives — with many fearing identity theft, and scores going to social media to mock their government — public officials offered a variety of theories about who might have been responsible.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most attacks of this nature in Eastern and Central Europe are financially motivated, the tactic of criminal gangs looking to sell the information or use it for blackmail. David Balson, the director of intelligence at Ripjar, a security company in Britain, said it was becoming easier and easier to conduct this type of attack, with open-source tools readily available online.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Personal data, including job titles and their associated income, would be of interest to all kinds of actors. “There’s a lot of incentive to go after this data, regardless of the barriers to entry,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The value of this kind of data could range from $10 to a few hundred per identity, he said. “You’re looking at a hack that could be worth as much as $200 million,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because the suspect worked for a cybersecurity firm, there was some speculation that the hack might have been a so-called “white hat” attack, perpetrated to expose vulnerabilities in the government’s computer networks and create public pressure to fix it. But the lawyer for the suspect rejected that theory, saying the suspect wasn’t involved at all in the attack.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other government officials suggested that the country might have been targeted by Russia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mladen Marinov, the interior minister, said that the authorities had to remember the political context in which the attack took place, an apparent reference to Bulgaria’s relations with Russia and the West. This spring, Bulgaria finalized the details of its largest-ever foreign military acquisition since the end of Communist rule in 1989, agreeing to spend nearly <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2019/07/10/world/europe/10reuters-bulgaria-usa-jets.html?module=inline" title="">$1.3 billion to buy eight F-16<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>fighter jets</a> from the United States.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Organized criminal groups involved in cyberattacks usually seek financial profits, but here political motives are possible,” Mr. Marinov said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boyko Borisov called an emergency meeting of the nation’s security agencies to discuss the ramifications of the attack. He told reporters that the incident showed that there were some “brilliant minds” working in the country’s tech sector, many of whom should be working for the state.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It seems like education is getting better and better, especially in the I.T. field,” he said on Wednesday. “We have some true wizards.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Maya Alexandrova, a senior associate at a law firm in Sofia specializing in cybersecurity, said Bulgaria had introduced a legal framework for dealing with cybersecurity issues only last year. Private companies, she said, have been working to enhance their defenses.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Unfortunately I could not say the same thing for the government authorities,” she said. The state authorities, she said, “are not keeping up.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The case could also test the European Union’s ability to help a member nation, in both its investigation and any possible retaliation. The European Council recently passed its first legal framework that would allow the bloc to sanction people or networks involved in cyberattacks.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But first, blame must be assigned, which can be difficult even outside the murky world of cyberattacks, in which the lines can be blurred between criminals, state-sponsored groups and intelligence agencies.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yavor Kolev, the head of the Bulgarian police’s cybersecurity unit, said that it was too early in the investigation to draw any firm conclusions. But he said that they had uncovered evidence that “suggests that the suspect is connected to the crime.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The suspect, identified by his lawyer as Kristiyan Boikov, worked for the TAD Group, a private cybersecurity firm.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Kolev said that Mr. Boikov had engaged in criminal activity in the past. “In his life, he has been on both sides,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">However, Mr. Boikov’s lawyer, Georgi Stefanov, said that his name had been given to the police by a competing cybersecurity company in an attempt to frame his client.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Kristiyan in an expert in his field,” Mr. Stefanov told reporters in Sofia. He added that if he wanted to hack the tax authority’s database, the Bulgarian police would never have found a trace.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, the same day Mr. Boikov was taken into custody, Bulgarian news outlets received another email from the alleged hacker. The writer, who claimed to be a Russian citizen married to Bulgarian woman, taunted officials, saying the government will never find him. “They will just cover up the real truth,” he wrote.<br/></p>
