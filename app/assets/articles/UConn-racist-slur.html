<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Two white students at the University of Connecticut were arrested by the campus police on Monday night, 10 days after they were captured on video repeatedly shouting a racist slur outside student apartments, the university said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The students, Jarred Karal and Ryan Mucaj, both 21, were charged with ridicule on account of creed, religion, color, denomination, nationality or race. Their arrests came after the widely shared video drew outrage and calls by students for the administration to take action.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The misdemeanor carries a maximum penalty of 30 days in jail and a fine of up to $50, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/current/pub/chap_939.htm#sec_53-37" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to state law</a>. The two were released on personal recognizance and are scheduled to appear in Rockville Superior Court on Oct. 30. Efforts to reach the students<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Monday and Tuesday were not successful, and it was unclear whether they had retained lawyers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The video, which was widely shared on social media, was taken by a student in Charter Oak Apartments and showed three men walking in the apartments’ parking lot on Oct. 11. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only two of the men were arrested after the police determined that the third person had not participated in the behavior, Stephanie Reitz, a university spokeswoman, said in a statement. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The investigation by the UConn Police Department found that the men were playing a game in which they yelled vulgar words. As they walked through the parking lot, witnesses heard two of the men switch to shouting a racial epithet, the police said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Mucaj later told a campus police officer that after a night of drinking he did not remember saying the slur, “even as a game,” affidavits released on Tuesday said. Mr. Karal said in a statement to the police that “I don’t believe that we had been shouting loud enough for other people to hear us,” according to the affidavits.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It was not our intent to broadcast what was said to any one person, we were just being immature,” he said, according to the affidavits.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The arrests came on the same day that a rally was held on campus demanding action from school administrators, Areon Mangan, a student who helped organize the event on behalf of the UConn African American Cultural Center, said in an interview on Monday night. During the gathering, which drew more than 100 people, student activists chanted, “It’s more than just a word,” she added. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Mangan said that black students on campus were hurt, scared and angry after the episode, and that the administration was slow in responding to it. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a statement on Monday night, Thomas Katsouleas, the president of the university, said, “It is supportive of our core values to pursue accountability, through due process, for an egregious assault on our community that has caused considerable harm.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m grateful for the university’s collective effort in responding to this incident,” he continued, “especially the hard work of the UConn Police Department, which has been investigating the case since it was reported.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Katsouleas, who addressed the crowd at the student rally with a bullhorn, said he was there “to listen and to learn,” Ms. Mangan said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Earlier that day, The Daily Campus, a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://dailycampus.com/stories/2019/10/21/the-university-of-connecticut-naacp-chapter-denounces-uconn-storrs-racism-amp-bigotry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">student newspaper</a>, published an open letter from UConn’s chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to administration and faculty condemning what it said was the university’s lack of action and listing several demands.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Black students at this university account for about 7 percent of the student population,” the letter said. “We have a collective responsibility to ensure their dignity, safety, and rights as students of UConn are protected.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The episode on Oct. 11 was not isolated, the N.A.A.C.P. chapter said. A day after the video went viral, another student made allegations against two fraternity members who referred to her using a racial slur and belittled her into leaving their fraternity party.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s pretty disappointing that our university took so long,” Ms. Mangan said. “It seems like our voices, needs and concerns were not taken seriously until we had to cause a commotion.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Tuesday, Ms. Reitz said that she was not permitted by privacy laws to discuss individual cases, but that generally if the university finds a student violated the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://nam01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.uconn.edu%2Fthe-student-code-pdf%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cstephanie.reitz%40uconn.edu%7Ca5849bf2ff044acef62408d756e7a08f%7C17f1a87e2a254eaab9df9d439034b080%7C0%7C0%7C637073425134523789&amp;sdata=82lplCW38CScJGQ0%2BpXicpZ66vqrt4dUJHZd8L5VDG4%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Code of Conduct</a>, the person is given an opportunity to appeal. “If the finding is upheld, the student could be subject to discipline ranging from probation to suspension or dismissal,” she said.</p>
