<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For<!-- --> Tilman Fertitta, the billionaire restaurant magnate, host of the CNBC television show “Billion Dollar Buyer” and owner of the N.B.A.’s Houston Rockets, silence is unusual.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet, he has been mostly silent publicly since his Oct. 4 social media rebuke of Daryl Morey, his basketball team’s general manager, after Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong with a post on Twitter. With his team getting set to play preseason games in Japan, Fertitta quickly distanced himself — not from the authoritarian Chinese government, but from his widely admired executive. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His statement was simple: <!-- -->Morey had gone rogue.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Listen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization,” Fertitta wrote.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then the mixed messages began. Fertitta told ESPN all was well with Morey and him, but around the same time, he began liking <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/Rockets_Insider/status/1180927581207629825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">posts on Instagram</a> supportive of Morey’s firing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And then he went quiet.<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In his first public comments since the interview with ESPN, Fertitta, whose team opens the season on Thursday night against Milwaukee, agreed to provide written answers to questions through a spokeswoman. He said he “never considered firing or punishing Daryl” in the wake of Morey’s Twitter post. Fertitta also said that he needed to initially distance the Rockets from Morey because, “I felt it was important to make the distinction between Daryl speaking as a private citizen and Daryl as a representative of the Houston Rockets.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He added, “We have never commented on another country’s foreign policy.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then it was back to silence. Fertitta declined to answer several follow-up questions, including whether he wished he had handled anything differently since Morey’s post. The Rockets said Morey was not available for comment.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Having the Rockets at the center of what has become a contentious<!-- --> relationship<!-- --> between the N.B.A. and the Chinese government has presented Fertitta with the most significant challenge of his two-year tenure leading one of the N.B.A.’s top franchises — well beyond the challenge of trying to bring the city a third championship. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Rockets were the team of Yao Ming, the Hall of Fame center and one of the most popular athletes in China. Morey’s tweet, in which he shared an image that said “Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong” has — for now — mostly collapsed the partnership between the N.B.A. and China, a country in which the league has spent decades making inroads to expand its business. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Rockets lost all team sponsorships with Chinese companies, including the apparel company Li-Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. Chinese broadcast networks have scaled back coverage of the league, and, after N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver said that he refused a demand from the Chinese government to have the Rockets fire Morey, China Central Television, the state-run network, broadcast an editorial <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/sports/basketball/nba-china-adam-silver-retribution.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fsopan-deb&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">threatening “retribution”</a> against Silver. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Domestically, the reaction was also heated, but for a different reason. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The N.B.A. faced widespread criticism from politicians across parties for not more strongly standing behind Morey in its initial statement on Oct. 6, which described as “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/05/sports/basketball/houston-rockets-sale-tilman-fertitta.html?module=inline" title="">regrettable</a>” the offense that many Chinese people felt because of Morey’s tweet. <!-- -->Other basketball figures received backlash as well. James Harden, a star on the Rockets, <!-- -->was criticized for saying<!-- -->: “We apologize. You know, we love China,” at a practice in Tokyo, where the Rockets played a preseason game. Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, was mocked by President Trump for declining to comment on the China tensions. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">LeBron James, one of the most popular athletes in the world, was castigated for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/sports/basketball/lebron-james-china.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fscott-cacciola&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">appearing to blame</a> Morey for the conflict with China, saying that the general manager “wasn’t educated on the situation at hand.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican of Texas, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/10/16/ted-cruz-lebron-james-nba-china-hong-kong/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said that for James</a> “kissing up to Chinese communists and tyrants and apologizing for murderers, that’s not a good look.” Separately, Cruz <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/09/nba-should-not-be-an-arm-of-chinese-censorship-says-sen-ted-cruz.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">told CNBC</a>: “We’ve seen the N.B.A. falling all over itself to back track, and everyone understands why. There’s big money in China.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fertitta, despite having rushed to distance himself from Morey’s comments, escaped much of the glare.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cruz did not mention Fertitta but did invite Silver to testify before a <!-- -->congressional subcommittee<!-- --> on the constitution that he chairs. Senator John Cornyn, also a Republican of Texas, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn/status/1181039396105011201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">slammed</a> the N.B.A., without naming <!-- -->the Rockets’ owner<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The attention from Texas politicians is not surprising, given that the N.B.A. has three franchises in the state. But Fertitta has also donated about $45,700 to political action committees associated with Cornyn and $35,500 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the maximum allowed in 2019. Fertitta also donated to Cruz’s Senate re-election campaign last year. A spokeswoman for Cruz declined to comment, and a spokesman for Cornyn did not respond to an <!-- -->email.<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fertitta’s political activity also has included business-minded pragmatism. He recently led an unsuccessful <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2018/06/20/houston-among-3-finalists-for-2020-democratic.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">campaign for Houston</a> to host the 2020 Democratic National Convention, which likely would have been a financial boost for Fertitta’s Houston-based enterprises. Milwaukee was chosen instead.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These efforts have helped make him a friend of the political class rather than the target of its criticism.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fertitta made much of his fortune in the restaurant and hospitality business. His company, Fertitta Entertainment, owns and operates the company Landry’s Inc., which oversees hundreds of restaurants including Atlantic Grill, Dos Caminos and Joe’s Crab Shack. Recently, Fertitta purchased the Del Frisco’s chain of grilles and steakhouses. Americans who do not follow basketball may know him from his CNBC show, in which he travels the United States visiting small businesses.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The restaurateur also owns several Golden Nugget casinos in the United States. Gambling is the Fertitta family business: His cousins, Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, own the Las-Vegas based chain Station Casinos. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Associates describe Fertitta as jovial, versatile, inquisitive — and usually outspoken.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He kind of lets you know where he stands,” said Sylvester Turner, the Democratic mayor of Houston and a longtime friend of Fertitta’s. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.uhsystem.edu/board-of-regents/board-members/taaffe/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Peter K. Taaffe</a>, a lawyer with the Houston-based Buzbee Law Firm, said Fertitta has “a good ability to give his input when it’s important.” Taaffe and Fertitta are on the Board of Regents for the University of Houston system; <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.uhsystem.edu/board-of-regents/board-members/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Fertitta is board chairman.</a> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Taaffe said the sensitivities regarding China might have been too risky for Fertitta’s typical approach.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Those types of relations are incredibly delicate for the most professional diplomats and politicians,” Taaffe said. “My only observation is that I’m not surprised that Tilman has handled it in — I think — an appropriate way.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Turner, the Houston mayor, who has known Fertitta for at least 20 years, also defended Fertitta, saying that he has had little choice besides thinking carefully before speaking further. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There are a lot of dynamics involved,” Turner said. “In a situation like that, I think it is prudent to be more patient and not just be quick to comment.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Fertitta had been willing to speak on politics, particularly domestic issues, before — and without distancing the Rockets from his views. Just weeks before Morey shared the Hong Kong image, Fertitta told Yahoo that socialism “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tilman-fertitta-socialism-scares-the-hell-out-of-me-163128711.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">scares the hell out of me</a>.” In 2017, he told CNBC that President Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/07/billionaire-restaurateur-why-i-think-trump-has-done-a-great-job.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">was doing a “great job.”</a> That same year, he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/07/billionaire-restaurateur-regulation-ups-menu-prices-in-san-francisco.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">criticized</a> San Francisco for requiring some businesses to set aside money for employee health insurance, raising costs for his restaurants in the city. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Soon after buying the Rockets, which he did in 2017 for a then-record $2.2 billion, Fertitta weighed in on another debate about free speech and athletes stemming from football players who were kneeling at games during the national anthem — much to the ire of President Trump, Cruz and many Republicans.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The N.B.A. has a rule, and the rule is you stand for the national anthem, O.K.?” Fertitta <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/noahkirsch/2017/10/11/interview-billionaire-tilman-fertitta-talks-houston-rockets-national-anthem-protests/#3ba7c9c93f30" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">told Forbes</a>. “And the N.B.A. has told us these are the rules, and so we’re going to follow the rules at the Houston Rockets.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked whether he would be comfortable with his employees publicly voicing their political views in the future, Fertitta declined to comment.</p>
