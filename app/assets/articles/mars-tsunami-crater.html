On a world believed to have lacked Earthlike plate tectonics, any tsunamis were probably triggered by a meteor slamming into a huge body of water.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The area where the northern ocean was thought to exist also contains what are called <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://redplanet.asu.edu/?p=23313" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">thumbprint terrains</a>, found on the landward side of those suspected ancient shorelines. These terrains may have been etched by the chaotic and violent flow of water in the aftermath of the mega-tsunamis. But which craters were tied to the impacts responsible for those mega-tsunamis was long a mystery.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2017, a team led by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://planeto.geol.u-psud.fr/spip.php?article102" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">François Costard</a>, a planetary geomorphologist at the French National Center for Scientific Research, used computer modeling to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JE005230" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reproduce</a> the mega-tsunamis most likely to have created those thumbprint terrains. That narrowed it down to a handful of impact craters.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the new paper, Dr. Costard and his colleagues examined these candidate craters and ultimately zeroed in on Lomonosov, <!-- -->which was likely forged by a 9-by-12 mile meteor in just the right place at just the right time<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Its rim is also roughly the same height as the estimated depth of the ocean. Crucially, it physically resembles Earth’s marine craters, suggesting — if not definitively demonstrating — that it was created in a shallow ocean.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another clue is the hole in the crater’s southern section. The plains there are tilted up toward the southern highlands. It’s possible that the ocean, displaced by the impact, would have rushed back most aggressively from this direction, bursting through the crater’s southern rim.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.psi.edu/about/staffpage/alexis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Alexis Rodriguez</a>, a Mars geomorphologist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., and co-author of the new study, said the remnants of this Martian ocean may be a good target in the search for evidence of life on the <!-- -->red p<!-- -->lanet.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The ocean may have been fed by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-39632-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">catastrophic floods</a> from underground caches of liquid water. If so, sediments in the north “may be a window into the subsurface habitability of Mars,” Dr. Rodriguez said. If they contain geochemical signatures of ancient microbiology, then the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2018/july/liquid-water-found-beneath-the-surface-of-mars.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwj_XpBRCCARIsAItJiuSAFMvFxAmsQpn5RctHU_bFRsdSOmBrSq1Ug7K2wMozMtqBTWZSszQaAoJ-EALw_wcB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">liquid aquifers</a> thought to exist beneath Mars’ surface may still be reservoirs for life today.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Of course, all this depends on whether a northern ocean actually existed — a conclusion challenged by studies of the <!-- -->red p<!-- -->lanet’s ancient climate. Dr. Rodriguez calls this one of the “core paradoxes” of Martian planetary science.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://meas.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/pkbyrne/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Paul Byrne</a>, a planetary geologist at North Carolina State University who was not involved with the study, agreed: “It’s fair to say that we don’t yet fully understand the history of Mars’s climate, and certainly, the climate models we use will continue to be improved.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite compelling geological <!-- -->evidence<!-- -->, he said, scientists still don’t have unambiguous proof of a northern ocean. “So the climate models might not be wrong,” he added — but more data is needed to say one way or the other.</p>
