Cummings, the<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Maryland Democrat, and his hometown of Baltimore on Friday, after an attempted break in at the congressman’s home.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Baltimore Police are investigating a burglary <!-- -->at <!-- -->Mr. Cummings’s home last weekend, which occurred hours before Mr. Trump began <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1155073964634517505?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">assailing</a> Mr. Cummings’s congressional district as a rat-infested “mess.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I was notified of the intrusion by my security system, and I scared the intruder away by yelling before the person gained entry into the residential portion of the house,” Mr. Cummings, 68, said in a statement on Friday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump acknowledged the attempted break-in on Friday morning. “Really bad news!” he wrote on Twitter. “The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad!”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The intruder had entered the first-floor hallway of Mr. Cummings’s building at about 3:40 a.m. on Saturday, but did not get into any of the living areas, according to a police report. The intruder, who appeared to be in his 40s, fled on a bicycle when he was confronted by a resident who yelled at him, an officer wrote in the report. No property was stolen and there were no signs of forced entry.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cummings, who is serving his 13th term in the House, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2012/06/25/gJQAkV3l2V_story.html?_=ddid-5-1564698480&amp;utm_term=.3deebfad0ee2&amp;noredirect=on" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">owns</a> a three-story brick row home in West Baltimore. A tenant lives on the third floor of the property and Mr. Cummings has reported earning between $5,001 and $15,000 in rental income from the property for each year since 2007, according to financial disclosures filed with the House of Representatives.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> The burglary was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2019/08/01/break-in-reported-at-rep-elijah-cummings-house/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">first reported by WJZ</a>, a CBS affiliate in Baltimore.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cummings has been a vocal critic of the treatment of children held in migrant detention centers. Less than three hours after the reported burglary occurred, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that Mr. Cummings’s “Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous” than conditions at the United States border with Mexico. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump’s comments echoed a recent segment on “Fox &amp; Friends” showing piles of trash in a West Baltimore neighborhood. His comments about crime and mismanagement in the majority-black city led some to accuse Mr. Trump of racism. He responded by calling Mr. Cummings, who has been hailed as a civil rights icon, “racist.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cummings’s home sits on the edge of the Druid Heights neighborhood of West Baltimore. In response to Mr. Trump’s criticism, Mr. Cummings has vowed to continue working for his constituents. “Mr. President, I go home to my district daily,” he said.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>“Each morning, I wake up, and I go and fight for my neighbors.”</p>
