He said he had schizophrenia and was off his medication. By the time the police arrived, Mr. Timpa was highly agitated and had been handcuffed by security guards.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The video footage shows how responding officers restrained Mr. Timpa as he pleaded for them to let him go. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You’re going to kill me,” he shouted repeatedly. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The footage, which the news organizations had sought, is part of a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4062049/Original-Complaint-Filed-2016.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">lawsuit</a> filed by Mr. Timpa’s family alleging that the police used excessive force. A federal judge ruled in favor of a motion by the media organizations to release the records on Monday. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The officers pinned Mr. Timpa facedown on a patch of grass, the video shows, for more than 13 minutes. They joked and laughed, with one officer suggesting a “Greek Oaks cocktail,” a reference to a local psychiatric facility. Their laughter continued after he stopped moving or making any sounds. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Back to school! Come on, wake up!” one officer quipped as they tried to rouse him. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After Mr. Timpa was loaded into an ambulance, the officers grew concerned about whether he was breathing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I hope I didn’t kill him,” one officer says, as his colleagues continue to laugh. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The paramedics were unable to revive Mr. Timpa. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6226349-SWIFS-Investigative-Narrative.html#document/p7/a515249" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">An autopsy</a> classified his death as a homicide, a victim of sudden cardiac death due to “the toxic effects of cocaine and the stress associated with physical restraint.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The footage graphically depicts the needless death of an unarmed young man,” Geoff Henley, a lawyer for Mr. Timpa’s family, said in a statement on Thursday. “What is worse, some of the officers seemed more interested in sophomoric gallows humor than ensuring that they were keeping Tony alive.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The news organizations first reported on Mr. Timpa’s death in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/investigations/2017/09/28/police-responded-911-call-help-died-happened-tony-timpa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a 2017 investigation</a> that showed that the police refused to say how he died. The city and county had fought to prevent the release of records related to Mr. Timpa’s death, arguing it would interfere with an open criminal case, the organizations reported. Afterward, officials said the records could not be released because a case against three of the police officers never went to trial. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sgt. Kevin Mansell and officers Danny Vasquez and Dustin Dillard were indicted in 2017 by a grand jury on charges of misdemeanor deadly conduct. But the charges were dismissed in March by the Dallas County district attorney, John Creuzot. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.dallascounty.org/Assets/uploads/docs/district-attorney/press-release/Charges-of-Misdemeanor-Deadly-Conduct-Dismissed-Against-Three-Dallas-Police-Officers-20180318.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">In a statement</a> then, Mr. Creuzot said that three medical examiners, including one hired by Mr. Timpa’s family, said they did not believe the officers acted recklessly. They could not testify “to the elements of the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt,” Mr. Creuzot said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Dallas Police Department said on Thursday that <!-- -->the three officers<!-- --> have returned to active duty. Two other officers <!-- -->were disciplined over the incident.<!-- --> <!-- -->The department declined to offer any other<!-- --> comment, citing the ongoing litigation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I am glad that the case is moving forward,” Mr. Henley said in his statement. “The criminal action not only kept the footage from public view, it stopped the civil case from proceeding. We can now tell Tony’s story to the public and look forward to doing the same to a jury later next year.”</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Jacey Fortin contributed reporting.</p>
