<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BAGHDAD — Unconvinced by their prime minister’s promises of justice and economic opportunity, Iraqi protesters defied security forces to throng central Baghdad and other cities on Friday, confronting the government with perhaps its biggest challenge since the toppling of Saddam Hussein 16 years ago. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At least eight people were reported killed in Baghdad and four elsewhere, with hundreds of protesters injured, in angry confrontations between demonstrators and security forces. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In one Baghdad confrontation, masked officers shot volleys of tear gas canisters from a bridge to the Green Zone,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>the seat of Parliament and the prime minister, to drive back a crowd of unarmed demonstrators in Tahrir Square. Undeterred, the protesters resurged toward the bridge and were repeatedly repulsed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The protests were a resumption of<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>antigovernment demonstrations that started in the first week of October, but suspended two weeks ago, after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/05/world/middleeast/iraq-protest.html?module=inline" title="">shootings by the security forces</a> killed nearly 150 protesters nationwide, shocking the country and deepening disappointment with the government.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hours before the protests resumed, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, in an extraordinary post-midnight televised address, said he understood the grievances of ordinary Iraqis who have grown embittered over joblessness, endemic corruption and a lack of accountability. He promised remedies.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Mr. Mahdi’s words did nothing to dissuade the turnout on Friday. While it was difficult to gauge the number of protesters, there were signs that a broader spectrum of Iraqis were participating, with many middle-aged people joining the bulk of the protesters who were young men in their teens and 20s. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Every protester was there for his own reasons, but they shared a desperation over the government’s treatment of its people and a complete lack of trust that it can deliver any improvements.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There are no real reforms,” said Gattee Zowayer, 38. “This is just an injection to calm us down, to anesthetize the Iraqi people. We want jobs, lands for the poor people and for the people who are corrupt to be made accountable.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> After an investigation, the government said this week that it would <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/world/middleeast/iraq-protests-generals-court.html?module=inline" title="">prosecute more than a dozen military and police commanders</a> who ordered or oversaw the shootings in early October, in which eight security force members were also killed. The commanders were removed from their jobs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government also announced reforms including a special court to crack down on corruption, as well as the creation of new jobs and housing, but in conversations with more than a dozen protesters from different walks of life, it seemed unlikely that those promises could quell their anger<!-- -->.<!-- --> Many suggested the government is no better than the system in place before the American-led invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My wish is to own just 50 square meters in this country, I have a disabled son and two other children, I just want to care for them,” said Ensam Tamer, 40, who works in construction whenever he can get a job. “Really all I want is to work and I am desperate with this government. They just make lying promises for almost 17 years. They are lying, lying and lying, now all of them are thieves.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The protesters included former members of the Hasht al Shabi, the largely Shiite militia that is now part of the government but is often seen as corrupt and as having factions that answer to Iran.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Those protesting appeared to be ones who had been injured and could no longer work. The demonstrations also included some middle-aged women whose children had graduated from college and had skills but could not find jobs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The confrontations began early Friday morning. After protesters knocked down barriers and entered the Green Zone, security forces fired percussion bombs and tear gas canisters in an attempt to push them back. In addition to the<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>many government offices, the Green zone houses the villas of many senior officials and many embassies. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Expectations of violence were apparent Thursday evening in Baghdad, where cellphone merchants boarded their store windows, money exchanges closed and traffic diminished. As protesters began to gather in Tahrir Square, the site of some of the violence earlier this month, the security forces closed two bridges that lead into the Green Zone. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the provinces, some protesters began setting up tents as if preparing for a long siege. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While it was difficult to project what could happen, the fury among ordinary Iraqis at perceived and real injustices made it seem that Iraq could be facing an internal crisis as serious as anything since elected governments began in the post-Saddam Hussein era. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Prime Minister Mahdi sounded as if he understood the seriousness of the moment, but it was hard to see how he could persuade people to trust that his government was capable of change. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are facing a crisis in the system that the politicians did not recognize,” he said in his post-midnight speech, “but the people realized it, which explains why they have formed a movement.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Among his promises was a more rigorous separation of the armed militias that work with the military from their political wings represented in Parliament, and a sharp reduction in the salaries of senior officials. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Mahdi has promised changes before. The difference is that this time, if the populace is not satisfied, there is fear Iraq could drift into chaos. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Once people go to the streets with legitimate demands, it is too late,” said Abbas Kadhim, a senior fellow and the director of the Iraq Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based research group.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Once the protests start, it is a force on the street,” Mr. Kadhim added, “and most of the time the biggest beneficiaries are not the protesters, it’s anybody who has the skill to manipulate them to their own ends.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For part of Friday,<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>it appeared that all sides would try to refrain from violence. Many in the security forces wore sashes with the red, green, black and white colors of the Iraqi flag and draped flags over their trucks. The protesters, too, wore flags over their shoulders and most avoided confronting the police officers and soldiers who were on the street. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But masked, black-clad forces also appeared, shooting rounds of tear gas and percussion bombs. Some demonstrators suggested they were members of militias backed by Iran, which has been exerting increased political influence in the country. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Look those are not Iraqi forces,” said an old man, pointing up at the Jumhuriyah bridge that leads to the Green Zone as the masked forces advanced across it. “Those are Iraqi forces,” he said pointing at a platoon of soldiers wearing the green and white camouflage of the Iraqi Army.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>Gesturing at the bridge, he said, “those are the tail of Iran.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Members of the Iraqi forces, asked to identify the black-clad forces on the bridge, shook their heads. “Really, we don’t know who they are, they do not come from us,” one said.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About a block away, Saddoun Hashim, a retired teacher who wore wire rimmed glasses and a carefully pressed gray suit and tie, looked mournful as he ruminated on Iraq’s abundant oil wealth and storied past as part of the Middle East’s crescent of civilization.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are the wealthiest country in the world, but we are the poorest. This government is not from our country, it is from a neighboring country,” he said, referring to Iran’s influence. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I am crying for my country.” he said.</p>
