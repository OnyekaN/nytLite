So it is fitting that the early artifacts of the Apollo moon landings, the grandest feat of exploration ever attempted, resemble nothing so much as toys. They are expressions in miniature of giant aspirations, reminders of how engineers play and imagine the future.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Naturally, toy spaceships wouldn’t be complete without little lunar landscapes to place them on, or astronaut dolls to ride in them. But these toys had a serious purpose. For protection against the rigors of high Gs during launch and re-entry, test pilots and astronauts sat on couches that were custom-made to fit their bodies. Lined up, the molds for the couches look for all the world as if the pilots have assumed the position for a spanking.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the time, nobody knew what it would be like to walk in a spacesuit in the trampoline-like low gravity of the moon, or to drive the trackless wastes of lunar grit and boulders. The space age was young, and we were kids with a cosmic gleam in our eyes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times will host “One Giant Leap: The Apollo 11 Moon Landing, 50 Years On” on July 21 at Town Hall in New York City. </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://timesevents.nytimes.com/onegiantleap" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Buy your tickets here</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.
