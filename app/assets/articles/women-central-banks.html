<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">FRANKFURT <!-- -->— The European Central Bank might seem an unlikely place to hold a conference on gender equality. Or it might be exactly the kind of place that needs to.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only one member of the bank’s policymaking Governing Council is a woman — and she recently announced her resignation. The situation is similar at other big central banks. There is only one woman on the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Council, and women are a minority at the top echelon of the Federal Reserve.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Realizing that they have a problem, the Fed, Bank of England and European Central Bank joined forces Monday to examine why there are so few women in monetary policy and what can be done about it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The underrepresentation of women is perhaps nowhere as visible as in central banks,” said <!-- -->Ana Lamo<!-- -->, a senior economist at the European Central Bank. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are more women among the teams of staff economists and other experts who prepare the groundwork for monetary policy. Less than one third of the Fed’s economists are women. Still, there is evidence that female economists are less likely to have their economic research published by central banks, that they are less likely to be promoted, and that their careers are more likely than men’s to suffer when they become parents.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">conference in Frankfurt </a>was timely not only because gender discrimination reduces the pool of talent available to formulate the policies needed to fight a worldwide slowdown in growth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In less than two weeks, Christine Lagarde will become the European Central Bank’s <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/business/christine-lagarde-european-central-bank.html?module=inline" title="">first female president</a>. She will oversee a Governing Council that is openly divided about the bank’s stimulus measures. Ms. Lagarde will be the only woman on the fractious 25-member council at least until a replacement is appointed for <!-- -->Sabine Lautenschläger,<!-- --> a member of the central bank’s six-person <!-- -->Executive Board <!-- -->who <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2019/html/ecb.pr190925~b744158aaa.en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">resigned last month</a>, effective Oct. 31. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When not trying to head off another financial crisis, Ms. Lagarde, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, <!-- -->is expected to make gender a big theme of her eight-year term.<!-- --> The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/conferences/html/20191021_2nd_gender_conference.en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">conference at the European Central Bank headquarters </a>Monday, which she did not attend, helped explain why women have trouble rising through the ranks of central banks and other big organizations. It also suggested some remedies.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Outright discrimination is one obvious cause. <!-- -->Laura Hospido<!-- -->, an economist at the Bank of Spain, presented research she did with <!-- -->Carlos Sanz<!-- -->, also from the Spanish central bank, showing that economic papers by women are less likely to be accepted for publication than papers by men.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Deepa D. Datta<!-- -->, an economist at the Fed, examined 3,000 research papers published by the American central bank and found that men were more likely to collaborate with other men on research. Ms. Datta said her study, conducted with <!-- -->Robert Vigfusson<!-- --> of the Fed, didn’t prove that discrimination was at play, though that was an obvious implication. Publishing papers is crucial to career advancement in economics.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Economics is a highly competitive, often unfriendly profession — <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/upshot/evidence-of-a-toxic-environment-for-women-in-economics.html?module=inline" title="">especially if you’re a woman</a>, according to research presented by <!-- -->Alicia Modestino<!-- -->, an associate professor at Northeastern University.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She and <!-- -->Muriel Niederle<!-- --> of Stanford University and Justin Wolfers of the University of Michigan dispatched more than 90 student researchers to economics seminars at leading universities. Armed with a special iPad app, the students secretly tallied the interactions. Women speakers were more likely to be interrupted during the seminar and to face hostile questioning, according to the research.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Numerous speakers said <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/business/why-womens-voices-are-scarce-in-economics.html?module=inline" title="">more needs to be done to encourage women to study economics</a>. That is especially a problem for racial minorities, whose problems don’t get enough attention, said <!-- -->Rhonda Sharpe<!-- -->, president of the Women’s Institute for Science, Equity and Race in Mechanicsville, Va. Only a handful of African-American, Hispanic or Native American women earn economics doctorates, she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The bulk of the conversation centers on white women,” Ms. Sharpe said during a panel discussion.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ghazala Azmat<!-- --> of Sciences Po, an elite university in <!-- -->Paris<!-- -->, presented research which analyzed advancement at American law firms and was implicitly applicable to any highly competitive profession. Although women joined law firms at the same rate as men, according to the research, they were much less likely to become partners.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One reason was that they became discouraged by negative experiences early in their careers, including sexual harassment. Women who reported being harassed were much less likely to make partner, according to the research conducted with <!-- -->Vicente Cuñat<!-- --> of the London School of Economics and <!-- -->Emeric Henry<!-- --> of Sciences Po.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One young questioner in the audience summarized the problem as “creepy men.” In the pursuit of a career, she asked, “How much can you put up with?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Iris Bohnet<!-- -->, academic dean at Harvard Kennedy School, cited research showing that orchestras in the United States increased the number of female musicians when they allowed applicants to audition from behind a curtain. Organizations including central banks can achieve the same result by, for example, removing names from résumés and standardizing interview questions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Fed has sought to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/business/economy/federal-reserve-diversity-hiring.html?module=inline" title="">increase its hiring of women </a>and people from minority groups by recruiting from a wider variety of universities and looking at criteria like job experience, not just academic grades. But the Fed is still struggling to increase the number of women at senior levels.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Lamo of the European Central Bank said that the bank was able to equalize promotion rates for men and women after declaring in 2010 that it wanted to promote diversity. Women were added to selection committees, managers were given hiring targets and women were encouraged to take leadership training programs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But no one in the conference addressed how to fix the imbalance at the very top of the central banks. That problem is outside their control. The members of policy-setting bodies are chosen by political leaders, who especially in Europe have shown a strong bias in favor of men.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And several speakers at the conference Monday lamented that the audience was overwhelmingly female. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You’re preaching to the converted,” said Guido Friebel, a professor at Goethe University in Frankfurt.</p>
