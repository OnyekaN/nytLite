The lessons of Colorado’s ups and downs with regulated marijuana have plenty to teach California as it tries to wrap its arms around the unintended consequences of legalization.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some in Colorado’s marijuana industry feel as if the focus of the legalization debate is veering away from the Rockies and toward California. California is already a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://bdsanalytics.com/the-2018-california-cannabis-marketplace-in-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">vastly larger market </a>— about $2.5 billion in sales last year, compared with Colorado’s $1.5 billion.
