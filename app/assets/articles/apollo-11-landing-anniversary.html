<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the morning of July 16, 1969, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins lifted off for the moon. Four days later, Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin set foot on the moon’s surface, the first of 12 American astronauts to complete this feat. Apollo 11 fascinated the world, with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/business/media/apollo-11-television-media.html?module=inline" title="">hundreds of millions tuning in to watch it on TV</a>. It also <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/06/science/neil-armstrong-moon-rocks.html?module=inline" title="">changed the way we understood our solar system</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html?module=inline"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/science/astronomy-space-calendar.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar</em></a></a><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fifty years later, the amazement caused by Apollo 11 has not worn off. The New York Times has been covering the anniversary of the moon landing, looking back at the event’s meaning, and forward to humankind’s next giant leaps in space.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here is a roundup of some of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/apollo-11-moon-landing?module=inline" title="">our reporting this year on Apollo 11</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The story of Apollo 11 never really gets old, nor does seeing pictures of the amazing scenes that surrounded it. From the astronauts preparing for their mission to the rocket launching to those first bootprints on the moon’s surface, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/science/apollo-11-moon-landing-photos.html?module=inline" title="">we collected some of our favorite pictures here</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are other ways of looking back at the moon landing too. Photographers for The Times captured people around New York City who couldn’t take their eyes off the mission’s progress.

Ed Dwight was to be America’s first black astronaut, a person in whom the stories of the space race and the civil rights movement briefly met. How the effort to integrate America’s space explorers <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/ed-dwight-was-set-to-be-the-first-black-astronaut-heres-why-that-never-happened.html?module=inline" title="">came up short is told here</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Then there is the vanishing history, such as the big hubs in Southern California and on Long Island that built key pieces of the Apollo spacecraft. The sites are gone, but <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/science/apollo-moon-nasa-engineers.html?module=inline" title="">the stories of people who worked in them live on</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/science/apollo-11-mission-control-nasa.html?module=inline" title="">NASA reopened its restored mission control room in Houston</a>, making a museum piece that is alive, as though the engineers just stepped away briefly.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finally, John Noble Wilford, a science writer for The Times who covered the moon landing, described how his famous July 21, 1969, news story was written. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/18/science/apollo-11-john-noble-wilford.html?module=inline" title="">Read it here</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Why do we go to space? It’s a question we haven’t fully answered, even amid this Apollo 11 nostalgia. Dennis Overbye, a scribe of the science department, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/science/apollo-moon-space.html?module=inline" title="">provides his own answer here</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ken Liu, a science fiction writer, closely examined the messages of good will from world leaders left there by the Apollo 11 astronauts. Read his essay about the difficulty that comes with trying to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/science/apollo-11-goodwill-messages.html?module=inline" title="">detach our off-world explorations from our conflicts on Earth</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Women were excluded from America’s early astronaut corps, even though it was known at the time that they might outperform men on some measures. Mary Robinette Kowal, a science fiction writer, summarizes <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/science/women-astronauts-nasa.html?module=inline" title="">the history of gender bias in the space program</a>, and highlights errors to learn from as NASA plans to send a woman to the moon in the next decade.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Finally, how has the conspiracy theory that the moon landing was a hoax persisted? It’s not the internet’s fault, but Amanda Hess explores a new generation of conspiracy theorists who have dug into Apollo 11 for the amusement of their audiences. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/science/moon-landing-hoax-conspiracy-theory.html?module=inline" title="">Read it here</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There’s something of a new moon race underway on Earth. But countries like China and India have very different reasons for landing there, as do private companies. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/science/nasa-moon-apollo-artemis.html?module=inline" title="">Read about them here</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But once we go back, staying for any length of time could be difficult.
