<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">LONDON — The London Stock Exchange Group agreed on Thursday to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.lseg.com/resources/media-centre/press-releases/proposed-all-share-acquisition-refinitiv-create-financial-markets-infrastructure-leader-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">buy Refinitiv</a>, the financial information service, for about $27 billion as it seeks to enter the lucrative business of market data and compete with giants like Bloomberg L.P.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is a sign of how stock markets — even the centuries-old London exchange, one of the oldest in the world — must venture beyond company listings to grow profits. Financial data, the lifeblood of the trading industry, has emerged as a big avenue for such growth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By buying Refinitiv, a former arm of Thomson Reuters that is now controlled by the investment giant Blackstone and others, the London exchange would be able to sell market information around the world. The British company hopes that the deal will make it a key cog of the plumbing that underpins the financial industry.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“With the acquisition of Refinitiv, we will transform our position as a leading global financial markets infrastructure group,” David Schwimmer, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group, said in a statement.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shares in the London Stock Exchange Group rose more than 7 percent in trading on Thursday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the deal puts the London exchange up against big and well-entrenched competitors. Other market operators — including the IntercontinentalExchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange — already have global presences and robust market data offerings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Refinitiv’s Eikon data terminal business has long lagged that of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/business/dealbook/start-up-taking-aim-at-bloomberg-terminals-hires-former-bloomberg-head.html?module=inline" title="">Bloomberg</a>, the undisputed leader of that industry.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And analysts expect the Refinitiv transaction to face heavy regulatory scrutiny.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, if it closes, the deal would be a notable success for the London exchange after years of trying to strike other acquisitions. Two years ago, European antitrust regulators blocked the company from merging with the Deutsche Börse Group, which would have created a market operator with enormous sway across the Continent.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And nearly a decade ago, the London exchange tried to combine with the Toronto Stock Exchange. That merger fell apart after the Canadian company’s shareholders threatened to vote it down.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thursday’s transaction would be a quick and lucrative win for Refinitiv’s majority owners, led by Blackstone. That consortium bought control of Refinitiv last year at a $20 billion valuation. Thomson Reuters kept a 45 percent stake in the business.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under the terms of the deal, the Blackstone-led group will become the biggest shareholder in the London exchange, with the right to name three directors.</p>
