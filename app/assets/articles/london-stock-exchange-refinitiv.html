<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">LONDON — For more than 300 years, the London Stock Exchange has been one of the world’s most enduring symbols of capitalism. But offering a market for trading shares is not enough for stock exchanges these days.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, in a sign of how the business has changed, the London exchange’s parent company agreed to buy Refinitiv, a big provider of financial data, for about $27 billion, including debt.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Market data, the lifeblood of the trading industry, has emerged as a big avenue for growth. The all-stock deal to acquire Refinitiv, a former arm of Thomson Reuters that is now controlled by the investment giant Blackstone and others, will put the London Stock Exchange Group in competition with giants like Bloomberg L.P.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Exchange operators in the United States — including Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the New York Stock Exchange, and Nasdaq — have counted on market data as an important source of sales to stock brokerages and other institutions, with revenues now rivalling those of traditional stock market services.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some exchanges have been accused by customers of excessively raising the prices they charge. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-to-rule-nyse-nasdaq-didnt-justify-market-data-fee-increases-1539721232" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">denied requests</a> by the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to raise fees on some sets of that information.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The London Stock Exchange will gain Refinitiv’s Eikon division, which sells terminals that allow customers to pull up an array of financial data and message with others.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Together, the London exchange and Refinitiv collected about 6 billion pounds, or $7.3 billion, in sales last year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“With the acquisition of Refinitiv, we will transform our position as a leading global financial markets infrastructure group,” David Schwimmer, who has served as the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange Group for about a year, said in a statement.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shares in the London Stock Exchange Group rose more than 7 percent in trading on Thursday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the deal puts the London exchange up against big and well-entrenched competitors. Both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq already have global presences and robust market data offerings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Refinitiv’s Eikon data terminal division has long lagged that of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/business/dealbook/start-up-taking-aim-at-bloomberg-terminals-hires-former-bloomberg-head.html?module=inline" title="">Bloomberg</a>, the undisputed leader of that industry. Despite charging customers roughly $20,000 per terminal, Bloomberg controls what analysts have estimated is roughly a third of the market.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And analysts expect the Refinitiv transaction to face heavy regulatory scrutiny.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, if it closes, the deal would be a notable success for the London exchange after years of trying to strike other acquisitions. Two years ago, European antitrust regulators blocked the company from merging with the Deutsche Börse Group, which would have created a market operator with enormous sway across the Continent.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And nearly a decade ago, the London exchange tried to combine with the Toronto Stock Exchange. That merger fell apart after the Canadian company’s shareholders threatened to vote it down.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thursday’s transaction would be a quick and lucrative win for Refinitiv’s majority owners, led by Blackstone. That consortium bought control of Refinitiv last year at a $20 billion valuation. Thomson Reuters kept a 45 percent stake in the business.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Under the terms of the deal, the Blackstone-led group will become the biggest shareholder in the London exchange, with the right to name three directors.</p>
