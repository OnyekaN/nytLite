<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">JOHANNESBURG — Voters in Botswana returned to power the party of President Mokgweetsi Masisi, the country’s chief justice announced on Friday, <!-- -->a triumph<!-- --> for a leader who had made contentious <!-- -->decisions<!-- --> to lift a ban on hunting elephants and to oversee the decriminalization of homosexuality. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A diamond-rich country of just over two million people, Botswana has long been held up as one of Africa’s most stable democracies. This election, held on Wednesday, <!-- -->was described<!-- --> by analysts as the country’s most fiercely contested yet, electrified by a clash between Mr. Masisi and his predecessor, Ian Khama, who broke with the party that has governed the country since independence.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While votes were still being counted, the chief justice, Terrence Rannoane, said in a televised address that the partial results were sufficient to secure a parliamentary majority for Mr. Masisi’s Botswana Democratic Party. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Rannoane, who also serves as the presiding officer for elections, did not provide additional details about the results. But the governing party <!-- -->declared<!-- --> in a statement that it had won a “resounding victory,” claiming 38 out of the Parliament’s 57 directly elected seats, <!-- -->one more than in the previous election, in 2014<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The lawmakers in Parliament choose the country’s president, and in this case are expected to re-elect Mr. Masisi, the <!-- -->Botswana Democratic Party leader<!-- -->.<!-- --> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Keith Jefferis, an economist and political analyst, said the level of support that the governing party received among urban voters was notable.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Opposition parties have previously dominated urban centers, but Mr. Masisi — who built his career in the nation’s capital — managed to sway young professionals there “in a way that none of us were really able to envisage,” Dr. Jefferis said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Botswana Democratic Party had suffered a split in May, when Mr. Khama — a son of Botswana’s independence leader, Seretse Khama — defected from its ranks, accusing Mr. Masisi of departing from its values. That included the government’s decision in May to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/world/africa/botswana-elephant-hunting.html?module=inline" title="">lift a five-year ban on trophy hunting</a>, including on elephants, a move that had been seen as popular among rural voters.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Botswana, home to the world’s largest elephant population, has one of the best wildlife records in Africa but has struggled to completely rein in the illegal ivory trade. Defending his decision to lift the ban, Mr. Masisi told voters that he was prioritizing the needs of his people over the wildlife valued by Western countries.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Further departing from his predecessor’s policies, Mr. Masisi also endorsed a June court ruling that struck down colonial-era laws against homosexuality. The decision was unpopular in many rural constituencies.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Diamonds are also a source of debate. Botswana is the world’s second largest producer of diamonds, after Russia, and the gems are a major contributor to its economy. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government jointly owns the world’s most valuable diamond mining company with De Beers, and that contract, which is up for renewal in 2021, was a major issue in the election campaign. Duma Boko, the human rights lawyer who leads the Umbrella for Democratic Change, an opposition coalition, had vowed to seek “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ft.com/content/331e0600-f414-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">much fairer and more equitable terms</a>” for Botswana.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Masisi came to power last year after Mr. Khama served two terms as president. Although Mr. Khama had handpicked Mr. Masisi as his successor, the two leaders diverged on key policy issues and fell out after Mr. Masisi fired the country’s intelligence chief. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In retaliation, Mr. Khama — known for shirking media interviews during his own presidency — publicly criticized Mr. Masisi.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The former leader also threw his support behind the Botswana Patriotic Front, a newly formed party, diluting the governing party’s majority. And he encouraged voters to back the Umbrella for Democratic Change, which was once his bitter political rival. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Khama, a retired army general, had also alienated party members during his time as president, from 2008 to 2018. His predecessor, Festus Mogae, told the local news media that the leader was a “disappointment,” prone to “tantrums” if he did not get his way. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the tensions among politicians, voting on Wednesday was peaceful.<!-- --> In some districts, polling hours were extended as voters lined up. Ahead of the poll, an Afrobarometer survey showed fears that the political infighting would distract from more pressing issues like the economy. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Now with a mandate to govern, Mr. Masisi is likely to concentrate on expanding Botswana’s economy, where the prosperity of the country’s rich diamond fields has not trickled down to the general population. Botswana has an unemployment rate of 18 percent, and more than a third of young people are without work.</p>
