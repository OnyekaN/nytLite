<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Computer systems in 23 small Texas towns have been hacked, seized and held for ransom in a widespread, coordinated cyberattack, the authorities said this week. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Texas Department of Information Resources said Monday that it was racing to bring systems back online after the “ransomware attack,” in which hackers remotely block access to important data until a ransom is paid. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was unclear who was responsible for the attacks, which occurred last week. The state described the attacker only as “one single threat actor.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Elliott Sprehe<!-- -->, a spokesman for the department, declined to provide further specifics or release the names of the towns affected because of the “potential for further attacks.” He said the attacks largely affected specific departments within those towns. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He declined to say if any of the towns had paid up.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s limited to just a handful of areas,” Mr. Sprehe said. “It’s not disparate throughout the state.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Allan Liska<!-- -->, an analyst with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Recorded Future</a>, a cybersecurity firm, said that the attack in Texas was “absolutely the largest coordinated attack” <!-- -->on cities<!-- --> he had seen in terms of the number of targets, and that “it may be the first time that we’ve seen a coordinated attack.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If this turns out to be a new phase — because bad guys love to copycat each other — we’re going to see a continued acceleration of these kinds of attacks,” Mr. Liska said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hospitals, businesses and other networks have for years been targets of ransomware attacks. But in recent years, hackers <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/07/us/florida-ransom-hack.html?module=inline" title="">have increasingly focused</a> on local governments. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ransomware attacks often begin after employees click on links or download attachments containing malicious code from seemingly harmless emails. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In May, hackers seized part of the computer systems that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/us/baltimore-ransomware.html?module=inline" title="">run Baltimore’s city government</a>, delaying the delivery of water bills and preventing the health department from issuing critical alerts. In March 2018, a cyberattack targeted <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/us/cyberattack-atlanta-ransomware.html?module=inline" title="">some parts of the City of Atlanta’s network</a> for days, including systems involving police reports and employment applications.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2018, Mr. Liska said, there were 54 publicly reported attacks on city, county and state governments, as well as court systems, emergency services and school districts.<!-- --> So far this year, excluding the Texas attacks, his firm has identified 61<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ransomware attacks, particularly those in Atlanta and Baltimore, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/us/politics/states-voting-systems.html?module=inline" title="">have also prompted further scrutiny</a> of the country’s election systems. If hackers seize states’ voter registration systems just before Election Day, for example, it could create substantial problems with ensuring all voters are registered and casting only one ballot.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For the Texas towns that have already been compromised, the options are limited. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cisecurity.org/about-us/leadership/brian-calkin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Brian Calkin</a>, chief technology officer at the nonprofit <!-- -->C<!-- -->enter for <!-- -->I<!-- -->nternet <!-- -->S<!-- -->ecurity<!-- -->, said it depended on the particulars of the system, but there were essentially three choices.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The first is to <!-- -->pay the ransom, <!-- -->which he said was ultimately a business decision, but also a moral one because it perpetuates the problem and the criminals behind it. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The second option is to restore data from backup files that have been stored offline. But if officials take too long to deliberate and miss the ransom deadline, or there are no backup files, the<!-- --> third<!-- --> option “is less fun,” he said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You’re really looking at rebuilding from scratch,” he said, “which is an unenvious place to be for sure.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">State and local government entities are likely to pay ransom only <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/state-local-government-ransomware-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">about 17 percent of the time</a>, according to Mr. Liska’s analysis. But criminals get heightened media attention when they target cities.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Earlier this summer<!-- -->, two Florida cities agreed to shell out almost a million dollars to placate attackers. The leaders of Riviera Beach, Fla., paid the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/us/florida-riviera-beach-hacking-ransom.html?module=inline" title="">sum of nearly $600,000</a>. And officials in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/lake-city-florida-ransom-cyberattack.html?module=inline" title="">Lake City, Fla., eventually paid $460,000</a> (or 42 Bitcoin) after the city’s computer systems were paralyzed for several days.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“With your heart, you really don’t want to pay these guys,” Mayor Stephen Witt of Lake City said at the time. “But, dollars and cents, representing the citizens, that was the right thing to do.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As a precaution, officials in <!-- -->one Texas count<!-- -->y took some of their systems offline over the weekend, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kxii.com/content/news/Some-Grayson-Co-systems-taken-down-as-precaution-after-statewide-ransomware-attack-553979621.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to the local Fox station, KXII</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We took steps to — in effect — pull in our drawbridge,” Bill Magers, the Grayson County judge, told the station. “We will continue to take all steps necessary to protect the information system used to serve our taxpayers.”</p>
