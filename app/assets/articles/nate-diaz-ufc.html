<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nate Diaz, a popular and outspoken star of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, said that he would not fight next week at New York’s Madison Square Garden, as planned, because he had tested positive for a banned substance.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Diaz said in a text message that he was unsure what the banned substance is. But on Thursday afternoon, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/NateDiaz209/status/1187483429803196416" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">in a tweet that was light on details but heavy on profanity</a>, Diaz told his 1.3 million followers that he would not be fighting “because they say I tested with elevated levels that they say might be from some tainted supplements.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I call false on that,” he added.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked for clarification, Diaz said in a subsequent text message that he did not know the substance that caused a positive result.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They won’t tell me they’re being shady I got nothing to b shady about,” he wrote. He did not immediately respond to follow-up questions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Diaz was scheduled to fight Jorge Masvidal on <!-- -->Nov. 2<!-- --> in a <!-- -->welterweigh<!-- -->t fight to headline a card billed as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-244" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">U.F.C. 244</a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-244" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked about Diaz’s disclosure, a U.F.C. spokeswoman said that she is “looking into this,” and had no other immediate comment.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">U.F.C. is accustomed to late changes in its fight cards, but any cancellation involving Diaz could be very costly, at the box office and in pay-per-view receipts, because of Diaz’s popularity.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Conor McGregor quickly chimed in, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/TheNotoriousMMA/status/1187491388142821377" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">saying on Twitter that he was willing to replace Diaz for the fight.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Diaz, a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/sports/nate-diaz-ufc-241-pettis.html?module=inline" title="">pot-smoking, unfiltered antihero</a> from Stockton, Calif., was a journeyman fighter who beat McGregor in 2016 as a last-minute replacement. McGregor avenged the defeat five months later, and Diaz stopped fighting for most of three years.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He returned in August to great fanfare and beat Anthony Pettis. His fight with Masvidal in New York was seen as a possible avenue back to a third fight against McGregor, who is mired in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/19/sports/conor-mcgregor-sexual-assault-accusation.html?module=inline" title="">sexual-assault allegations</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Until UFC, Usada, or whoever is (expletive) with me Fixes it, I won’t be competing,” Diaz told his followers in a tweet filled with profanity and misspellings. “Im not gonna play their game and try to hide it or keep quite(sic), as they suggested. I’m not gonna have my name tainted as a cheater.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said other fighters keep quiet until after they fight in order to get a payday. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s cheating,” Diaz wrote. “So fight game I’ll see you when I see you.”</p>
