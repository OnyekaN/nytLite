<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">RICHMOND, Va. — On a sweltering afternoon, Kirk Cox, the powerful Republican speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, was chatting to voters and handing out free hot dogs at a campaign event when he was approached by a woman.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The two made small talk before the woman, Vanessa Wilkerson, 62, cautioned the conservative lawmaker that she hardly fit the profile of his typical supporter. “I’m a Democrat,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cox might once have moved on, but, after decades of representing one of the safest Republican seats in the nation, he must vie for every vote this fall — even the unlikeliest ones.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Facing a Democratic opponent in a district with new boundaries, Mr. Cox has been campaigning with the ardor of a man who has everything to lose: He has spent the summer in khaki shorts and sneakers knocking on doors in unfamiliar neighborhoods.

In recent years, Virginia has become more Democratic as suburbs around Washington, Richmond and Hampton Roads, Virginia’s so-called urban crescent, have grown and population declines have persisted in the state’s western, rural areas, which have traditionally been Republican.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Republicans say they can hold on to power by focusing on restricting access to abortions late in pregnancy and protecting gun rights in some areas of the state, while focusing on improving schools and cutting taxes in more moderate areas.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They have also reminded voters of a scandal that swirled around Democratic leaders this year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Gov. Ralph Northam has struggled to recover politically after acknowledging that he appeared in a photograph either <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/us/politics/ralph-northam-yearbook-blackface.html?module=inline" title="">wearing blackface</a> or dressed as a member of the Ku Klux Klan when he was a medical student in 1984. (Mr. Northam first admitted being in the photograph and then <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/us/politics/ralph-northam-virginia-governor.html?module=inline" title="">flatly denied it</a>.) Two other Democrats, Justin Fairfax, the lieutenant governor, and Mark Herring, the attorney general, were also embroiled in scandal. Mr. Fairfax has denied allegations of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/us/politics/meredith-watson-justin-fairfax.html?module=inline" title="">sexual assault</a>.

His district was once overwhelmingly <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vpap.org/offices/house-of-delegates-66/redistricting/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">white and Republican</a>; now, it is more than one-third African-American, and Democrats outnumber Republicans.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With the election nearing, Republicans acknowledged that Mr. Cox, first elected in 1989, might be in trouble — and, more critically, that the party’s slim majorities might not survive.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The House is still very much in play, but it is going to be tougher,” said John Findlay, the executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, about the court-imposed maps.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The political differences between Mr. Cox and his Democratic opponent, Sheila Bynum-Coleman, could hardly be more stark.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Bynum-Coleman, who is African-American, supports abortion rights, gun control and raising the state’s $7.25-an-hour minimum wage; Mr. Cox, who is white, opposes all three.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cox, 61, oversaw a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?192+sum+HB4021&amp;fbclid=IwAR1r_161aFYmdPqMMm1GgQCtwasQLzr-neoQjxekgJc6VLjm3uzRoemDW0E" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">special legislative session</a> in July in which Republicans refused to consider gun legislation introduced by Democrats. The session lasted only about 90 minutes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Bynum-Coleman, 47, has made gun restrictions a central tenet of her campaign, speaking often about how her <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sheilafordelegate.com/priorities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">daughter was wounded</a> by gunfire at a party.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent months, there have been indications that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.gunstocarry.com/gun-laws-state/virginia-gun-laws/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Virginia’s liberal gun laws</a> have become less popular after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/us/virginia-beach-dewayne-craddock.html?module=inline" title="">12 people were killed</a> in a mass shooting in Virginia Beach in May.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Annette Skinner, a Democratic voter who was at Mr. Cox’s hot dog event in July, said she viewed gun control as a central issue in the coming election.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“People who can get a gun should be getting a background check,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cox has stuck to what he describes as a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kirkcox.com/major-advocacy-groups-endorse-kirk-cox-66th-house-district/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“common-sense conservative agenda,”</a> which he acknowledges has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/speakercox/status/1082327790572261376?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">changed little</a> over the years.

In 2017, he won by 27 points.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But now, his district — 63 percent Republican in 2011 — is 53 percent Democratic, and only about half of the 21 precincts that make up the new district are in neighborhoods he represented previously.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dana Layne, a voter in the new district, said she tended to support Republicans and had been impressed by Mr. Cox’s efforts to win pay raises for teachers, though she wanted more job opportunities for local residents — including job training — in a district that includes areas that are urban, suburban and rural.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Ms. Bynum-Coleman, Mr. Cox’s opponent, said the speaker was out of step in a district that includes far more African-Americans and Democrats than he represented in the past.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Virginia,” she said, “has changed.”</p>
