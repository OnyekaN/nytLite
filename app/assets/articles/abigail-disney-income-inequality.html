<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">LOS ANGELES — Walt Disney’s grandniece Abigail Disney, a critic of income inequality in general and the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/business/media/disney-heiress-attacks-pay-practices.html?module=inline" title="">Walt Disney Company’s pay practices in particular</a>, castigated the conglomerate anew on Monday, saying she came away “livid” about wages after a visit to Disneyland.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Wednesday, Disney punched back, calling Ms. Disney’s assertions “a gross and unfair exaggeration of the facts.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Disney, the granddaughter of Roy O. Disney, who founded the entertainment company in 1923 with his brother Walt, appeared on the Yahoo News video series “Through Her Eyes” this week. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://news.yahoo.com/i-was-so-livid-disney-heiress-visits-theme-park-undercover-to-see-worker-conditions-093000722.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The interview</a> touched on a range of sensitive topics — her archly conservative parents were, at times, abusive alcoholics, she said — but her comments about wages for Disneyland workers in California were widely picked up online.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I went to Anaheim, and I wanted to be sure I understood the situation and the context really, really well,” Ms. Disney said. “Every single one of these people I talked to were saying, ‘I don’t know how I can maintain this face of joy and warmth when I have to go home and forage for food in other people’s garbage.’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She added, “At a company that has never been more profitable, there is no excuse for any employee to be using food stamps, to be doubling up on housing.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Disney, 59, did not say whether she spoke to full- or part-time workers. Her visit occurred sometime last year. For much of 2018, Disneyland was engaged in contract negotiations with five unions that represent its workers. New multiyear deals were<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-disneyland-contract-hotel-workers-20180923-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> eventually reached</a> with all of them, with Disney agreeing to increase starting hourly pay to a minimum of $15, from $13.25.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Disney did not respond to an interview request on Wednesday. The Yahoo interviewer, Zainab Salbi, initially described Ms. Disney’s theme park visit as “undercover” but corrected herself on Wednesday in a Twitter post. “For the record, she NEVER said she went ‘undercover’ to Anaheim,” Ms. Salbi wrote.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The company said in a lengthy statement that it rejected Ms. Disney’s comments as “baseless” and “egregious.” It called her claims a “stunt” and “an insult to the thousands of employees who are part of the Disney community.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Disney noted that hourly workers at its theme parks in California and Florida earn an average of $19.50 an hour, well above the federal minimum wage. “But we understand the challenges workers and families face in 2019 are complex and go beyond the paycheck,” the company said. “That’s why we provide a wide range of benefits and initiatives to improve our employees’ lives at and outside of work: from subsidized child care to generous leave policies, from convenient access to pharmacies and clinics to free college degrees and vocational training programs for hourly employees.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Disney family has not been involved in managing the company since Roy E. Disney, Ms. Disney’s father, stepped down from the board in 2003. He subsequently led a shareholder revolt that resulted in Michael D. Eisner’s resignation as chief executive and Robert A. Iger’s ascendance to the top of the company. Roy E. Disney <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/17/arts/television/17disney.html?module=inline" title="">died in 2009</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Disney is the director of a 2014 documentary, “The Armor of Light,” that follows an anti-abortion activist and a supporter of abortion rights. She has recently started to work on a possible documentary about income inequality.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She is also a founder of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/killer-content-abigail-disney-level-forward-studio-1202664003/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Level Forward</a>, a start-up that backs media projects — films, stage shows, podcasts — driven by women and people of color.</p>
