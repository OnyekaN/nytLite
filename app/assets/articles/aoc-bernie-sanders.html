<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Bernie Sanders is <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-loves-eugene-v-debs-documentary-2015-9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a longtime admirer</a> of Eugene Debs, the labor organizer and political radical who pioneered a distinctly American socialism in the first decades of the 20th century. Before Sanders, Debs was the most successful socialist candidate in American history, winning hundreds of thousands of votes in the final four of his five campaigns for president. He <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1912" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">won 6 percent</a> of the national popular vote in 1912, the equivalent, in 2016 numbers, of more than eight million votes</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Debs was best known for his thundering attacks on industrial capitalism. A tireless campaigner, he crisscrossed the country denouncing the inhumane conditions of factory labor and berating the capitalist class for its destructive obsession with profit. “In the wage system you and your children, and your children’s children, if capitalism shall prevail until they are born, are condemned to slavery and there is no possible hope unless by throwing over the capitalists and voting for socialism,” Debs <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/21257/fourth-july-eugene-debs-socialism-flag-independence-day" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">declared</a> in a speech delivered at an Independence Day celebration in Chicago in 1901.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Debs didn’t just condemn his class enemies. He also called on his audiences to imagine a better world — to realize the democratic and egalitarian promise of the American Revolution through collective action. “We live in the most favored land beneath the unbending sky,” he said in a speech in 1900. “We have all the raw materials and the most marvelous machinery, millions of eager inhabitants seeking employment. Nothing is so easily produced as wealth, and no man should suffer for the need of it.” Debs’s appeal, noted the historian Nick Salvatore in his 1982 biography, “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/89qkp3dk9780252074523.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and Socialist</a>,” was “frequently described by contemporaries as evangelical, and transcended at that moment factional disagreements and led each in the audience to glimpse a different social order.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Or, as one self-described “hard-bitten socialist” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=uJzZDbmFASkC&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;ots=Z2eCHZCIPu&amp;dq=%22debasing%20greed%20for%20gain%20which%20pre-eminently%20distinguishes%20the%20age%22&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q=%22brotherhood%20of%20man%22&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said</a> to the journalist Heywood Broun at the time: “That old man with the burning eyes actually believes that there can be such a thing as the brotherhood of man. And that’s not the funniest part of it. As long as he’s around, I believe it myself.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/jamellebouie?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Join Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet.

It was a show of force for Sanders, who was recently hospitalized following a heart attack.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The highlight of the event was a heartfelt endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/politics/bernie-sanders-aoc-new-york-rally/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">who credited</a> Sanders for her political awakening while she was working as a bartender. “It wasn’t until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being who deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage,” Ocasio-Cortez said, very much echoing the sentiment of those stirred to politics by Debs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HbS65oiN18" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Sanders gave a speech, too</a>. Most of it was familiar. He spoke on housing and homelessness, called for universal health care and free college education, blasted mass incarceration and an unequal criminal justice system and condemned “the 1 percent” for its greed and selfishness. But the part that stood out — his “Debsian moment,” so to speak — came at the end, when he closed the rally with a call for solidarity.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I want you all to take a look around and find someone you don’t know. Maybe somebody who doesn’t look like you, maybe somebody who might be a different religion than you, maybe they came from a different country,” Sanders said. “My question now to you is are you willing to fight for that person who you don’t even know as much as you’re willing to fight for yourself?” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/staceykhizder/status/1185653567451029504?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">He went on</a>:</p><p class="css-ma92ss evys1bk0">Because if you are willing to do that, if you are willing to love, if you are willing to fight for a government of compassion and justice and decency, if you are willing to stand up to Trump’s desire to divide us up, if you are prepared to stand up to the greed and corruption of the corporate elite, if you and millions of others are prepared to do that, then there is no doubt in my mind that not only will we win the election but together we will transform this country.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is striking to see this distinctly moral language coming from a presidential campaign. And I would have jumped to Debs as an analogy regardless of Sanders’s own connection to the socialist pioneer, which includes <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4i054Ylips" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a short documentary</a> on Debs as well as <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://folkways.si.edu/bernard-sanders/eugene-v-debs-trade-unionist-socialist-revolutionary-1855-1926/oral-history-biography/album/smithsonian" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a spoken-word album</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As it stands, the fact of Sanders’s admiration makes the connection even more striking. In his epilogue, Salvatore notes how for many Americans of the era, Debs “symbolized his generation’s protest against industrial capitalism. His personal qualities assumed political importance and his agitation touched the hearts and <!-- -->affect<!-- -->ed the lives of real people.” Bernie Sanders has done something similar. His campaigns have given a generation of people a language and framework for understanding the political, economic and ecological threats to American democracy, as well as articulating an alternative vision for the country.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ocasio-Cortez is, again, emblematic. “We need to build a mass movement, centered on the working class, the poor, the middle class, one that is actively anti-racist, that is rooted in principles of universality,” she said in her endorsement. “Everybody has a right to health care, everybody has a right to an education.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If Sanders actually makes it to the White House, then he’ll be able to continue this work from the summit of American politics. If he doesn’t, then unlike Debs, he’ll have a natural successor. And the deafening applause for Ocasio-Cortez at the rally is a glimpse of what that future might look like.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
