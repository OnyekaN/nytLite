That may not sound very surprising given the politics of this blue state, where Democrats hold every statewide office and about three-quarters of the seats in the Legislature. Or given the toll of police shootings on its people: California police officers kill someone, on average, every two to three days — a rate that’s higher than the national average.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lawmakers shelved a bill last year to set a tougher standard for the police to use deadly force. It was inspired by the death of Stephon Clark, who was shot by the Sacramento police in his grandparents’ backyard after officers mistook the cellphone he was holding for a gun. Its failure was in part attributed to the sway police unions have in the Capitol.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Read more about </em></strong><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/us/california-today-stephon-clark.html?module=inline" title=""><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">the Stephon Clark case here.</em></strong></a><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This year, as legislative leaders urged civil rights advocates and law enforcement groups to negotiate, tensions have flared. Demonstrators marched in Sacramento after prosecutors cleared the officers who killed Mr. Clark. Politicians attended the funerals of two officers from the Sacramento region who were killed. And new legislation to regulate the use of force spurred <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://calmatters.org/justice/2019/04/police-shooting-legislation-advances-california-standards-lethal-force-bill/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">emotional public testimony</a> — from Californians whose family members have been killed by the police, lawmakers who served in law enforcement and a sheriff’s deputy who was shot by a man who killed her partner.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Eventually, the negotiations <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://calmatters.org/politics/2019/05/california-police-use-of-force-standards-lethal-shootings-legislature/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">yielded a compromise</a> that supporters say will give California one of the nation’s toughest statewide standards for the use of deadly force. The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://calmatters.org/justice/2019/07/new-ca-rules-deadly-police-force-go-to-governors-desk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Legislature passed the bill</a> this month and Gov. Gavin Newsom has said he intends to sign it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So what does it do?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The bill says the police can use deadly force only “when necessary in defense of human life.” That means there has to be an imminent threat of death or serious injury to the officer or another person. It’s a steeper standard than prosecutors apply now, which says the police can shoot when doing so is “reasonable.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Importantly, the bill also says the authorities must look at an officer’s conduct leading up to a shooting, including whether the police tried to first de-escalate the situation or use less lethal weapons. It’s an unusual provision and a reason the bill has widespread support from civil rights groups.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I couldn’t be more proud,” Mr. Newsom said last month when I asked what he thought of the compromise. “California will lead the nation.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the course of negotiations, lawmakers made concessions to law enforcement that prompted them to withdraw their opposition — but also caused Black Lives Matter to drop its support.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For more on the bill and a look at the scope of police shootings in California, read <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://calmatters.org/explainers/california-police-shootings-deadly-force-new-law-explained/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=nyt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">this explainer</a>, which CalMatters published today.
