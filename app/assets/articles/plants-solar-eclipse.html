When he heard an eclipse was coming, he saw the chance for “a once-in-a-lifetime data set.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Big sagebrush spends much of its life in the sun, and “it covers such a large portion of the country,” from Oregon down to New Mexico, Mr. Beverly said, making it a good subject for study. He and his colleagues chose a patch close to Yellowstone National Park. They set up instruments that could measure photosynthetic rate, as well as the speed of transpiration — how quickly its leaves lose water.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the light faded and the temperature dropped during the 80 or so minutes before totality, Mr. Beverly and his team saw a corresponding decrease in photosynthesis and transpiration. “The plant responded as if it was dusk,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the two minutes and 18 seconds of complete darkness, both rates fell further. Although they did not quite reach the slowdown level of an average nighttime, it was a much more precipitous drop than would have occurred for a passing cloud.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But when the sun appeared again, the shrubs were blindsided.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s when we saw the most evident signals of stress,” said Mr. Beverly. “It caused a disruption in the photosynthetic pathways.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although they could not test this directly, he guesses that the shock of sudden sunlight messed with each plant’s circadian rhythm — the internal clock that determines an organism’s daily cycle of activity.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the course of the eclipse day, the team estimated, your average big sagebrush managed about 14 percent less photosynthesis than it would have if the sun hadn’t been blocked. If a plant is already drought-stressed, an eclipse might be bad news, like “losing 14 percent of a day’s income when you’re already broke,” Mr. Beverly said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their findings follow a few other studies, including one done during an eclipse over Europe in 1999 that showed changes in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192302001260" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">sap flow</a> and transpiration in a beech tree near Ghent, Belgium. The tree <!-- -->“‘held its breath’ during the solar eclipse,”<!-- --> said Kathy Steppe, now a professor of plant ecology at Ghent University — meaning it stopped releasing water, even as its sap kept flowing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Beverly looks forward to the 2024 eclipse, which will sweep from Mexico through to the Eastern United States, when he plans to take a closer look at crop and tree responses.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He’ll do one thing differently: “I would try to use as much automation as possible so I could actually enjoy the eclipse,” he said. “That’s a big thing I missed.”</p>
