<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The White House has ordered a freeze on up to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/us/politics/foreign-aid-freeze-congress.html?searchResultPosition=8&amp;module=inline" title="">$4 billion</a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/us/politics/foreign-aid-freeze-congress.html?searchResultPosition=8&amp;module=inline" title=""> that Congress approved</a> for global health, United Nations peacekeeping and other foreign aid. Unless lawmakers can overcome a complicated legislative process and force a reversal by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, that money <!-- -->could<!-- --> be denied to programs fighting Ebola, promoting stability in Africa and countering extremism with a youth employment initiative in fragile nations like Jordan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once again, the administration is shrinking from peaceful engagement with the world. President Trump has gutted the diplomatic corps, and if Congress hadn’t stopped him, he would have <!-- -->slashed the State Department <!-- -->by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/18/opinion/sunday/the-trump-administration-is-making-war-on-diplomacy.html?module=inline" title="">as much as 30 percent</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This all worsens a decades-long trend by Democratic and Republican presidents of relying increasingly on military power to advance American interests.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The military accounts for <!-- -->more than half<!-- --> of discretionary federal spending. Since the attacks of Sept. 11, the counterterrorism wars have cost an estimated $5.9 trillion, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/figures/2018/budgetary-costs-post-911-wars-through-fy2019-59-trillion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the Costs of War project at Brown University</a>, thus adding to the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.axios.com/budget-deficit-billions-fiscal-year-2019-1e40f182-736f-474f-9a42-49b099eb407e.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ballooning national debt </a>with which future generations will have to reckon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But, fearful of being labeled unpatriotic, even lawmakers who question Pentagon spending usually end up supporting enormous budgets. As Congress argued over the defense budget this year, Democrats favored an increase to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2019/07/23/budget-deal-overpays-for-the-pentagon/#34dfc90891cb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">$733 billion from $716 billion while Republicans wanted $750 billion. They settled at $738 billion</a>, a near-record level. And even before the increase, the United States was spending more on defense than all of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pgpf.org/chart-archive/0053_defense-comparison" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">next seven countries</a> combined.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Allocations for the State Department and related agencies, on the other hand, were <!-- -->$56 billion<!-- --> before the White House moved to rescind the $4 billion. There are more people <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://medium.com/@teamwarren/revitalizing-diplomacy-a-21st-century-foreign-service-2d9d195698f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">working in military grocery stores</a> than there are diplomats.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">American foreign policy is overdue for a rebalancing, one that would curb military deployments in more than 100 countries and instead revive a more multidimensional approach to strengthen democracy and make the world safer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://warontherocks.com/2019/02/assessing-the-texas-national-security-reviews-progressive-and-conservative-foreign-policy-roundtables-is-there-a-new-consensus-forming/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">James Goldgeier</a>, a professor of international relations at American University, said that a recent roundup of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-the-future-of-progressive-foreign-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">progressive</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-the-future-of-conservative-foreign-policy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">conservative</a> views on reimagining foreign policy, in the Texas National Security Review, showed potential for a bipartisan consensus. It would be based, he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://warontherocks.com/2019/02/assessing-the-texas-national-security-reviews-progressive-and-conservative-foreign-policy-roundtables-is-there-a-new-consensus-forming/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said</a>, on “the growing belief among many progressives and conservatives that the United States should be engaged in fewer military interventions in the world, given the failures in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dov Zakheim, a top Pentagon official under President George W. Bush, rejecting Mr. Trump’s “purely transactional” foreign policy, <!-- -->wrote<!-- --> in the review that “a conservative middle way” would allow the United States to remain active in the world while being neither interventionist nor isolationist.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Loren DeJonge Schulman, deputy director of studies at the Center for a New American Security, <!-- -->wrote<!-- --> in the review: “There are alternatives to today’s counterterror strategy, and it would not be an insult to the military to debate them. It’s entirely legitimate to study whether the military is equipped to face today’s threats without being accused of retreating from the world or starting with an artificial budget cut.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president, who advocates bigger military budgets, has in the meantime been more supportive of a nuclear arms race than of arms control agreements. He has pushed for foreign arms sales and denigrated the United Nations, the World Bank and other international institutions that, however much they need reform, help manage disputes and regulate global relations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the United States needs a strong defense, it also needs to develop a national security strategy that doesn’t rely on limitless, sometimes wanton, military spending — the Pentagon <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/01/opinion/sunday/pentagon-spending-audit-failed.html?module=inline" title="">failed its first audit last year</a> — and that <!-- -->calls<!-- --> for restraint in deploying forces overseas. Such a strategy would also invest far more in diplomacy, development, economic justice, free and fair trade, nuclear nonproliferation and a reversal of climate change.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Such rethinking is gaining traction among some Democratic presidential candidates. Senators <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-11-29/foreign-policy-all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Elizabeth Warren </a>and Bernie Sanders have called for an end to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/opinion/americas-forever-wars.html?module=inline" title="">America’s endless wars</a>. Ms. Warren has proposed doubling the Foreign Service and the Peace Corps and opening new posts in underserved areas around the world, an approach worth considering. Mayor <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/buttigieg-foreign-policy-speech/591436/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Pete Buttigieg</a> of South Bend, Ind., a military veteran, has rejected conflicts with ill-defined missions, and former Vice President Joe Biden has<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://news-photos-features.com/2019/07/11/biden-gives-speech-on-foreign-policy-that-defines-his-quest-for-presidency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> said</a> the “use of force should be our last resort, not our first — used only to defend our vital interests, when the objective is clear and achievable and with the informed consent of the American people.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There’s no reason these could not be bipartisan goals.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
