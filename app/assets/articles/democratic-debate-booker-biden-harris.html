He was engaging and succinct and avoided the needless detail that many candidates went into. He won the face-off with Biden, including a funny line about Kool-Aid, and he also tried to stay focused on the real opponent: President Trump. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As I’ve said before, Booker <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/opinion/cory-booker-2020.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fdavid-leonhardt&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=13&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">deserves a hearing</a> as a top-tier candidate. You can listen to my recent interview with him, from “The Argument” podcast, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/opinion/the-argument-cory-booker-2020.html?module=inline" title="">here</a>, which includes a couple of my disagreements with him.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I was <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">less impressed with the performances of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden</strong>. Harris’s new health care plan was supposed to save her from having to defend the abolishment of private health insurance, and she fell back into the trap. Biden has a good case to make, but too often he didn’t appear sharp, struggled to find the precise word he wanted and almost seemed relieved when the moderators told him time was up. You can find my thoughts on each candidate <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/01/opinion/debate-winners-losers.html?module=inline" title="">here</a>, as well as those of other Times writers. Our consensus: Booker did best, and Bill de Blasio did worst.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I thought both of this week’s debates were <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">too long. </strong>Combined, they stretched to about five hours over two nights. The next rounds should be more compact.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">For more </strong>…</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/second-democratic-debate-night-two/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Nate Silver</a>, FiveThirtyEight: “My view at the start of the night was that Booker needed to differentiate himself in a positive way from Harris and I think he did that — not with any particularly interesting strategy or by taking her on directly, but just from being fairly sharp throughout the evening when she was quite uneven.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/01/dem-debate-gop-strategists-roundup-2-227496" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">David Polyansky</a>, former Ted Cruz adviser, in Politico: “Sen. Booker effectively drove his message straight down the middle — sounding competent, reasonable and passionate while balancing both what Democratic primary voters want to hear with what they probably need to hear.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/31/20749498/democratic-debate-climate-change-cory-booker-paris" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Umair Irfan</a>, Vox: “Booker made an uncomfortable but necessary point during the second Democratic primary debate: The bar for action on climate change is higher than it used to be, and pledging to rejoin the Paris climate agreement is too low of a bar for presidential candidates.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cnn.com/opinions/live-news/opinion-democratic-debate-night-july-31/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Paul Begala</a>, for CNN: “Biden spent far too much time deep in the weeds, critiquing Harris’ health care proposal. Harris responded by going even deeper, and their colleagues got even more obscure. You’ve heard of missing the forest for the trees?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/08/01/biden-performed-better-second-debate-cnn-didnt/?utm_term=.edd129d728ad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Jennifer Rubin</a>, Washington Post: “Biden turned in a solid performance, going a long way to silencing critics and reassuring supporters … Both [Biden and Harris] showed they were more capable of appealing to the party as a whole and to independents than the Warren-Sanders duo from Tuesday night.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1156735084445044736" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">David Frum</a>, of The Atlantic: “I voted against him twice, and *I* seem to have more positive things to say about the last Democratic president than these Democrats seeking to succeed him.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of the debate’s subjects was impeachment, and the chances of impeachment actually seem to have risen since Robert Mueller’s testimony last week.
