<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The bare, dusty ground is littered with rusty blades and crack pipes. The area reeks of urine and garbage. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At least three times a day, <!-- -->Charly Roué <!-- --> is drawn to this neighborhood, one of the most sordid in Paris, always following the same ritual<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After panhandling tens of euros at cafes not far from some of the most popular tourist spots, he heads to the northern edge of the city, where he can buy crack cocaine at La Colline, or the Hill, France’s largest open-air market <!-- -->for crack<!-- -->. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many of the drug users who come here day after day “compare La Colline to hell,” said Mr. Roué, 27, who has been using drugs on and off since he was 14. “The locals who live nearby and suffer from the chaos we bring must call it hell too.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">They do.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the past few<!-- --> years<!-- -->, La Colline, about five acres of desolate land squeezed between three highways at the gates of the city, has become the symbol of a drug crisis plaguing northern Paris as gentrification has pushed some of the capital’s most desperate populations to its farthest margins. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Local residents say the presence of drug <!-- -->users<!-- --> has made their lives unbearable, and local business owners say their revenues have plunged because customers have been scared away. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While this poor neighborhood has long had its challenges, residents say the crack<!-- --> market <!-- -->has made an already difficult situation significantly worse.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We had our share of burned cars, weed trafficking and prostitution,” said Rafia Bibi, a 59-year-old Tunisian woman who has lived in the area for the past 15 years, and who can see La Colline from her 17th-floor apartment. “But the violence and misery among migrants and drug addicts have made this neighborhood barely livable.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At La Colline, crack is available and on open display 24/7. Hundreds come every day to buy a smokable rock, known as a “galette” in French, for 15 euros, or about $17. Dozens of addicts live there in makeshift tents, mingling with the homeless migrants who also populate the area.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Every Tuesday, the police clear out the entire area and raze the makeshift slum. But it inevitably grows back a few hours later.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Drug users engage in prostitution in public toilets as children go to school in the morning, while fights occur daily, as traffickers sometimes beat one another with construction cables, or drug users fight over<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>galettes with pocket blades. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You can forget about the Paris of Woody Allen,” said <!-- -->a police officer<!-- --> who has patrolled La Colline every day for the past couple of years, referring to the director’s film “Midnight in Paris.”<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>“We couldn’t be further from that.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Emmanuelle Oster, the new chief police officer for the 18th arrondissement, which includes La Colline, said she had made the fight against crack her priority since she took office in November. She said that all 500 officers under her leadership were mobilized against it, and that over 300 traffickers had been arrested in the first six months of 2019, more than in 2018 over all.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An estimated 5,000 to 8,500 users smoke crack in the Paris area, a number that has been fairly steady over the years, though its use had long been a hidden problem. But it burst into public view, Ms. Oster said, when recent housing projects gentrified former squats, forcing users<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>into the open and turning “an invisible phenomenon into an apocalyptic situation.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That just can’t exist in a city like Paris in the 21st century,” Ms. Oster added.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The aid groups that come to La Colline to offer what help they can blame the heavy police presence for exacerbating tensions. But they don’t dispute that the concentration of users and addicts compacted into La Colline makes for an explosive situation. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On a recent afternoon, under the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/world/europe/heatwave-record-temperatures.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Filiana-magra&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=undefined&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=8&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">scorching heat that has plagued France this summer</a>, a few social workers with Charonne, an aid organization that gets city funding, distributed over 150 smoking pipes, dozens of condoms, hygienic towels and glasses of water. For many of those who wander there, the social workers’ presence is the only form of relief they can hope for.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The aid workers say many female addicts in La Colline have been coerced into prostitution, and at least half a dozen drug users have died there since the beginning of the year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We urge them to come see us in our offices so they can find some rest,” said Yves Bouillet, a social worker at Charonne. “But they say we’re too far from them,” he added about the group’s offices, two miles south. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The broader neighborhood in which La Colline sits, Porte de la Chapelle, has long marked one of the northern boundaries of Paris. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Eric Lejoindre, the mayor of the 18th arrondissement, which includes Porte de la Chapelle, said the authorities were “trying to unify the city with its outskirts.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Yet with everything we’re seeing at the moment, many think the Porte de la Chapelle doesn’t belong to Paris,” he acknowledged.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many local residents say they have <!-- -->adapted to the new normal<!-- -->, ignoring drug users and staying away from the insecurity they can bring. And they don’t want the neighborhood to be solely defined by its crack problem. Businesses are still there, they point out, and longtime residents still meet old friends at cafes, undeterred by the illicit trade around them.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the peak of Europe’s migration crisis <!-- -->in 2015<!-- -->, the neighborhood became a rallying point for those seeking refuge in France. The authorities built a temporary shelter there, but it was undersized and left hundreds more in the street. Many stayed after the shelter<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/paris/status/983692664880148480" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> was dismantled in 2018</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some have fallen into the trap of La Colline.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Crack is everywhere here, it’s impossible to escape from it,” said Nivmud Singh, a 34-year-old homeless man who arrived from India in 2016.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">City officials have vowed to open a “rest and health center” by this fall, as part of a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.paris.fr/actualites/lutte-contre-le-crack-un-plan-d-actions-2019-2021-6843" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">three-year anti-crack plan</a>. Backed by a budget of<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>€9 million, or about $10 million, the plan has funded organizations like Charonne and offered dozens of temporary housing options for users.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Drug users will also probably be able to smoke crack legally at the center, which would be a first for crack consumption in France.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Officials argue the neighborhood is going to change for the better and grow safer, with a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/universite/campus-condorcet/le-site-de-la-chapelle/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">future campus of Sorbonne University</a> and new infrastructure being built for the 2024 Paris Olympics.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet local residents remain angry that their representatives haven’t acted faster.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“After all we’ve been through, city officials want to let the drug addicts stay by setting up a drug room here,” said Toufik Aouchiche, a waiter at the family-owned Celtic cafe, whose terrace is often assailed by drug users. “But have they asked us what we think about it?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Roué, the addict, doesn’t plan to use the center.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The only way to stop smoking crack is to leave Paris,” he said. “We should all stay away from La Colline.”</p>
