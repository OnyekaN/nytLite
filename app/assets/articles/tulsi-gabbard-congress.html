<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who has remained in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination even as her bid has failed to gain much traction in polls, announced Friday that she would not seek a fifth term in Congress.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The announcement was likely to fuel speculation that Ms. Gabbard may be preparing for a third-party race for the White House, a prospect that has unnerved Democrats. Last Friday, Hillary Clinton suggested that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-hillary-clinton-russia.html?module=inline" title="">Republicans were “grooming” her</a> for such a bid, though Ms. Gabbard has denied any such plans.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.tulsi2020.com/updates/2019-10-24-mahalo-nui-loa?ms=tw191024&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=mahalo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">In a statement</a>, Ms. Gabbard cited her desire to become president as the reason for not seeking re-election to her current office, telling her constituents that she would “humbly ask you for your support for my candidacy for president of the United States.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Gabbard, whose noninterventionist views have set her apart from her party, said she was the best person to lead the nation at a time when “we may be sucked into another even more disastrous war in the Middle East, and tensions with other nuclear powers are escalating.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the crowded Democratic field, Ms. Gabbard has developed a small but devoted political following. She failed to qualify for the party’s September debate, but then met a 2 percent polling threshold for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-debate.html?module=inline" title="">the Oct. 15 debate</a>, where she assailed the news media for what she called biased coverage of her campaign.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Gabbard, 38, who served as a soldier in Iraq and is a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has made foreign policy the main focus of her presidential campaign, promising to get and keep <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard-2020-presidential-race.html?module=inline" title="">the United States out of foreign wars</a> if elected.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She has been a fierce critic of the Democratic Party, saying it “has become a warmongering party, a party that defends these corporate special interests and the establishment rather than being the party that is truly of, by and for the people.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Gabbard was facing a challenger for her seat in Congress: State Senator Kai Kahele, who has assailed the congresswoman for missing votes and ignoring the demands of her constituents as she pursues her presidential bid. </p>
