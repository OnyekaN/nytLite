<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BEIJING — The Chinese authorities have detained a journalist who was a leading figure in the country’s #MeToo <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/world/asia/china-women-me-too-censorship.html?module=inline" title="">movement</a> and had recently written about the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/world/asia/what-are-hong-kong-protests-about.html?module=inline" title="">antigovernment protests</a> in Hong Kong, her friends said on Thursday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The activist, Huang Xueqin, was detained last week in the southern city of Guangzhou, according to friends who asked not to be identified by name. The authorities accused Ms. Huang, 31, of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” a vague accusation that the government often uses to silence activists who challenge the status quo.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Huang is best known in China for her role in the country’s fledgling #MeToo movement, which achieved some success despite China’s authoritarian system. She helped dozens of women report cases of sexual assault and abuse online, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/world/asia/china-women-me-too-censorship.html?module=inline" title="">battling censors</a> and a male-dominated culture. The movement took on <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/world/asia/china-metoo-professor-sexual-harassment.html?module=inline" title="">professors</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/world/asia/china-zhou-xiaoxuan-metoo.html?module=inline" title="">television anchors</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/world/asia/metoo-china-monastery.html?module=inline" title="">religious leaders</a> and others.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’re not brave enough to stand out as one individual,” she said last year in an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/world/asia/china-women-me-too-censorship.html?module=inline" title="">interview</a> with The New York Times. “But together, we can be strong.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Huang is now also the latest mainland citizen known to have been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/10/03/china-release-supporters-hong-kong-protests" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">detained</a> for showing support for the Hong Kong protests. The ruling Communist Party has depicted the demonstrators as rioters seeking political revolution, and the police on the mainland have in recent months detained and questioned several citizens who have shared protest slogans online.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In June Ms. Huang published an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/2019/06/matters-%E9%BB%84%E9%9B%AA%E7%90%B4-%E8%AE%B0%E5%BD%95%E6%88%91%E7%9A%84%E5%8F%8D%E9%80%81%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%A7%E6%B8%B8%E8%A1%8C/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">essay</a> about her experience attending the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/09/world/asia/hong-kong-extradition-protest.html?module=inline" title="">first massive march</a> in Hong Kong against a bill, now withdrawn, that would have allowed the extradition of the territory’s residents to mainland China. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She wrote that she was attending the rally “with the intention of giving voice to, participating, bearing witness and recording history” and criticized the mainland’s restrictions on free speech when she learned that her social media posts about the protest had been censored. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her detention has raised concerns among human rights groups who have denounced a broad crackdown on dissent that China’s leader, Xi Jinping, has waged since rising to power in 2012. Dozens of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/23/world/asia/china-crackdown-human-rights-lawyers.html?module=inline" title="">lawyers</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/world/asia/china-journalists-crackdown.html?module=inline" title="">journalists</a> and activists have been detained and many have been sent to prison. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It only shows how fearful Chinese authorities are,” said Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, an advocacy organization. “They are afraid that protests in Hong Kong could inspire challenges to the government in the mainland, and that anyone expressing ideas of freedom of democracy is a threat to the Communist Party’s rule.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was unclear precisely why Ms. Huang had been detained, and the police in Guangzhou did not answer a call seeking comment. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since February, Ms. Huang, who also goes by Sophia, had been traveling to Taiwan, a self-governing island, and Hong Kong, where she had planned to attend law school in September, her friends said. Chinese leaders consider Taiwan part of China. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After she began chronicling her experiences in Hong Kong, the police on the mainland confiscated her passport in August and harassed her relatives, her friends said. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In that same June essay about Hong Kong, Ms. Huang spoke critically about the way that a Chinese state news outlet had depicted the protesters as being backed by Western forces. The protesters have dismissed such claims and asserted that they alone are demanding greater police and official accountability and universal suffrage. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Perhaps, under the powerful apparatus of the party-state, ignorance and fear can be cultivated, information and news can be shielded, and reality and truth can be distorted,” Ms. Huang wrote. “But when you personally experience what happened — witness it — you can pretend to be ignorant no more.”</p>
