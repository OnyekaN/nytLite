<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The metal detector at the Jackson County Detention Center in Kansas City, Mo., beeped repeatedly when Laurie Snell, a lawyer, tried to enter the facility on May 31.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She was passing through security on her way to visit a client, but something she was wearing was setting off the detector. She removed her shoes, her jewelry and her glasses. Then she realized the problem was her bra.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So Ms. Snell ducked into a bathroom, removed the undergarment and put it into a bin for the X-ray machine. That got her through security. Then, in the privacy of an elevator cabin, she wriggled back into the bra as quickly as she could.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Thankfully my client was on seven, which is the top floor,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Snell was among the first to point out that the metal detector at the detention center was reacting to women’s bras. She was not the last. Over the past two months, the issue has spawned a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://jacksonco.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&amp;clip_id=3721" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">legislative debate</a>, a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/jackson-county-attorneys-protest-new-jail-security-measures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">public protest</a> and a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://media.kansascity.com/livegraphics/2019/pdf/screening-policy-open-letter.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">deadlock</a> between a group of lawyers and the county authorities.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The standoff, nicknamed “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kcur.org/post/bra-gate-escalates-jackson-county-jail-doubles-down-universal-screening-policies#stream/0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Bra-Gate</a>,” echoed other episodes in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://fox43.com/2018/01/30/women-turned-away-from-visitation-at-lancaster-county-prison-after-wearing-underwire-bras/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Pennsylvania</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://bangordailynews.com/2017/03/06/news/state/maine-state-prison-bra-removal-policy-reversed-after-women-file-complaints/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Maine</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/detention-centre-visitors-say-they-ve-been-given-a-bizarre-bra-warning-20190712-p526qu.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Australia</a>, where bras have fueled similar debates over security, privacy and gender discrimination. In Kansas City, the situation took on additional legal significance when a lawyer announced on Friday that a sex discrimination complaint had been filed on behalf of a corrections employee.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The employee, Charlotte Hardin, is a legal librarian who removed her bra to pass through security. The lawsuit was filed against the county last month, after she was put on administrative leave, her lawyer said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is important to note that males are allowed to remove their belts and shoes and send them through the X-ray machine, then retrieve them and wear them in the secure perimeter,” her lawyer, Katherine Myers, said in a statement. “Yet females are not permitted to do the same with their underwire bras.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Diana Turner, the director of the Jackson County Corrections Department, said she could not comment on the complaint except to say that Ms. Hardin was not placed on leave for putting her bra through the X-ray.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She added that she could not understand the pushback against what she called a routine security measure. “We’ve got to take care of our staff,” she said. “We’re doing the best that we can with very limited resources in a jail that is grossly understaffed and overcrowded.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Jackson County Detention Center had <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://fox4kc.com/2018/05/11/grand-jury-releases-report-on-jackson-county-jail-conditions-demands-action-by-county-leaders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">reportedly been struggling with serious safety and security issues</a> when Sheriff Darryl Forté <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/JCSheriffOffice/status/1078761974748598273" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">took over administration of the jail</a> in January. A new policy in mid-May required everyone entering the facility — including lawyers with credentials — to pass through the metal detector.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Snell, the lawyer, said she accepted that decision but did not understand why security agents could not use a wand metal detector or a pat-down — as many airports do — to clear women who had set off the main metal detector.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Nobody is against security,” she said. “We’re just in favor of fairness.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Molly Hastings, a former public defender who is now a private lawyer, said she did not think the county was being discriminatory on purpose. “We have this unintended consequence of singling out women because of their undergarments,” she said. “This could have been addressed. It’s mind-numbing. I don’t know why we’re talking about it still.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Not every bra has the type of metal underwire that sets off the detector in Kansas City. Ms. Turner said that people passed through the detention facility’s detector more than 700 times a day on average, and that the vast majority of them had no problem at all.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We have never asked someone to remove their undergarments,” Ms. Turner added. “The recent conflict has been people trying to put undergarments into the X-ray bin, and we consider that unacceptable, because there’s no way it ends well for our agency with our screening officers having to handle undergarments.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wands were not a good option either, she said, because they could not differentiate between underwire and a contraband item. And she added that lawyers who cannot pass through the metal detector are still allowed to interact with their clients through plexiglass.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tracy Spradlin, a lawyer who regularly visits clients in the detention center, said that was not a fair option. “We cannot meaningfully exchange documents with them that way, and we cannot have free conversations,” she said, adding that the new policy disproportionately affects women in what is already a male-dominated field.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On June 12, dozens of lawyers opposed to the policy demonstrated in front of the Jackson County Courthouse in Kansas City. “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.kctv5.com/news/kansas-city-lawyers-chant-we-need-support-to-protest-bra/article_f8062320-8d63-11e9-90dd-034dc9ca2de8.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">We need support</a>,” they chanted. Some of their signs mentioned the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to a speedy trial — a nod to the fact that if female lawyers cannot get through security for in-person consultations, their clients suffer, too.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Neither Ms. Spradlin nor Ms. Hastings has had a problem getting through the metal detector, nor did they know how many women were affected in total. But Ms. Hastings said she knew of more than a dozen, and Ms. Spradlin pointed out that facility employees, whose paychecks depend on corrections authorities, might be reluctant to speak up if there were a problem.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Hastings said county officials have been incommunicative and resistant to even simple solutions, like implementing a second screening method.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The complete refusal to be reasonable — that’s just been mind-boggling,” she said.</p>
