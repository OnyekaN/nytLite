<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Yankees, with 36 games remaining and a 9½ game lead in the American League East, might seem like a team whose dominance has dulled the edges of a successful season. But there’s been more going on in the Bronx than calisthenics in preparation for October. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At stake, in the final six weeks of the regular season, is achieving the best record in the American League and home field advantage throughout the playoffs. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The reason for some anxiety should be obvious. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2017, when the Yankees lost to the Houston Astros in seven games in the league championship series, they were beaten four times in Minute Maid Park. The Yankees still rue Houston’s home field advantage to this day and wonder if the outcome might have been different had Games 6 and 7 not been played in front of a raucous Texas crowd. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The memory of squandering a 3-2 series lead is what drives the Yankees as the likelihood grows of another showdown between the two powerhouses.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That’s why the Yankees’ recent surge has been so significant: despite an 8-4 loss to the Cleveland Indians on Sunday, the Yankees won six out of eight in their homestand and 16 of their last 20, while opening up a four-game advantage over the Astros for best record. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Yankees slugger Aaron Judge says, “that’s the biggest thing right now” he means the Yankees’ 49-20 record in their own ballpark — the best in the majors. He spoke glowingly of “how rowdy this place gets and how crazy these fans are” and the Yankees’ belief that the Astros will struggle with the wall of noise, as they did two years ago. Houston lost all three playoff games in New York in 2017.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there are challenges ahead: the Yankees embark on a critical West Coast trip this week against the Oakland A’s, who have closed to within 6½ games of the Astros, and the Los Angeles Dodgers, the National League’s best team, before finishing the swing in Seattle. Judge said, “this will be a big test for us.” He meant that on several levels.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By the time they return home, the Yankees could be ready to raise the curtain on two critical assets to the pitching staff who have been injured, Luis Severino and Dellin Betances. Severino’s rehab from shoulder and latissimus dorsi muscle issues took another step forward before Sunday’s game, as he threw 15 pitches to three batters. It was the first time all year the right-hander had faced anyone. He expressed optimism about returning to the rotation by September.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It feels like it’s coming around,” Severino said. “The fastball is there, breaking pitches, too. I feel like I’m on the right track.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The next step for him will be a simulated game at the Yankees’ minor league complex in Tampa, followed by an appearance with one of the team’s minor league affiliates. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Barring any setback, the Yankees will have a healthy and fully-restored Severino for the final month of the season. That would be no small addition for a rotation that has lacked a bona fide ace since Opening Day. Any chance that C.C. Sabathia could have filled that void were dashed by his wobbly performance against the Indians on Sunday: he allowed four runs in three innings, giving Cleveland enough of a cushion to survive the Yankees’ two-run rally in the bottom of the ninth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although most of the Yankee Stadium crowd had already cleared out, those fans who remained were excited by the possibility of a comeback: the Yankees were within four runs, had runners on second and third with one out and Didi Gregorius and Gio Urshela, their Nos. 3 and 4 hitters, coming to the plate. But the rally turned out to be nothing more than a tease. Brad Hand, a lefty, struck out Gregorius on three pitches and got Urshela to line out to left to end the game.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The close call served only to underscore how the Yankees had been sabotaged by Sabathia’s rustiness. Nursing an arthritic knee, he was making his first start in nearly three weeks and admitted he was disappointed with his effort, especially the three-run home run he allowed Mike Freeman.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I really hung it up there,” Sabathia said of his slider. “I’ve been doing that a lot this year, especially to left-handed hitters. I have to tighten that up.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the vow, Sabathia has no illusions of turning back the clock. His E.R.A. stands at 5.01 and he says his knee remains as troublesome as ever. Even with the extended stay on the injured list and a platelet rich plasma injection, Sabathia admitted his pain-level, on a scale of one to 10, “was about an eight” during Sunday’s game. “Eight is as good as it’s going to get,” he said, for the rest of the season.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sabathia was no match for Mike Clevinger, who struck out 10 in five innings, and it remains to be seen how long the Yankees will stick with their veteran lefthander once Severino returns. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Manager Aaron Boone was being diplomatic when he said of Sabathia, “hopefully he can get into a good routine every fifth or sixth day and get on a good run” although the Yankees’ are facing a more pressing agenda: beating the Astros not just in October, but in the next six weeks, too.</p>
