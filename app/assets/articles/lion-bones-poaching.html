<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">An international treaty<!-- --> prohibits the buying and selling of products made from any of the big cat species, save one: the African lion. If the animals have been bred in captivity in South Africa, then their skeletons, including claws and teeth, may be traded around the world.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lion parts legally exported from South Africa usually wind up in Asia, where they are often marketed as tiger parts. This lucrative business is on the rise, and according to recent research a ban enacted by the United States may have helped to ignite it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service banned imports of captive-bred lion trophies. For many lion breeders in South Africa, skeleton exports <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217409" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">were an obvious way to make up for lost business</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Sometimes, you think you’re doing the right thing, but the outcome of your policy decision is that something worse materializes,” said Michael ‘t Sas-Rolfes, a doctoral candidate at University of Oxford in England who has studied the trade in lion bones.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Before the ban, South Africa’s breeding and hunting facilities housed over 8,400 captive-bred lions. Many were destined for use in “put and take” hunts in which a captive-bred, sometimes tame animal is released into a fenced hunting camp for a hunter to stalk and shoot.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For people short of money and time, these canned hunts, as they are commonly called, can be appealing. Compared to traditional hunts in the wild, canned lion hunts are cheaper, last days rather than weeks, and are guaranteed to produce a high-quality trophy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Americans once comprised at least half of the clientele for canned hunts. But animal-welfare advocates have long criticized the industry as rife with <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://conservationaction.co.za/media-articles/animal-cruelty-charges-laid-against-lion-farmer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">abuse</a> and lacking in any conservation value.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In December 2015, the United States <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.fws.gov/news/ShowNews.cfm?ref=endangered-species-act-listing-protects-lions-in-africa-and-india-&amp;_ID=35403" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">added lions to the Endangered Species List</a>, complicating the rules surrounding lion trophy imports. Although Americans were still free to shoot lions in legal hunts throughout Africa, they could bring home the trophy only if they proved that the hunt had benefited lion conservation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to the F.W.S., South Africa’s canned hunts do not meet the criteria.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. ‘t Sas-Rolfes and Vivienne Williams, a researcher at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, sought to determine how the American trophy ban and other policy changes <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0217409" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">had affected South Africa’s lion breeding industry</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://on.fb.me/1paTQ1h" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Like the Science Times page on Facebook.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> </em></strong><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">| Sign up for the </em><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://nyti.ms/1MbHaRU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Science Times newsletter.</em></a></strong><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></strong></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The researchers surveyed 117 facilities that bred, kept or arranged hunts of captive lions. Following the ban, Mr. ‘t Sas-Rolfes and Dr. Williams learned, prices for live lions plummeted by as much as 50 percent. Over 80 percent of respondents said that the ban had impacted their businesses, and many reported laying off staff and euthanizing lions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While most breeders said they had scaled back operations, about 30 percent said they had decided to turn to the international bone trade. Prices for skeletons have risen by more than 20 percent since 2012.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Female skeletons now sell for $3,100 on average, and those of males for $3,700. Skeleton exports more than doubled in the year following the American trophy ban, from 800 to 1,800 lions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Skeleton exports have since been capped. In late 2016, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species mandated that South Africa establish an annual export quota for captive-bred lion parts. In 2017, authorities set a quota of 800 skeletons; officials raised the figure last year to 1,500, but returned the quota to 800 following protests. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most sellers believe that the quota is still too low. Half of the respondents to the survey said they would seek “alternative markets” if quotas constrained their businesses. Frustrated sellers, in other words, threatened to turn to illegal trade.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lion bones already feed illegal markets. One early buyer, for instance, was Vixay Keosavang, a Lao national who formerly <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/04/world/asia/notorious-figure-in-animal-smuggling-beyond-reach-in-laos.html?module=inline" title="">headed a major wildlife trafficking syndicate spanning Africa, Southeast Asia and China</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">According to Dr. Williams’ earlier research, Mr. Keosavang <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.wildcru.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Bones_of_contention.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">accounted for nine of 16 consignments of 320 lion skeletons</a> sent to Laos in 2009 and 2010.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Keosavang went into hiding after the United States <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/world/asia/us-to-offer-reward-in-wildlife-trafficking-fight.html?module=inline" title="">offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his network’s dismantling</a>, but other buyers in Vietnam, Laos and Thailand quickly took his place. Intermediaries in those countries now act as go-betweens for customers, obscuring the true number of importers and their identities, Dr. Williams said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She and Mr. ‘t Sas-Rolfes did not investigate what became of lion bones after they were legally imported into Asia. But according to Debbie Banks, a campaign leader at the Environmental Investigation Agency in London, lion bones, teeth and claws are falsely labeled tiger parts and sold.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tiger products <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/05/science/animal-farms-southeast-asia-endangered-animals.html?module=inline" title="">are immensely popular in Asian markets</a>. Lion bones are used to make what’s marketed as tiger bone wine, a luxury, while claws and teeth are turned into jewelry. In at least eight wildlife seizures in China, lion parts were said to be tiger products, according to Ms. Banks and her colleagues.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There’s an assumption that lion has replaced tiger in the market, and therefore there’s a decline of pressure on tigers, but that’s not the case,” Ms. Banks said. “The demand for tiger and other big cats marketed as tiger is so huge that not only is it consuming farmed tigers, but wild tigers are also still being poached.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The legal trade in lion parts “stimulates demand and perpetuates the desirability of these products,” she continued. “So long as there is a demand, there is going to be pressure on the world’s remaining tigers.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a worrying new trend, lions are also falling victim to poachers. Over a five-year span, Kristoffer Everatt, a project manager at Panthera, a conservation organization, documented a 68 percent decline in the lion population in Limpopo National Park in Mozambique, with just 21 lions remaining in 2017.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The majority of the poached lion remains were missing teeth and claws; two were butchered for their bones, as well. “This lion population is now close to a complete collapse,” Dr. Everatt said. Researchers in Namibia and northern Mozambique have also reported finding lions with their faces, paws or toes removed, he added.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since 2016, Kelly Marnewick, a conservationist at Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria, has recorded at least 75 captive-bred lions that were poached. “It’s a bit of a McDonald’s drive-through,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You throw poisoned meat over the fence to lions used to eating from people, the poison kills them quietly, and then you go in and chop off body parts and leave without anyone noticing.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The increase in legal lion bone exports <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://bioone.org/journals/African-Journal-of-Wildlife-Research/volume-42/issue-1/056.042.0103/Possible-Relationships-between-the-South-African-Captive-Bred-Lion-Hunting/10.3957/056.042.0103.short" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">is connected to illegal poaching</a>, Dr. Everatt said: “It would be too coincidental for these two things to be happening at the same time and same place without a link. But the problem is, nobody has actually investigated it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Mr. ‘t Sas-Rolfes warned against jumping to conclusions. Researchers are still examining whether and how demand for legal big cat products affects the poaching of tigers and lions, he said. A new ban on lion bone exports may not only fail to curb poaching, but worsen it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Williams believes that only scientifically informed compromise will yield a solution that truly benefits wild lions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Different stakeholders will vigorously claim there’s only one side and here’s what we need to do, but this is a Rubik’s Cube of complexity,” she said. “It’s multi-sided, and everything is interconnected.”</p>
