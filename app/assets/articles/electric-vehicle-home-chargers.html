<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Formula E racers used to swap out cars when their batteries were drained, but that’s hardly an answer for your daily commute.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And while additional high-tech roadside charging facilities will make <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/business/energy-environment/electric-cars-charging.html?module=inline" title="">electric driving more practical</a>, it’s the availability of convenient home charging equipment that persuades many vehicle buyers to go electric.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Home is the main charging location for most E.V. owners,” said Gil Tal, director of the Plug-In Hybrid and Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis. “Even in California, more than half of the E.V. owners are not using any out-of-home charging infrastructure. They are O.K. with just plugging in at home.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over 80 percent of electric vehicle owners charge at home, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/electricvehicles/charging-home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> Energy Department says</a>, adding that “charging in a single-family home allows you to take advantage of low, stable residential electricity rates.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Three methods of charging cars’ lithium-ion batteries are in use: Level 1, using a standard 110-volt outlet; Level 2, an upgrade to a 240-volt outlet; and DC fast-charging, which uses direct-current electricity. However, owing to the high cost and complexity of DC equipment, home use is typically kept to Levels 1 and 2.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Level 1 charging, with the plug-in cord that is standard on electric vehicles, can replenish the battery of some limited-range electrics and hybrids — like the Chevrolet Volt or Fiat 500e — overnight.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For cars with larger batteries, Level 1 is painfully slow. That category includes models with a range of over 200 miles, like the Chevrolet Bolt, the Nissan Leaf Plus, the Kia e-Niro, the Hyundai Kona Electric, the various Teslas, and most coming models. Charging a depleted battery for these would require days.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Level 2 devices, at 32 amps, can add about 25 miles of range per hour. Thus, a depleted 60-kilowatt-hour Bolt battery can typically be fully charged in 10 hours. A drained Tesla 100-kilowatt-hour battery will take about 14 hours.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Level 2 charging requires aftermarket equipment that operates on 240-volt AC household current, like some air-conditioners or other large appliances. A 32- to 40-amp charger sells for about $600, with feature-laden smart chargers topping $1,000. Portable chargers that provide about 16 amps of current are offered for less than $300, but as amperage and price go down, charging time goes up.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Level 2 chargers meant for outdoor installation are hard-wired to a 240-volt source. That will add $500 or more to the cost. Chargers for indoor use can be plugged into a 240-volt outlet. This might be the best choice for an owner with a 240-volt outlet in the garage, but installing one will cost about as much as hard-wiring a charger to the breaker box.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most electric vehicle owners don’t drive over 200 miles on a normal day, so the battery isn’t fully drained by evening. In that case, refilling it on a Level 2 charger can take just a few hours. If the daily commute is only 20 miles and that mileage is rarely exceeded, the Level 1 plug-in might suffice, as would a portable 16-amp Level 2 charger. It gets easier if the office provides some charging stations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Level 2 chargers for home installation are compact, and most have an 18- or 25-foot charging cord, so the vehicle doesn’t have to be parked next to the unit. More expensive Level 2 smart chargers can be switched on or off with a cellphone and programmed to charge when electricity rates are lowest, though many electric vehicles now come with firmware and apps that offer similar abilities with a basic charger.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked what improvements in home charging we might see in the years to come, Mr. Tal said Level 2 technology was reasonably mature. However, he does anticipate a market for chargers powered by solar panels that generate DC current, no complex inverters needed.</p>
