Bolaji has lived in the same room for more than a decade, sharing a communal bathroom with his neighbors, for $166 a year in rent.</p><p>To learn how the scammers operated, Jack infiltrated Facebook and Whatsapp groups where they swapped tips and stolen photos. Many of the Facebook groups were public, and the scammers would post invitations to join the Whatsapp groups. Members shared advice and offered services, like Photoshopping images to use in new scams</p><p>To interview scammers on camera about their activities, we visited internet cafes in Lagos, Nigeria, where local journalists helped us make connections. In some cases, we convinced shop owners our story was important enough to let us talk to their customers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Daniel Anonsen </strong>works on a commercial diving team aboard a ship in the Gulf of Mexico. Fortunately, he said, his online reputation did not prevent him from getting the job. But he still worries that someday he’ll meet a woman who was scammed using his photos. “If I was on the receiving end of that,” he said, “that’d be open license to walk up and approach him: ‘Why are you doing this? Where you been?’” He added, “I think about it regularly when I’m out.” He has no plans to ever return to Facebook and Instagram, though plenty of his impostors are still there.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Akinola Bolaji </strong>said he has given up impersonating others online. “I can’t tell my children that I’m living by fraud,” he said. Instead, he messages women with his real Facebook profile, hoping to find a relationship that can help him escape Nigeria. It has been difficult. “They’ll never believe you when they know you’re a Nigerian,” he said. He introduced Jack via video chat to a Texas woman he called his girlfriend.

The company said it has used software to block billions of fake accounts over the past year.
