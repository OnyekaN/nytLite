<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BOSTON — Dangerously hot temperatures are expected to spread across the Central and Eastern United States on Wednesday through the weekend, with temperatures soaring above 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the hardest-hit places, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.weather.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">National Weather Service</a> has warned. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And even when the sun dips below the horizon, temperatures in many places are expected to remain in the 80s.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Everyone living in the region stretching from northern Oklahoma and central Nebraska through Iowa, Missouri and western Illinois should brace for a “prolonged period of dangerously hot temperatures and high humidity,” the warnings say. People in central and south central Kansas should expect to endure highs of about 102 degrees; the temperature in Des Moines was expected to hover around 100.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Excessive heat warnings</a> have also been posted farther east, for parts of New Jersey, Delaware and Pennsylvania. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">All told, at least 15 million people across the United States are currently being warned of dangerously high temperatures that could affect human health between Wednesday and Friday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By the weekend, what meteorologists are calling a “<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/heat-dome.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">heat dome</a>” in the middle part of the country is expected to spread into the Great Lakes and the East Coast. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The combination of heat and humidity can take its toll on someone who is outside and overdoing it,” said Richard Bann, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center. “It can be life-threatening.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last year, 108 people died from extreme heat, compared to just 30 who died from cold, according to statistics on weather-related fatalities released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here are four safety recommendations from the National Weather Service:</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Drink plenty of fluids. </strong> </p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Stay in an air-conditioned room.</strong> </p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Stay out of the sun.</strong></p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Check on relatives and neighbors</strong>, especially the elderly. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So far, Philadelphia is the only major city on the East Coast under an excessive heat warning. Meteorologists are predicting highs there of 100 degrees. But New York, Washington and Boston are expected to be uncomfortably hot, with temperatures soaring into the high 90s and above; Chicago can expect the same.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Saturday’s expected highs are 97 in Boston, 100 in Washington and 98 in New York.
