<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">LONDON — The video, dark and grainy, shows a man identified as Prince Andrew of Britain standing in a doorway and waving goodbye to a young woman, then giving a look around before quickly shutting the door.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The footage was<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7367511/Prince-Andrew-pictured-inside-paedophile-Jeffrey-Epsteins-63million-mansion-depravity.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> published </a>on Sunday by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7367511/Prince-Andrew-pictured-inside-paedophile-Jeffrey-Epsteins-63million-mansion-depravity.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Daily Mail</a>, a British tabloid, which says it was taken in December 2010 at a mansion in New York City owned by Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile who <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/17/nyregion/epstein-suicide-death.html?module=inline" title="">hanged himself in his jail cell</a> this month. At the time, Mr. Epstein was a registered sex offender.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buckingham Palace issued a statement Monday saying that the prince was “appalled” by the allegations against Mr. Epstein and rejecting any suggestion that the prince would take part in the “exploitation of any human being.” The statement did not challenge the authenticity of the video.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behavior is abhorrent,” the statement said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The palace does not usually comment on sex scandals, but this was the second statement it issued this month amid repeated scrutiny of Prince Andrew and other global figures who socialized with the disgraced billionaire.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is not the prince’s first brush with scandal.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the years, the second-born son of Queen Elizabeth II has come under criticism for his associations with Mr. Epstein. In 2011, he resigned under pressure from his post as Britain’s trade envoy after a photograph was published showing the two men walking together in Central Park. Prince Andrew later acknowledged that their friendship had been a mistake.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That same year, Stephen Day, the former head of the British Foreign Office’s Middle East section, wrote a letter to the heads of three government departments questioning the prince’s performance as trade envoy. He cited a number of troubling relationships the prince maintained, such as one with family members of the corruption-riddled government of the ousted Tunisian president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the letter, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=wm#inbox?projector=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published in The Daily Telegraph</a>, Mr. Day complained that the prince’s activities made it seem as though the British government “is content to work closely with dodgy fixers and politicians.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Several days before Mr. Epstein’s death, new allegations against Prince Andrew spilled out in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/nyregion/epstein-sex-slave-documents.html?module=inline" title="">a cache of court documents </a>unsealed by a court in Manhattan. These included the accusation that he touched a young woman’s breast while sitting on a couch inside Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan mansion in 2001.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The documents also include a photograph of Prince Andrew with his arm around the waist of Virginia Giuffre, who claims that Mr. Epstein paid her to have sexual encounters with the prince when she was 17 years old.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buckingham Palace has repeatedly denied the claims, which were first made by Ms. Giuffre in 2015.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This relates to proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party,” a spokeswoman for the palace said in a statement last week. “Any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Prince Andrew and Mr. Epstein became friends in the late 1990s after being introduced by Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, who was Mr. Epstein’s girlfriend at the time. Through the years, Mr. Epstein hosted the prince at his New York mansion and several of his holiday homes including in Palm Beach, Fla., <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/18/private-jets-parties-and-eugenics-jeffrey-epsteins-bizarre-world-of-scientists" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Guardian has reported</a>. Prince Andrew also hosted Mr. Epstein at various royal residences, including Windsor Castle.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since coming back into the spotlight over the Epstein scandal, the prince has kept a low profile at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where the queen spends her summer holidays. Last week he was photographed smiling with his mother as they traveled to church together.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the weekend the prince was spotted at a resort in Spain with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, the Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported. In 2011, the duchess was criticized for accepting $18,000 from Mr. Epstein to pay off her debts. She apologized and said accepting the money was a “gigantic error of judgment.”</p>
