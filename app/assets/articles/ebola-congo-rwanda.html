<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One year ago, the World Health Organization declared an outbreak of the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo after the deadly disease was discovered in the country’s North Kivu Province.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the months since, the virus has continued to spread — two weeks ago, the outbreak was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/health/ebola-outbreak.html?module=inline" title="">declared a global health emergency</a> — with more than 2,600 people infected and over 1,800 killed, according to W.H.O., making it the second-deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, Congolese health officials confirmed four cases of Ebola and the first active transmissions of the disease after two more people linked to a man who had died of the disease become infected in Goma. The city of more than two million people is a major transit and trading hub that thousands of people pass through each day. The city borders Rwanda, which temporarily shut the border crossing there on Thursday as fears of the disease heightened.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Experts warn that the disease’s spread could get worse. How did the outbreak get to this point, where does it stand now and what comes next? Here’s what you need to know.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Congolese Health Ministry and Doctors Without Borders confirmed that two more people had contracted Ebola in Goma, a day after officials said that a man there had died of the disease. He was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/world/africa/congo-officials-say-second-ebola-case-confirmed-in-city-of-goma.html?module=inline" title="">the second person confirmed as having</a> Ebola in the city.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The man’s 1-year-old daughter and wife were widely reported to have contracted the disease. The confirmation of the first active transmissions of the virus in Goma was a situation that the health authorities had long feared.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The International Rescue Committee, which has been working in the country to provide aid to those affected, said the spread of the disease showed the need to scale up the response in and around Goma.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“With confirmed transmission of the Ebola virus to the daughter of the second patient who died earlier this week, we’re seeing the first active transmission chain in Goma and expect more to come,” Andre Heller, the organization’s Ebola response director, said in a statement.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">About 20 people who came in contact with the man have been identified and would be vaccinated against the disease, the United Nations <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://news.un.org/fr/story/2019/07/1048741" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said in a statement on Wednesday.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The World Health Organization also released a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/31-07-2019-at-1-year-mark-we-mourn-the-lives-lost-and-call-for-solidarity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">joint statement</a> with other United Nations organizations on the eve of the anniversary of the outbreak, expressing concern about the newly infected people in Goma.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This latest case in such a dense population center underscores the very real risk of further disease transmission, perhaps beyond the country’s borders,” the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/31-07-2019-at-1-year-mark-we-mourn-the-lives-lost-and-call-for-solidarity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> statement</a> said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Goma borders the Rwandan city of Gisenyi, where workers and traders from both sides cross daily. Photos and videos of the sealed-off border were <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/rbarwanda/status/1156861140384829447" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">posted on social media</a> on Thursday from Goma.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/SMupfuni/status/1156889876949884928" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">lamented the rising price of goods on the Rwandan side</a> as traders were blocked from bringing their goods to market on Thursday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A Rwandan government official confirmed to The Associated Press that the border was temporarily closed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rwanda’s Health Ministry later described the closing as a “slowdown” after “measures were put in place to reinforce screening procedures and public safety at entry points,” but it maintained that the border was open.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The ministry said in the statement that screenings had been carried out at the crossing since the Ebola outbreak began, and recent infections in Goma had made further screening necessary.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This Ebola outbreak was first confirmed last August in the northeastern part of Congo, an area embroiled in a conflict between rival militias, making combating the disease especially difficult.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the fighting rages, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/world/africa/congo-ethnic-violence-ebola.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FEbola&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=inline&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=9&amp;pgtype=collection" title="">hundreds of thousands</a> have been displaced, raising concerns that the outbreak would spread to areas that have not previously been exposed to the virus.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The attempts to fight the disease have been complicated by the country’s unraveling security and misinformation and distrust among the public. A <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/health/ebola-africa.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FEbola&amp;module=inline" title="">political power struggle</a> between the government and the Health Ministry has only exacerbated the problem.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Violence against health care workers is widespread, and dozens have been killed or injured since the outbreak began in 2018. Treatment centers have been set on fire, complicating the administration of an effective vaccine.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The outbreak is second only to the outbreak that began in 2014 in West Africa, which left more than 11,300 people dead as the virus spread quickly among multiple countries.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nearly one in three of those infected by the virus in the current outbreak are children, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United Nations and the World Health Organization are “working intensively” to halt any further spread of the disease, according to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://news.un.org/fr/story/2019/07/1048741" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a joint statement</a> released on Wednesday, by David Gressley, the United Nation’s Ebola emergency response coordinator, and Dr. Ibrahima Socé Fall, the assistant director general for emergency response at the World Health Organization. But, the statement said, the infections in Goma show that more must be done.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the Merck Ebola vaccine has been in use in Congo, this spring the World Health Organization announced plans to introduce<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/health/ebola-vaccine-congo.html?module=inline" title=""> a new vaccine strategy to battle the outbreak.</a> It would involve vaccinating a larger population, rather than just those known to have come in contact with an infected person, and introducing an additional vaccine.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition, the locus of control over the country’s response to Ebola has shifted from the Health Ministry to to a panel that reports directly to the office of the presidency.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The health minister of Congo, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/health/ebola-africa.html?module=inline" title="">resigned last week</a> after the political infighting, but he wrote in his resignation letter that he had stepped down “to give all the chances for success to the newly designated team.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has about 15 employees in Congo now — 12 in Goma and the rest in Kinshasa, said Dr. Henry Walke, director of its division of preparedness and emerging infections, at a news briefing on Thursday. But there are no C.D.C. experts in the epidemic hot zones. Because of violence in those areas, the United States Department of State has not allowed the C.D.C. to deploy its staff there.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The C.D.C. played a much larger role in the West Africa epidemic, sending hundreds of experts to heavily affected areas, Dr. Walke said. He said the agency would double its staffing in Goma and Kinshasa within the next month, and would send people into epidemic zones if the security situation improved and the State Department allowed it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The C.D.C. has also sent two experts to Rwanda, four to South Sudan and four to Uganda to prevent the spread of the disease to those countries.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Regional preparedness measures are also underway. Rwanda has an Ebola treatment center at the ready, though no cases of the virus have been confirmed there. About 3,000 health workers in high-risk areas of the country have been vaccinated as a preventive measure, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1239901/retrieve" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">according to the World Health Organization</a>, including more than 1,100 in Gisenyi.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Uganda has also undertaken similar measures. In June, the country became the first to experience the spillover of Congo’s Ebola outbreak, when <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/unicef-launches-swift-response-first-ebola-cases-and-deaths-confirmed-uganda" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a 5-year-old Ugandan boy contracted the disease</a> during a visit to Congo. He and his grandmother died and at least one more of the boy’s close relatives became infected.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite the struggle to contain the virus, the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/31-07-2019-at-1-year-mark-we-mourn-the-lives-lost-and-call-for-solidarity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">World Health Organization appeared hopeful</a> in its Wednesday statement.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The challenges to stopping further transmission are indeed considerable,” it said. “But none are insurmountable. And none can be an excuse for not getting the job done.”</p>
