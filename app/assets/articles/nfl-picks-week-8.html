<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Drew Brees is likely to come back for New Orleans after five weeks away and Patrick Mahomes has yet to be ruled out by Kansas City despite dislocating his kneecap just last week. The Packers and the Saints — with Brees or without him — will look to continue their hot streaks, while the Patriots and the 49ers will try to stay undefeated. And don’t forget about the Bills, whose defense has them 5-1, with their only loss coming against New England. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here is a look at N.F.L. Week 8, with all picks made against the point spread.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Last week’s record: 5-9</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Overall record: 58-47-1</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Packers at Chiefs</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">8:20 p.m., NBC</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Packers -4 | Total: 48</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Surely the Chiefs (5-2) would not risk further injury by rushing Patrick Mahomes back just a week after he dislocated his kneecap in Kansas City’s win over Denver. The idea that a team would rush back such a valuable asset would go against the risk-averse nature of nearly all of pro sports in 2019.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And yet: Mahomes took fourth-team snaps in Wednesday’s practice and moved up to the second-team on Thursday. There is no question that the Chiefs’ relevance rests squarely on the shoulders of its third-year quarterback, but even with his aggressive practice schedule, the general assumption is that Mahomes will sit this game out before attempting a return against Minnesota in Week 9. The team has yet to make any official announcements, but Mahomes could be ruled out as early as Friday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Provided that is the way things play out, this game heavily favors the visiting Packers (6-1). Green Bay is coming off its best game of the season — a 42-24 destruction of the Raiders — with Aaron Rodgers becoming the first player since 1991 to record five passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown in the same game. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The scary thing for Green Bay’s opponents is how confident both Rodgers and Coach Matt LaFleur were that a big day was coming.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I want five today,” Rodgers was filmed saying to LaFleur after his first touchdown pass.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“That’s the goal,” LaFleur responded. “Hey, I want six.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kansas City’s defense is softer against the run than it is against the pass, but Rodgers in prime time is a force regardless of opponent. Even with Davante Adams unlikely to play, the Packers should be able to run up the score for a second consecutive week — which would be a welcome sight for Packers fans after Rodgers had occasionally looked tentative in Green Bay’s first six games under LaFleur. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Chiefs played valiantly after Mahomes’s injury last week, stretching what had been a 10-6 lead at the time of the incident to a 30-6 final score thanks to a pair of defensive touchdowns and one beautiful pass from Matt Moore that hit Tyreek Hill in stride for a 57-yard score. But after this game Kansas City is likely to be 4-0 on the road, but just 1-3 at home. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Packers -4</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Panthers at 49ers</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">4:05 p.m., Fox</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: 49ers -5.5 | Total: 42</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It may take an extremely heavy dose of Christian McCaffrey making plays as both a runner and a receiver for the Panthers (4-2) to upset the 49ers (6-0). San Francisco’s terrific defense has <!-- -->allowed fewer than 100 <!-- -->passing yards in three consecutive weeks and an average of just 10.7 points a game this season. That should make life incredibly difficult for Kyle Allen and Carolina. But McCaffrey, who is having a dominant season as an all-purpose back, at least gives the Panthers a fighting chance. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> 49ers -5.5</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Browns at Patriots</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">4:25 p.m., CBS</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Patriots -13 | Total: 46</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It has been nearly a month since the Patriots (7-0) won a game by fewer than 21 points. It has been 10 months — 12 consecutive wins, including the postseason — since New England lost a game. A road game for Baker Mayfield and the Browns (2-4) is no way for Cleveland to get its season back on track, and a betting pool could be created just to predict how many turnovers Mayfield might commit and when he might commit them. Cleveland’s results have been all over the place this season, making it hard to predict from week to week, but there’s a decent chance the Browns keep this game closer than 13 points, even if a win is a long shot. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Browns +13</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Cardinals at Saints</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">1 p.m., CBS</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Saints -10.5 | Total: 49</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Coach Sean Payton has made it clear that quarterback Drew Brees will be a game-time decision in his long-expected return from a thumb injury. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/JeffDuncan_/status/1187107491395624962" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Brees joked with reporters </a>on Wednesday about how the call will be made, saying he’ll determine if he can be himself, at which point, “I’ll tell Sean, and he’ll believe me.” The Cardinals (3-3-1) have won three straight, but even if Teddy Bridgewater were to start in Brees’s place, New Orleans would be the favorite. But the uncertainty of it all makes a double-digit point spread a bit of a coin flip. If Brees plays and is his usual self, 10.5 points should be easy. If Bridgewater starts, a far narrower win should be expected. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Saints -10.5</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Eagles at Bills</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">1 p.m., Fox</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Bills -1.5 | Total: 43.5</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Eagles (3-4) have lost consecutive road games, managing just 10 points against Dallas and 20 against Minnesota, neither of which has a defense as sturdy as the Bills (5-1). Philadelphia has more offensive firepower than Buffalo does, but with game conditions in Orchard Park expected to be cool and rainy, the home team — which can run the ball effectively with its choice of Devin Singletary, Frank Gore or even the team’s quarterback, Josh Allen — should be expected to grind things out. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Bills -1.5</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Bengals at Rams</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">1 p.m., CBS</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Rams -13.5 | Total: 48</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a little ridiculous for the Rams (4-3) to claim they were back after a blowout win over lowly Atlanta, but a win is a win. Victories tend to come even more easily against the Bengals (0-7), whom the Rams are favored to beat by two touchdowns. While Los Angeles is capable of covering in this game at Wembley Stadium in London, it is instructive to note that only two of Cincinnati’s seven losses have been by more than 10 points. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Bengals +13.5</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Raiders at Texans</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">4:25 p.m., CBS</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Texans -6.5 | Total: 51.5</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Texans (4-3) were a good team last year but succeeded with narrow margins in most games. Changes on defense have led the team to drop from fourth in scoring defense last season to 18th this year, and that has resulted in Houston struggling to stay over .500. The ever-accommodating Raiders (3-3) are here to help. Fresh off a dismantling by Aaron Rodgers and the Packers, Oakland may have just as much trouble with Deshaun Watson and the Texans. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Texans -6.5</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Jets at Jaguars</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">1 p.m., CBS</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Jaguars -6 | Total: 41</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Poor Sam Darnold was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/sports/football/sam-darnold-ghosts.html?module=inline" title="">seeing ghosts</a> on Monday as the Jets (1-5) were obliterated by New England’s top-tier defense. While that loss effectively erased the memories of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/sports/football/sam-darnold-return-jets.html?module=inline" title="">Jets’ win over Dallas</a> the previous week, this game might play out in similar fashion: with both teams trading touchdown drives. The Jaguars (3-4) are rightly favored at home despite their lack of consistency on defense and their offense thriving only in bursts, but those flaws should lead to an outcome that is closer than 6 points. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Jets +6</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Giants at Lions</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">1 p.m., Fox</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Lions -7 | Total: 49.5</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At some point, Daniel Jones is bound to have a bounce-back game — if he doesn’t, the Giants (2-5) are truly in trouble — and this game is setting up for that to happen. The Lions (2-3-1) are in a funk that does not seem to be easing up: Detroit has lost three straight, traded away safety Quandre Diggs for a draft pick and lost running back Kerryon Johnson to a knee injury, and it is likely to be without cornerback Darius Slay, who tried to play through a hamstring injury last week and exacerbated it. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Giants +7</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Seahawks at Falcons</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">1 p.m., Fox</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Seahawks -5.5 | Total: 52.5</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There is at least a little uncertainty for how this game will play out based on the status of Matt Ryan’s injured ankle, but it is not as if the Falcons (1-6) were looking great even with their quarterback healthy. The Seahawks (5-2) are undoubtedly smarting from being outplayed by Baltimore last week and should be happy to face a team that is nowhere near as good. <!-- -->But if Ryan plays<!-- --> — even a reduced version of Ryan — Atlanta <!-- -->should not be such a large underdog<!-- --> at home. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Falcons +5.5</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Broncos at Colts</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">1 p.m., CBS</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Colts -6 | Total: 43.5</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Broncos (2-5) cannot be as bad as they were in their humiliating loss to Kansas City: Denver was blown out despite Matt Moore’s replacing quarterback Patrick Mahomes for much of the game. Trading away wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders doesn’t help things on the field, but might in the locker room, where he had become a distraction. If Denver’s defense can rattle Jacoby Brissett, this could at least be a narrow loss rather than an embarrassing one. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Broncos +6</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Buccaneers at Titans</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">1 p.m., Fox</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Titans -2.5 | Total: 45.5</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ryan Tannehill looked terrific starting for the Titans (3-4) in a win against the Chargers, and he will have to carry the offense again this week. The Buccaneers (2-4) are a heavily flawed team, but one of their major strengths is stopping the run. Tennessee has a knack for finding a way to win, especially at home, and Tampa Bay has a knack for finding a way to lose, especially on the road. A close game should be expected, but asking the Titans to win by a field goal is reasonable. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Titans -2.5</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Chargers at Bears</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">1 p.m., Fox</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Bears -3.5 | Total: 40.5</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It has been nearly a month since either of these teams won a game. The Chargers (2-5), though, have more reason to be frustrated after blowing an easy opportunity to beat Tennessee last week, when they had multiple tries from the 1-yard line for a game-winning touchdown and could not punch the ball in. The Bears (3-3) followed a dominant win over Minnesota in Week 4 with two humbling losses, but should get back on track with a win at home. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Bears -3.5</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Dolphins at Steelers</strong>, <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">8:15 p.m., ESPN</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Line: Steelers -14.5 | Total: 43</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It’s tough being a laughingstock, but the Dolphins (0-6) would be forgiven if they were a little upset at being two-touchdown underdogs this week after a decent performance — by their standards — last week against Buffalo. And it is not like the Steelers (2-4) have been setting the league on fire, even if they should get a boost on offense from the return of Mason Rudolph at quarterback. There’s no reason to think the Dolphins can win this game, but they might lose by only 10 or 12. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pick:</strong> Dolphins +14.5</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Based on the idea that Minnesota wouldn’t need to flex much to win, we picked <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/sports/football/nfl-week-8-redskins-vikings.html?module=inline" title="">Redskins +16</a>. That is how it played out, with the Vikings playing a fairly uninspiring game, yet still winning easily, 19-9. After three consecutive weeks of 300 more passing yards and a rating in excess of 130, Kirk Cousins was held to 285 yards and a rating of 112.3. The star of the game was Dalvin Cook who rushed for 98 yards and added 73 more as a receiver. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A quick primer for those who are not familiar with betting lines: Favorites are listed next to a negative number that represents how many points they must win by to cover the spread. Patriots -13, for example, means that New England must beat the Browns by more than 13 points for its backers to win their bet. Gamblers can also bet on the total score, or whether the teams’ combined score in the game is over or under a preselected number of points.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Bye weeks: Dallas, Baltimore.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">All times are Eastern.</p>
