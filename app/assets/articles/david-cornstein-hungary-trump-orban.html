<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">BUDAPEST — The annual Independence Day celebration at the United States Embassy in Budapest is usually a modest garden party, a chance for the ambassador to celebrate American freedom, democracy and the rule of law.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This year, the ambassador, David B. Cornstein, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a blowout gala for 800 guests. He flew in the singer Paul Anka from California. The guest of honor was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/europe/viktor-orban-hungary.html?module=inline" title="">Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary</a>, who has curtailed the very freedoms the event was meant to highlight.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Standing at a lectern, Mr. Cornstein declared Mr. Orban “the perfect partner” and “a very, very strong and good leader.” Mr. Anka serenaded the Hungarian leader with a personalized rendition of “My Way.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For many in the room, it was a bewildering spectacle: an American ambassador lavishing praise on a far-right leader whose party has methodically eroded Hungarian democracy and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/world/europe/orban-hungary-antisemitism.html?module=inline" title="">pushed anti-Semitic tropes</a>. But it was just another demonstration of Mr. Cornstein’s pattern of emboldening Mr. Orban.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since becoming ambassador in June 2018, Mr. Cornstein has assiduously courted Mr. Orban, giving the Hungarian leader unexpected influence in the Trump administration. Mr. Cornstein used his decades-long friendship with President Trump <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/world/europe/orban-trump-hungary-white-house.html?module=inline" title="">to help broker a coveted Oval Office meeting for Mr. Orban</a> last May — a meeting now under scrutiny by impeachment investigators in Washington.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At the time, some White House officials tried to stop the meeting, citing Mr. Orban’s anti-democratic record in Hungary and his growing closeness to Russia. The meeting went ahead, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/us/politics/trump-ukraine-orban.html?module=inline" title="">Mr. Orban is said to have used it to fuel the president’s suspicions about Ukraine</a>. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As yet, Mr. Cornstein’s role in that meeting does not appear to be part of the impeachment inquiry. But <!-- -->his freewheeling diplomacy and courtship of Mr. Orban have alarmed <!-- -->career civil servants<!-- --> and contributed to broader criticism, even among Republicans, that some members of the president’s foreign policy team are <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/politics/gordon-sondland-intelligence-risk.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage" title="">dangerously unprepared for the job</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the past year, Mr. Cornstein, an 81-year-old jewelry magnate, has developed unusually close relationships with Mr. Orban and his advisers, according to several American and Western officials. He exchanges text messages with them, occasionally from personal devices, and boasts about his contacts — even as American security officials warn that Mr. Orban is trying to manipulate him.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He has undermined efforts by career diplomats to deliver messages to Washington about corruption and democratic backsliding in Hungary. And <!-- -->he has privately acted as a broker for Mr. Orban’s point of view, taking positions contrary to United States policy<!-- -->, according to interviews with roughly two dozen current and former American and foreign officials as well as others who have worked with Mr. Cornstein.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He has also adopted some of Mr. Orban’s talking points on Ukraine, contradicting the policy of the United States and its NATO allies.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some embassy officials were so taken aback that, according to two American officials, they confided to a recent congressional delegation that Washington’s top man in Hungary acted more like Mr. Orban’s top man in the Trump administration.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In two interviews, Mr. Cornstein played down concerns about Hungarian corruption, anti-Semitism and the erosion of democracy. He defended his approach as good for the United States, and said that his outreach to Mr. Orban was exactly what Mr. Trump wanted. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Hopefully there are one or two people who think I’m doing a good job,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump seems pleased. Although the Obama administration sought to isolate Mr. Orban <!-- -->as punishment for his authoritarian tendencies<!-- -->, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/world/europe/hungary-us-orban-trump.html?module=inline" title="">the Trump administration has engaged him uncritically</a>, a strategy intended to keep the Hungarian leader from drifting toward China and Russia.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Thomas Carothers, who studies democracies for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Mr. Cornstein’s public praise for Mr. Orban had gone too far. “The ambassador has crossed the line, both in openly endorsing bad things and mocking serious issues,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Privately, Mr. Cornstein has gone even farther.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In April, a group of congressional staff members visited Budapest on a trip sponsored by the Hungarian government. Realizing that Hungarian officials would present a rosy picture, American diplomats squeezed in a 45-minute briefing about corruption and the erosion of democracy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cornstein arrived unannounced and <!-- -->commandeered<!-- --> the meeting, saying he saw no evidence of corruption, according to several people in attendance.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Before I could start, Cornstein interrupted,” said Miklos Ligeti, a former official at the Hungarian Ministry of Justice who was asked to discuss corruption on behalf of Transparency International. “He came in and hijacked the meeting.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cornstein also spoke glowingly of Mr. Orban’s unchecked power. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He’s got the executive. He’s got the legislature. And he’s got the judges,” Marta Pardavi, a lawyer with the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, recalled the ambassador as saying. “He actually said it. And he said it so we would hear it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. <!-- -->Ligeti<!-- --> said he was never able to deliver his corruption briefing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Cornstein is the worst, most detrimental of diplomats — not just of the United States, but of all the countries,” Mr. Ligeti said. “He is actively working against the voices of anticorruption.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In interviews, Mr. Cornstein said he did not recall the meeting but played down corruption concerns.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Is there corruption <!-- -->in <!-- -->Hungary? I’m sure there is,” Mr. Cornstein said. “Is there corruption in New York City and Chicago? I’m sure there is.” He said he had seen no evidence of an effect on American businesses.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://hu.usembassy.gov/corruption-harms-us-heres-can-op-ed-u-s-department-states-luis-e-arreaga/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">State Department</a> and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.csce.gov/sites/helsinkicommission.house.gov/files/20190405%20Dalibor%20Rohac%20for%20web.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">private analysts</a>, however, say that corruption is persistent in Hungary. Secretary of State Mike Pompe<!-- -->o has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://hu.usembassy.gov/remarks-by-secretary-of-state-pompeo-and-foreign-minister-szijjarto-at-a-press-availability/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">pledged to increase support for anti-corruption efforts in Hungary</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It may not seem obvious how, or why, a Hungarian prime minister would influence the views of an American president toward Ukraine, an American ally. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Mr. Orban has been locked in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/05/world/europe/ukraine-hungary-ethnic-languages.html?module=inline" title="">a dispute with Ukrainian officials over a language law</a> that he says is discriminatory to ethnic Hungarians in Ukraine. The dispute has become a key security issue for the United States because Mr. Orban has blocked Ukrainian engagement with NATO. The United States is adamant that such disagreements should have no bearing on NATO security matters.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The White House meeting gave Mr. Orban the opportunity to press his case directly to Mr. Trump. Asked on Tuesday what Mr. Orban told the president about Ukraine, Mr. Cornstein replied, “It was between two men, and neither person discussed the subject with me.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Mr. Cornstein’s statements on the topic have recently drifted toward Mr. Orban’s point of view. Asked about Ukraine in an interview, he raised the language law unprompted. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The language law that was passed, which was not favorable to the 175,000 Ukrainian, former Hungarian people that are living in that part of the country, was something that I didn’t agree with,” Mr. Cornstein said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cornstein also took Mr. Orban’s side over <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/world/europe/soros-hungary-central-european-university.html?module=inline" title="">the fate of Central European University</a>, an accredited institution that Mr. Orban forced from the country. The Hungarian-born philanthropist George Soros founded the school <!-- -->after the collapse<!-- --> of the Soviet Union, in part to educate a new generation on the principles of human rights and the rule of law. As he eroded democratic norms, Mr. Orban <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/26/world/europe/soros-orban-hungary-eu-central-european-university.html?module=inline" title="">attacked Mr. Soros</a>, portraying him as part of a global conspiracy against the prime minister.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Publicly, Mr. Cornstein declared that saving the school was a top priority. But privately, he helped broker the university’s exit, according to the school’s president, Michael Ignatieff. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Ignatieff said that Mr. Cornstein had proposed that the school move its American degree program to Vienna and keep a smaller, Hungarian-only program in Budapest.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What do you care where your degrees are issued?” Mr. Ignatieff recalled Mr. Cornstein as saying.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“David, that’s not a compromise,” Mr. Ignatieff replied. “You’re kicking a U.S. institution out of Hungary.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I don’t see it that way at all,” Mr. Cornstein said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The university soon lost its authority to issue American degrees and moved to Vienna — the very outcome Mr. Cornstein had mentioned. The United States Embassy said in a statement that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://hu.usembassy.gov/press-statement-central-european-university-ceu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">the government was “</a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://hu.usembassy.gov/press-statement-central-european-university-ceu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">disappointed</a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://hu.usembassy.gov/press-statement-central-european-university-ceu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">.”</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The university’s expulsion was another example of Mr. Orban’s vast influence over Hungarian political life. His party, Fidesz, has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/world/europe/hungary-orban-media.html?module=inline" title="">cemented control of the media</a>, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/world/europe/viktor-orban-hungary-ivanyi.html?module=inline" title="">curtailed religious freedom</a>, endorsed <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://www.miniszterelnok.hu/prime-minister-viktor-orbans-speech-at-the-annual-general-meeting-of-the-association-of-cities-with-county-rights/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">racial and cultural purity</a> and used anti-Semitic stereotypes to attack the European Union. (<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/HUNGARY-2018-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">State Department reports</a> have cited Mr. Orban’s utilization of anti-Semitism.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cornstein, who is Jewish, often says that Hungary’s biggest problem is public relations and that Jews in Hungary have little to worry about.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They’re content. They’re happy and they’re safe,” he said. “I can’t say that about New York City.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Other American presidents have been accused of supporting strongmen. But Mr. Trump has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/world/asia/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-rodrigo-dutert-kim-jong-un.html?module=inline" title="">broken with a half-century of bipartisan consensus</a> that supporting freedom was a moral imperative and a security goal, said Larry Diamond of the Hoover Institution, a conservative research group. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Orban has quietly and skillfully, with velvet gloves, strangled the life out of democracy,” Mr. Diamond said. “To embrace and normalize and look away from these transgressions in a country that <!-- -->is in the heart of the liberal democratic project of the world is not only disturbing. It’s alarming.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Friends say that Mr. Cornstein, an affable grandfather, is a Rockefeller Republican, not an ideologue. He has donated not only to the presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and John McCain, but also to Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Cory Booker. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He did not give money to Mr. Trump’s campaign, but the friendship between the two men goes back decades. Mr. Cornstein attended Mr. Trump’s wedding and ran New York City’s off-track-gambling operation in the mayoral administration of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who is now Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cornstein <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/10/nyregion/public-lives-he-d-buy-the-otb-himself-if-he-could.html?module=inline" title="">made his fortune operating jewelry counters inside department stores</a>, and he often recounts stories of hard-won wisdom from his business career. Running an embassy is a lot like running a jewelry counter, he says: You can’t forget you’re in someone else’s store.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Some American official<!-- -->s <!-- -->and<!-- --> Western diplomats <!-- -->say that Mr. Cornstein is falling for a Hungarian campaign to undermine veteran foreign policy officials. At the White House, for example, Mr. Orban told <!-- -->Mr. Trump that the embassy in Budapest — staffed by career civil servants — was full of Obama administration holdovers<!-- -->, according to Mr. Cornstein and other American officials.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Trump responded by asking why Mr. Cornstein had not fired them. (In an interview, Mr. Cornstein said he had confidence in his staff.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cornstein is open about his closeness to Mr. Orban. He tells how, on the flight back to Budapest after the White House meeting, the two men — exhausted from a long day — stripped to their underwear and napped and chatted on couches in the back of Mr. Orban’s plane.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Mr. Cornstein learned recently that Radio Free Europe, the pro-democracy American news outlet, was preparing to return to Hungary, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/world/europe/radio-free-europe-hungary-orban.html?module=inline" title="">he sought assurances that it would not criticize</a> Mr. Orban’s government. In an interview, he said he simply wanted to ensure that the government viewpoint would be included. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is hardly unusual for diplomats to seek ties with foreign leaders, but Mr. Cornstein has eschewed both the rigorous prep sessions that normally precede high-level contacts and the detailed briefings that follow. State Department officials say they often do not know what messages are exchanged.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cornstein acknowledged that he rarely speaks to officials in Washington. He conceded that he has used personal devices to contact Mr. Orban and his advisers, but said he had done so a half-dozen times at most, and only to set up meetings. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I was told this before I got to the post: ‘This is your show. You run it,’” he said. “I know what the president’s philosophy is and what his foreign policy is.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cornstein has delivered mixed results, at best. He regards as an achievement negotiations that are underway, but not finalized, for Hungary to buy more than $1 billion in American weaponry.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet Mr. Orban has also allowed an obscure Russian financial institution, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/world/europe/hungary-russian-bank-spy-orban-putin.html?module=inline" title="">the International Investment Bank, to open in Budapest</a> with sweeping diplomatic immunity — a move that Western security officials say enables Russian spying and money laundering. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After a Drug Enforcement Administration <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.direkt36.hu/en/tobb-sebbol-verzett-az-oroszok-kiadatasi-kerelme-amivel-elhappoltak-az-usa-elol-a-magyarorszagon-elfogott-fegyverkereskedoket/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">sting captured two men thought to be Russian arms dealers</a>, Hungarian officials extradited them to Russia, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.direkt36.hu/en/szabadlabon-az-orosz-fegyverkereskedok-akiket-a-kormany-az-usa-helyett-moszkvanak-adott-ki/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">where they were set </a><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.direkt36.hu/en/szabadlabon-az-orosz-fegyverkereskedok-akiket-a-kormany-az-usa-helyett-moszkvanak-adott-ki/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">free</a>. Hungary has also snubbed Washington by saying that <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-telecoms-5g-huawei/hungary-has-no-evidence-of-huawei-threat-plans-rapid-5g-rollout-minister-idUSKCN1TL2AP" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">it sees no evidence</a> that the Chinese telecom giant Huawei is a security threat.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Cornstein said that building bridges was a process, one that will help the United States. He denied honoring Mr. Orban at the Independence Day gala.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My motivation was to really show what a great party can be,” he said, “and have people walk out and say, ‘Man, America really did that terrific.’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said the party cost about $320,000, financed mostly by American businesses. An additional $7,000 came from an embassy account used to establish local contacts.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the interview, Mr. Cornstein appeared to nudge American policy in another new direction. He said he had vehemently opposed the Russian bank’s relocation but that Mr. Orban had made private promises that have allayed his concerns.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I am comfortable with where we are now,” Mr. Cornstein said. Pressed on whether that was the official view of the United States government, he replied: “You’ve got to ask Washington. I’m comfortable.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The embassy quickly clarified his remarks, saying the ambassador considered the bank a threat as long as it remained in Hungary. </p>
