<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Imagine that 90 percent of all people living with H.I.V. were diagnosed and treated with drugs. Would that be sufficient to end the AIDS epidemic?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Scientists tried to answer the question i<!-- -->n three enormous studies published on Wednesday<!-- --> in the New England Journal of Medicine. <!-- -->Instead of simply urging people to get testing and treatment for H.I.V., health workers in five African countries went door to door, or set up mobile sites, offering tests for H.I.V., tuberculosis and other diseases to everyone in certain communities<!-- -->.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Anyone who tested positive for the infection was set up with clinic appointment to receive antiretroviral drugs. Then investigators assessed whether these efforts made any difference in the number of new H.I.V. infections in those communities.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Results from three of the studies suggest that the strategy comes nowhere near bringing the rate of new infections with H.I.V., or incidence, down to zero. But all of the studies showed that incidence dropped by about 30 percent, and one found a decrease in H.I.V.-related deaths.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Some of us were hoping for a higher reduction in incidence,” said Dr. Carlos del Rio, who heads the scientific advisory board at the <!-- -->President’s<!-- --> Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, which helped fund the studies. “But at the same time, it’s not trivial. A 30 percent reduction in incidence is pretty dramatic.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Worldwide, there were roughly 38 million people living with H.I.V. in 2018. <!-- -->The epidemic continues to ravage Africa: About 26 million people on the continent have H.I.V., of whom just 16.5 million receive drug therapy. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One of the new studies, called <!-- -->Ya T’sie<!-- --> (a reference to teamwork in the Setswana language), <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812281" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">focused on 15 pairs of villages in Botswana</a>, while a second, called Search, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1809866" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">examined 32 rural communities in Kenya and Uganda</a>. The largest of the three studies, PopART, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1814556" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">looked at 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Together, the studies cost more than $200 million and included nearly 1.5 million people. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The scale and scope of these studies is remarkable,” said Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, an H.I.V. expert at Columbia University in New York and leader of a group that helped fund <!-- -->PopART<!-- -->. “This is public health research at its best.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a bid to slow the epidemic, the United Nations set <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/909090" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“90-90-90” targets for the year 2020</a>: diagnose 90 percent of people infected with H.I.V.; treat 90 percent of those diagnosed with antiretroviral therapy, regardless of disease stage; and keep the virus suppressed in 90 percent of those who are treated.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If this strategy were carried out successfully, it would leave nearly three-quarters of infected individuals with such low levels of H.I.V. in their blood that they would be unable to infect anyone else. The new studies were the first to try the so-called universal test-and-treat approach, and all of them surpassed the 90-90-90 targets.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Each study was designed differently, but broadly speaking, the teams randomized entire communities to receive either the standard of care for that country, or some combination of <!-- -->treatments, including testing for H.I.V., TB and sexually transmitted infections; counseling; condoms; prenatal care; and voluntary medical circumcision.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Each study arrived at roughly the same 30 percent figure for the drop in incidence. Given the studies’ size and complexity, however, the details are not straightforward.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A key finding from all three studies was the importance of a “warm handoff”: Community health workers made sure that everyone who tested positive for H.I.V. showed up at a clinic for treatment. They called or texted people to remind them of their appointments, and escorted them to clinics if necessary.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Some people for so many reasons don’t show up,” said Dr. Shahin Lockman of Harvard University, who led Ya T’sie. “They’re scared, they’re not ready, they’re worried, they’re busy.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A lack of follow-up may explain why another trial, called TasP, found no effect on H.I.V. incidence. That study, funded by the French government and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29199100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published last year</a> in The Lancet, was conducted in KwaZulu Natal in South Africa and did not meet the treatment targets.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Linkage to care was the critical weakness in TasP,” said Dr. Gilles Van Cutsem, an adviser to the medical charity Doctors Without Borders, who was not involved in the newer studies. “That is the most difficult part to achieve.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Given the scale of the three new studies, the researchers expected their analyses to be complex. But the teams also faced unexpected snags.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2013, when the trials began, the standard of care in those countries was to offer antiretroviral drugs only to H.I.V.-infected people with a CD4 count — a measure of certain immune cells in the blood — of 350 or less. (The range for a healthy person is 500 to 1,500.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By 2016, however, the countries all began offering universal treatment — that is, antiretroviral drugs to anyone who is H.I.V. positive, regardless of CD4 count — although not universal testing. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The change was good for patients, of course, but made it difficult, and perhaps even unnecessary, to assess the benefits of universal treatment. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The switch had the biggest impact on PopART, which split its 21 communities into three groups: one received universal testing and treatment, while the second got universal testing but treatment according to local guidelines. The third group held to local guidelines for both testing and treatment. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once the countries switched to universal treatment, however, the first two groups “were essentially identical,”<!-- --> said Dr. Richard Hayes, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, who was a co-leader of PopART. “When we originally designed this study, we never expected that to be such a rapid change.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Despite both groups being identical, only the second showed a 30 percent drop in H.I.V. incidence <!-- -->— a result that has so far stumped the researchers. (The first group showed a 7 percent decrease, but that was not a statistically significant result.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Oh my God, talk about a weird finding,” said Dr. del Rio. “I don’t know. I don’t know what to make of it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While they attempt to solve the mystery, Dr. Hayes and his colleagues have opted to combine the results from both the first and second groups and reported a cumulative drop in incidence of 20 percent.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Search study also had its share of problems. That team’s approach included tests even for chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension, and the investigators saw a 32 percent decrease in H.I.V. infections.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the comparison group also showed a similar drop — perhaps because the researchers also offered the full testing package even to people in that group, said Dr. Diane Havlir of the University of California, San Francisco, who led the study.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the team saw a 23 percent decrease in deaths from H.I.V., and 59 percent decrease in TB infections among people with H.I.V. Testing for a range of diseases is helpful and realistic, Dr. Havlir said, because it reduces stigma and makes it easy to enroll patients in care for many conditions.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“If you’re not just doing it for H.I.V. and you’re committed to building care for these other diseases, it’s a shared cost,” she said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In all of the new studies, health workers had the most trouble reaching men and young people for H.I.V. testing. Some of the teams tried setting up tents and camps near farms, taxi ranks, schools and sports events, and operated them even on weekends and evenings. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Men go from having a pediatrician to having a geriatrician, that’s been a consistent finding in global health,” said Dr. Del Rio. “It also shows where we need to put a lot of our efforts.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But those efforts are unlikely to be <!-- -->carried out on <!-- -->anywhere near the scale of these new studies, partly because of the expense, and because universal treatment has already become the standard.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“These are all really important studies, but never again will they be performed,” Dr. Del Rio said. “Because the world has changed, we will not see this again.” </p>
