<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The most famous shoe print in the world is not on this world at all. It’s on the moon, probably still there in the gray dust.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin took a step forward, backed up, then took a photograph. What he left behind on the moon and captured for the rest of us on Earth remains remarkable in its simplicity and timeless in its evocation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Framed in the photo was evidence of man on the moon,” Mr. Aldrin later wrote in <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey9qaUExkAwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=magnificent+desolation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjguZP5vavjAhWDEHwKHduiC-MQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=magnificent%20desolation&amp;f=false" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Magnificent Desolation.</a> “A single footprint, showing in perfect detail a reverse mold of the treads from the bottom of my moon boot.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Aldrin’s footprint is about an inch deep — enough to cast a shadow from the dim sunlight over his right shoulder. It is straight on the sides and rounded at the toes and the heel, the shape of a racetrack. It is filled with lines, like rungs of a ladder, formed by eight flat, straight-edged ribs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Who created such a historic sole? Who decided that straight, thick ribs are exactly what an astronaut needs for traction in the lunar soil? </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A man named Richard Ellis is the person who captured the perfect blend of form and function. More than anyone, he decided what all the footprints on the moon would look like.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Ellis worked as a model maker for ILC Industries, now <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ilcdover.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ILC Dover</a>, the Delaware company that won the bid to create spacesuits for NASA’s Apollo program. ILC, best known for its Playtex division, also had military contracts for things like inflatable rafts.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Part of Mr. Ellis’s job was to take the 80 measurements of the astronauts so that engineers could design their suits. His lasting contribution, however, came from the blue silicone soles of the lunar overshoes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most called them moon boots. They slipped over the shoes worn in the spaceship, like galoshes for the rain.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It wasn’t something that NASA dictated, ‘You have to make the tread look like this,’” said Bill Ayrey, a retired ILC test engineer and longtime company historian. “It was him thinking, ‘What kind of tread would it be? Well, let’s do it like this, with full lines across, and that should keep you from slipping.’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“<!-- -->Moon Boot<!-- -->,” a book by David H. Mather about the design, suggests that the sole’s wide ribs were meant to accommodate the ladder rungs of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-the-apollo-lunar-module" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">lunar module</a>, but Mr. Ayrey doubts it. It is more likely, he said, that Mr. Ellis, who worked for ILC for 25 years and died in 2006, just chose to make his job easier.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Maybe Richard’s approach was, ‘I have to make this mold, and I’m going to make it simple, and it probably works fine,’” Mr. Ayrey said. “And it did. It worked just fine.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The tread was no afterthought of shoe design; in the 1960s, soles had become a focus of footwear fashion. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.chucksconnection.com/history1.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Converse made its first All Star basketball shoe</a>, with its complex rubber-sole pattern meant to stick to hardwood, about 50 years before Apollo 11. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In the 1930s, Vitale Bramani designed the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://us.vibram.com/company/about/history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Vibram sole</a>, the “waffle stomper” still popular with hikers and climbers. A trip to any shoe store would have provided Mr. Ellis or ILC and NASA engineers with assorted options to imitate.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there were caveats. Before the Apollo missions, NASA had photos but no soil samples from the moon. The agency was not sure what kind of surface the men would be walking on. Was it deep? Was it slippery? Would it shift like sand or clump like clay? </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In case the lunar soil turned out softer than they anticipated, they wanted something that would spread the weight of the astronaut on a pretty large footprint,” said Cathleen Lewis, the curator of spacesuits and international space programs at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Neil Armstrong took his first step on the moon (soon trampled by subsequent ones), he clung to the ladder. No one was sure how stable the surface was, or if it “would be like quicksand, literally sucking a person down into a quagmire of dust,” Mr. Aldrin wrote. He discovered it was like “powdered charcoal,” and noted that he could create footprints and make out the treads.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So could everyone else.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though moon boots had a calf-high upper, made of layers of woven stainless steel and high-tech fabrics, which went through several redesigns, the rubber soles and their raised, protective toe barely changed through the entirety of the Apollo program.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Only the last two men to walk on the moon, Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt of Apollo 17, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/boot-left-lunar-overshoe-cernan-apollo-17-flown" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">brought theirs back</a>. Other used boots remain on the moon, left behind to save room and weight for return voyages. Mr. Armstrong and Mr. Aldrin tossed their boots from the hatch, like children dumping muddy shoes to the porch.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They probably went much further than a normal toss given the one-sixth gravity,” Ms. Lewis said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The moon boots inspired a generation of off-the-shelf imitators, made mostly for snow. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.tecnicasports.com/usa/company/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Tecnica quickly introduced Moon Boots</a>. A plethora of cheap foam boots followed. Their thick rubber-soled, soft-upper influence is still seen in all-weather gear by brands like <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.sorel.com/About-Us_History.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Sorel</a> and in snowboard boots by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.burton.com/us/en/c/mens-snowboard-boots" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Burton</a> and others, not to mention Chanel.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But the treads they leave on Earth never match the ones on the moon. Which raises the question: If, someday, humans create a lunar outpost, what will the bottom of our shoes look like?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Would Nike and Adidas fight to get a swoosh or three stripes imprinted into the lunar soil? Would Carhartt or L.L. Bean bid to create a tread design solely for the moon’s environment? And would the boots work on Mars?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It is hard to imagine that any would equal the original footprints left on the moon 50 years ago.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The footprint ties into Neil Armstrong’s statement when he stepped out onto the surface — ‘one small step for man,’” Ms. Lewis said. “It’s a reminder that humans were there, that humans explored. And it’s still there.”</p>
