<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WASHINGTON — As the federal government inches closer toward a potentially disastrous default on its debts, lawmakers and some Trump administration officials desperate for a budget deal have carefully maneuvered negotiations away from the man who has emerged as the common enemy: Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Mulvaney made his name in the House as an ardent opponent of federal spending, even willing to risk a default crisis to secure deep budget cuts. But in the coming days, Washington must come together to raise the government’s statutory borrowing limit before the Treasury Department runs out of money to pay its bills, possibly in early September, and raise spending caps to stave off across-the-board spending cuts scheduled to sweep through the government next year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To do it, congressional negotiators from both parties have elevated Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, at Mr. Mulvaney’s expense.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Mulvaney is one of the people who shut down government because they didn’t want to lift the debt ceiling, and so he has no credibility on the subject whatsoever,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the past week, Ms. Pelosi has spoken to Mr. Mnuchin on the phone at least five times, sometimes multiple times a day, and the conversations have prompted cautious optimism among lawmakers that a deal can be reached before the House is set to leave next week.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are understanding each other,” Ms. Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday, after she and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, spoke with Mr. Mnuchin for about 30 minutes. “We would like to have something on the floor next Thursday.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Mnuchin, speaking on CNBC on Thursday, said that the pair had agreed on how much to raise both domestic and military spending over the next two years as part of a two-year debt ceiling increase. Left up for debate is how to offset some or all of the new spending and what Mr. Mnuchin called “certain structural issues.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I don’t think the markets should be concerned,” he said. “We’re working hard, we’ll get there one way or another.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since Congress emerged bruised and battered in January from <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/08/us/politics/government-shutdown-calendar.html?module=inline" title="">a record 35-day shutdown</a>, lawmakers have been eager to avoid a budgetary breakdown. They have been blunt about their distrust of Mr. Mulvaney, a founder of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus whose political career was shaped by crusading against the type of deal the White House and Congress are now seeking. Senior officials on Capitol Hill involved in the budget talks describe him alternately as a “problem child” or a “troublemaker” or just “not helpful.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A former congressman from South Carolina, Mr. Mulvaney came of age politically during the Tea Party movement, helped orchestrate a government shutdown during the Obama era and has expressed doubts about what virtually all economists say would be the dire consequences of defaulting on government debt. Giving him a seat at the budget talks, lawmakers say privately, is like putting an arsonist at the table to establish a fire prevention plan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is a man who never voted for an appropriations bill,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. “He doesn’t bring a great deal of credibility to it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, prefers to note Mr. Mulvaney’s presence in the room — “He was there,” he said after one meeting — before pivoting to the importance of having Mr. Mnuchin doing the talking.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wall Street analysts are also watching Mr. Mulvaney warily. Henrietta Treyz, the economic policy director at Veda Partners, a market analysis firm outside Washington, wrote in a note to clients this week that the threat of a presidential veto and Mr. Mulvaney’s hawkish views were the most significant risks to a deal falling apart.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In contrast, Mr. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood film producer, tends to be the Trump administration’s voice of moderation, willing to compromise to reach a deal. Last month, Mr. Mnuchin emerged from a meeting in Ms. Pelosi’s office to tell reporters that the White House was not looking for a shutdown fight or flirting with a debt limit default. Mr. Mulvaney stood, red-faced, to his left, waiting for a chance to interject.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When the Treasury secretary stopped speaking, the acting chief of staff jumped in, charging Ms. Pelosi with having raised her spending demands and asserting — incorrectly — that she had promised to raise the debt ceiling no matter what, a shift, he insisted, from her previous position.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I shouldn’t even be engaged in a conversation that has him mischaracterizing,” Ms. Pelosi later said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">By no means has Mr. Mulvaney been completely shut out: A White House official said that on Tuesday, Mr. Mulvaney participated in a meeting with the president about the debt ceiling. And two administration officials said that Mr. Trump’s lack of interest in the talks meant that the acting chief of staff could dip in and out of the discussions, sticking to the big picture without getting sucked into the minutiae.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At times, he has privately expressed bemusement at what he calls Mr. Mnuchin’s naïveté when it comes to haggling with Congress. In the spring, when Mr. Mnuchin suggested that House Democrats would be amenable to a “clean” raising of the debt ceiling — without preconditions, like raising the spending caps — Mr. Mulvaney insisted that Ms. Pelosi would surely try to extract concessions — as he would have.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He is likely to be proved right.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And Mr. Mulvaney certainly sees himself in charge. At a Heritage Foundation forum on Wednesday, Mr. Mulvaney said that he often joked that the White House budget office was now under the conservative think tank’s management.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But two administration officials acknowledged that Mr. Mulvaney’s diminished role in the budget negotiations could be in response to the bipartisan contingency on Capitol Hill that does not want him there. Mr. Mulvaney was seen poorly by those legislators, White House officials suggested, because they want to spend more than he does.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Like Ms. Pelosi, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has also singled out Mr. Mnuchin as the preferred lead negotiator among the three administration officials — Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Mulvaney and the acting budget director, Russell T. Vought — who have traipsed up to the Capitol in recent weeks for talks.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“By all accounts, Secretary Mnuchin is very outcome driven and that’s what this is about,” said Antonia Ferrier, a former top aide to Mr. McConnell. “He’s uniquely positioned to work this through, because he’s dispassionate, he listens, he’s respected and he’s not playing games.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Aides to Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney say that the two men have a constructive working relationship, but that their backgrounds, ideologies and negotiating styles starkly differ. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said, “The president has confidence in his team and the progress that is being made.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At times they have knocked heads: Last year, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney clashed over who would have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/us/politics/trump-tax-cuts-treasury-omb.html?module=inline" title="">the final say about rules</a> for enforcing the Republican tax overhaul passed in 2017. Mr. Mulvaney, then the head of the budget office, succeeded in wresting control over how to interpret tax regulations from the Treasury Department over Mr. Mnuchin’s objections.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Mr. Trump needed to replace his chief of staff in late 2018, some of Mr. Mnuchin’s aides privately expressed dismay that Mr. Mulvaney was tapped for the job.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Aides to both men have said that their differences were largely institutional rather than personal. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Mr. Mulvaney, said that despite the fact that his style differed from Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Mulvaney was ultimately looking for an outcome that would be good for the economy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Good cop, bad cop, he’s happy to play any role that gets the best deal for the hard-working American taxpayer,” Mr. Czwartacki said.</p>
