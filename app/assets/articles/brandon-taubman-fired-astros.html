<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Houston Astros fired Brandon Taubman, their assistant general manager, on Thursday and apologized to the women <!-- -->Taubman had made inappropriate comments toward<!-- -->, as well as to the reporter who made those comments public. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A Sports Illustrated<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2019/10/22/houston-astros-roberto-osuna-suspension" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> article</a> published Monday evening accused Taubman of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/sports/baseball/brandon-taubman-astros-roberto-osuna.html?module=inline" title="">yelling “Thank God we got Osuna,” </a> with an added expletive, at a group of female reporters in Houston’s clubhouse after the Astros clinched the American League Championship Series with a win over the Yankees on Saturday night. Taubman was referring to Roberto Osuna, a relief pitcher acquired by the Astros last season while he was serving a 75-game suspension over accusations of domestic violence. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Shortly after publication of the Sports Illustrated article by Stephanie Apstein, the Astros issued a statement that disputed the report — claiming that Taubman had been supporting a player during an interview — and referred to the article as “misleading and irresponsible” and a “fabrication.” On Tuesday, as criticism of the incident and the team’s reaction to it intensified, Taubman acknowledged that was not the case, but claimed his intentions had been misinterpreted.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Thursday, after assisting Major League Baseball in its investigation of the episode, the team reversed course.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We were wrong,” the Astros said in a statement announcing Taubman’s firing. “We sincerely apologize to Stephanie Apstein, Sports Illustrated and to all individuals who witnessed this incident or were offended by the inappropriate conduct. The Astros in no way intended to minimize the issues related to domestic violence.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The statement and firing came the day before Game 3 of the World Series in Washington and just a day after Taubman’s boss, General Manager Jeff Luhnow, had suggested in a radio interview that the true meaning of Taubman’s comments would never be known. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What we really don’t know is the intent behind the inappropriate comments he made,” Luhnow said. “We may never know that, because the person who said them and the people who heard them, at least up to this point, have different perspectives.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Taubman’s outburst was confirmed by <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/HannahRKeyser/status/1186455802002853888" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">multiple</a> <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/HunterAtkins35/status/1186474194772598784" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">witnesses</a>, including reporters for both The Houston Chronicle and Yahoo Sports. Sports Illustrated issued a statement saying it “unequivocally stands behind Apstein, her reporting and the story.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When asked for comment on Thursday, Apstein said she wanted her reporting to speak for itself.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At a news conference after Taubman’s firing, Luhnow discussed the decision and the team’s initial statement, which drew a great deal of criticism. He declined to say who had written the statement, though he acknowledged seeing it before it was released.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> “Regardless of who wrote it and who approved it, it was wrong, it was incorrect,” Luhnow said. “It should never have been sent out.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Taubman, 34, joined the Astros in 2013 after a career as a derivative valuation expert for Ernst &amp; Young. He initially served as an analyst in Houston’s baseball operations department but quickly rose through the ranks to become Luhnow’s top assistant, with duties including overseeing the team’s analytics and pro scouting departments. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Luhnow described his protégé as smart and hard-working and said the comments were out of character.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He hasn’t had this type of incident before,” Luhnow said. “This is not a repeating pattern of anything, which is why it was so easy for — one reason why it was so easy for — us to believe that it was more innocent than it turned out to be.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While Astros players have avoided discussing the issue this week, Manager A.J. Hinch strongly condemned the situation, saying on Tuesday before Game 1 of the World Series that he was “very disappointed” that the episode had happened.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It’s unfortunate, it’s uncalled-for,” he said, before adding: “No one — it doesn’t matter if it’s a player, a coach, a manager, any of you members of the media — should ever feel like when you come into our clubhouse that you’re going to be uncomfortable or disrespected.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At his news conference, Luhnow was asked if he had reached out personally to apologize to any of the women involved in the incident, including Apstein. He said his travel schedule, and his dealings with Taubman, had prevented him from doing that.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I had to have a pretty tough conversation this morning with someone that’s worked with me for a long time,” Luhnow said. “But I will as soon as I can.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a following news conference on Thursday, Hinch was asked if the incident had had any effect on his team. He said that he did not want to take anything away from what the Nationals had accomplished in racing to a two-games-to-none lead in the Series and that while the Astros players and staff members were sensitive to what had happened, game preparation had kept them from fully contemplating the situation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I don’t think we’ll know until we get well into the off-season and kind of process all this,” Hinch said. “But I continue to be disappointed and just sorry that it happened.” </p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">James Wagner contributed reporting. </p>
