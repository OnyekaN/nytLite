<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So you made it through the second set of <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/democratic-debates?module=inline" title="">Democratic debates</a>. Congratulations! Ready to talk about the next ones?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Democratic National Committee has set stricter criteria for the third set of debates, which will be held on Sept. 12 and Sept. 13 in Houston. If 10 or fewer candidates qualify, the debate will take place on only one night.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/us/full-democratic-debate-highlights.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The race is fluid, and other things we learned from the July Democratic debates.</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Candidates will need to have 130,000 unique donors <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">and </em>register at least 2 percent support in four polls. They have until Aug. 28 to reach those benchmarks.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">These criteria could easily halve the field: The first two sets of debates included 20 of the 24 candidates, but a New York Times analysis of polls and donor numbers shows that only 10 to 12 candidates are likely to make the third round.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Seven candidates have already met both qualification thresholds and are guaranteed a spot on stage. They are:</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Former Vice President <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Joseph R. Biden Jr.</strong></p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Senator <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Cory Booker</strong> of New Jersey</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Mayor <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Pete Buttigieg</strong> of South Bend, Ind.</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Senator <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Kamala Harris</strong> of California</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Former Representative <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Beto O’Rourke</strong> of Texas</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Senator <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Bernie Sanders</strong> of Vermont</p><p class="css-15hwz5e evys1bk0">Senator <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Elizabeth Warren</strong> of Massachusetts</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Three other candidates are very close: The former housing secretary <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Julián Castro</strong> and the entrepreneur <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Andrew Yang </strong>have surpassed 130,000 donations and each have three of the four qualifying polls they need, while Senator <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Amy Klobuchar</strong> of Minnesota has met the polling threshold and has about 120,000 donors.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beyond them, only three candidates have even a single qualifying poll to their name: the impeachment activist <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Tom Steyer</strong> (2 polls), Representative <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Tulsi Gabbard</strong> of Hawaii (1) and former Gov. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">John Hickenlooper</strong> of Colorado (1). </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We asked all three of their campaigns to provide donor numbers so we could assess where they stood. Ms. Gabbard had just under 114,000 donors as of Wednesday night. A spokesman for Mr. Steyer said he was “on track to collect the required number of donors to make the September debate stage” but did not give a number. Mr. Hickenlooper’s campaign did not respond, but <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/02/hickenlooper-2020-campaign-1395051" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Politico reported a month ago</a> that he had only 13,000 donors.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The other 11 candidates in the race have no qualifying polls to their name, and they all went into this week’s debates seeking a viral moment that would attract new donors and lift them, even briefly, in the polls. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The qualification rules do not require enduring support. Even a small post-debate surge could push a 1 percent candidate up to 2 percent in the small handful of polls he or she needs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But for those who have not qualified, the Aug. 28 deadline is an existential threat. Candidates like Senator <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Kirsten Gillibrand</strong> of New York or Gov. <strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">Jay Inslee</strong> of Washington could be washed out of the race if they don’t get momentum from this week’s debates. And if you’re wondering whether they’re anxious, the answer is yes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Gabbard’s campaign calculated at one point that she needed a new donor every minute to reach 130,000 by the Aug. 28 deadline, so if you go to her website, a timer next to the donation button begins counting down 60 seconds. Then the text changes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“🙁 Oh no!” it says. “The time expired and you didn’t donate!”</p>
