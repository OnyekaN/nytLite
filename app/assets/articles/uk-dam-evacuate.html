<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">LONDON — Residents of a small town in northern England have been ordered to evacuate after a dam on a 19th-century reservoir that looms above their homes was seriously damaged by heavy downpours. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Days after <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/world/europe/record-temperatures-heatwave.html?module=inline" title="">parts of Britain experienced record-shattering high temperatures</a> amid a heat wave across Europe, the dam was damaged as a result of another type of extreme weather: intense rainfall that battered much of northern England and left the reservoir overflowing. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It could be days before 1,500 residents who left their homes on Thursday in the town of Whaley Bridge — population 6,500 — are able to return. Officials warned that the dam, which holds 1.3 million tons of water, could crumble and that the likelihood of “severe flooding” could put many in “mortal danger.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Friday, a Royal Air Force Chinook helicopter that had joined efforts to stop the dam from collapsing dumped more than 200 bags of gravel onto the damaged site, as engineers using dozens of pumps diverted water from the reservoir into the surrounding area, police officials said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The government <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/target-area/013FWFD5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">issued an alert</a> on the potential for life-threatening flood in large stretches of the town. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Toddbrook reservoir, which was built in <!-- -->1831<!-- -->, sits high above the town. Managed by the Canal and River Trust, it is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, meaning that it provides habitat for herons, ducks and other animals and fish.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Whaley Bridge is in a valley, and some houses are above the reservoir water line. But flood experts fear that at least hundreds of properties could be at direct risk if the dam burst. The danger would be not only to the town below in the Derbyshire area, but also to many other villages along <!-- -->the Goyt River.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Martin Thomas, a local official, called the crisis “an unfortunate combination of circumstances.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We’ve had a lot of wet weather recently: The ground is saturated; the reservoir was already full,” he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-49189955" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">told the BBC.</a> “Something we previously looked at as a benign leisure facility suddenly becomes a real mortal danger.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Images and video online showed rushing, yellowish waters in the area after heavy rains brought flash floods that damaged roadways, shut rail lines and flooded homes and businesses. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Kem Mehmet, the assistant chief constable of the Derbyshire Police, urged the town’s residents to heed emergency warnings and advised those told to evacuate to stay away from their homes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We understand that being asked to leave your home is an extremely difficult and worrying situation to find yourself in,” Mr. Mehmet <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.derbyshire.police.uk/news/derbyshire/news/news/north/2019/july/further-update-on-the-whaley-bridge-incident/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">said in a statement</a>. “However it is not a decision we have taken lightly, and ultimately the safety of the public is our main concern.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pete Fotheringham, a resident of Whaley Bridge, said he had evacuated above the level of the dam and was staying with friends, but he described a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/petefothx/status/1157150833881972742" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">“lovely morning</a>” in the village since rains had abated. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Neighboring communities offered shelter and support for the displaced, while charities and aid groups mobilized to offer supplies for those in need. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was unclear how long the operation to stabilize the dam would take. Mr. Mehmet, the police official, said emergency services crews were “doing everything humanly possible to save the reservoir wall and to protect the town.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A spokesman for the trust said by email on Friday that the dam was inspected twice weekly. It <!-- -->was last inspected on Thursday, <!-- -->and “this identified the initial failure.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Crews are “working to draw down the water within the reservoir in a controlled way to reduce the risk to surrounding communities,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said the residents of Whaley Bridge “have our utmost sympathy.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We are doing all we can, with our colleagues at the Environment Agency, Derbyshire Police, Derbyshire County Council and the Fire &amp; Rescue Service, and further updates will follow,” he added.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Cleanup continued in other parts of the region, and crews were assessing the damage in Yorkshire, where a bridge over Grinton Moor was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-49164275" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">swept away by</a> floodwaters. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The bridge is typically part of the Yorkshire World Championships <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/racing/bridge-collapses-yorkshire-2019-world-championships-course-433349" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cycling course</a>, and officials said they would do their best to have it back up before the race in late September. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Boris Johnson, Britain’s new prime minister, said on Friday that emergency workers, engineers and the military were “working around the clock to fix the dam.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My thoughts are with those who have had to leave their homes and all of those who are affected in #WhaleyBridge,”<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1157227139030274048" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> he said on Twitter. </a></p>
