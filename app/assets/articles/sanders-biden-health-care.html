<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WASHINGTON — Senator Bernie Sanders does not understand Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s position on health care. To Mr. Sanders, the health care system is broken, and the only way to fix it is to replace it with his signature policy plan known as Medicare for All.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I am disappointed, I have to say, in Joe, who is a friend of mine, really distorting what Medicare for All is about,” Mr. Sanders said in an interview hours before he delivered a speech on Wednesday defending his health care proposal. “And unfortunately, he is sounding like Donald Trump. He is sounding like the health care industry in that regard.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To Mr. Biden, the current Democratic front-runner, Medicare for All is a costly and complex proposal that means eliminating private health insurance — and scrapping the Affordable Care Act.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I knew the Republicans would do everything in their power to repeal Obamacare,” he said in a video this week as he rolled out his own health care proposal. “They still are. But I’m surprised that so many Democrats are running on getting rid of it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After months of warily watching each other from afar, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden, two Democratic septuagenarian contenders for president, have taken aim at each other on the fraught and critical battleground of American health care policy.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Sanders in particular has escalated the attacks in recent days. His campaign called Mr. Biden’s health care plan “Bidencare” and even released a video that accuses him of “lying” about Medicare for All. But Mr. Biden, too, has been a more-than-willing participant, openly criticizing Medicare for All on multiple campaign swings over the last week.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/politics?smid=rd%3Faction%3Dclick&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">Sign up for our politics newsletter</a> <em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their sparring reflects strategic political calculations. For Mr. Biden, who appears <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/joe-biden-new-hampshire.html?module=inline" title="">increasingly willing </a>to draw contrasts with his Democratic rivals after a rocky first presidential debate, health care provides a way to highlight distinctions between himself and several opponents who support Medicare for All, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/us/politics/2020-democrats-medicare-for-all-public-option.html?module=inline" title="">including </a>Mr. Sanders and Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For Mr. Sanders, outraised by several rivals including Ms. Warren and falling in some polls, Medicare for All — which he has preached for decades — offers a possible path back to the center of the national political conversation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But there is more to their jousting than just normal campaign maneuvering. Health care is a personal issue for both men — to Mr. Sanders, it is a fundamental human right and embodies his lifelong message of economic equality. To Mr. Biden, who was vice president to Barack Obama when the Affordable Care Act was passed, it is also connected to the death of his son Beau Biden, who died after a battle with brain cancer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Politically, polls show that health care is a top priority for Democrats, and an emphasis on protecting people with pre-existing conditions and reducing health care costs helped Democrats in last year’s midterms when they picked up 40 seats in the House. With Mr. Trump and Republicans repeatedly threatening to unravel Obamacare, Democrats hope that the issue of health care will again work in their favor.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have both seemed at times to relish the debate, it has also thrown into sharp relief two competing visions for the Democratic Party.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden embraces fixes to the health care system and the addition of a public option, rather than a full-scale overhaul, portraying that approach as more pragmatic in today’s fractured political landscape, to say nothing of appealing to a nostalgia for the Obama era. The other view, championed by Mr. Sanders and others on the left, is that the nation’s challenges are so significant that only the boldest, most transformational proposals will do.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The philosophical clash erupted on Wednesday when Mr. Sanders delivered a formal address in Washington on the merits of replacing the current health care system with Medicare for All, saying his plan would “save lives” and urging presidential candidates to reject contributions from the health care industry.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though he did not mention Mr. Biden by name, he took several veiled swipes at him, joking about how much Americans love their private insurance (they do not, Mr. Sanders claimed, though <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/23/health/private-health-insurance-medicare-for-all-bernie-sanders.html?module=inline" title="">polls tell</a> a more complicated story) and about how they love paying their insurance premiums (ditto).</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It was a conflict that had been simmering for days.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last week, Mr. Biden told reporters in Portsmouth, N.H., that Medicare for All is not “Medicare as you know it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It is one that I think is going to be difficult to pass, No. 1,” he said. “But No. 2, I think people should be able to be in a situation, if they want to keep their employer-based insurance, they should be able to do it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Though Mr. Biden said that Mr. Sanders had been “very honest” about the costs of Medicare for All, he still drew a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/us/politics/joe-biden-new-hampshire.html?module=inline" title="">forceful rebuke</a> from the Vermont senator, who accused Mr. Biden of echoing the insurance and pharmaceutical industries — and Republicans — in his criticisms of Medicare for All.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And on Monday, Mr. Sanders blasted Mr. Biden’s health care plan, suggesting it was aligned with “corporate greed.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Aides to Mr. Sanders suggest the escalating confrontation plays into his hands: They have been trying to frame the primary as a competition between him and Mr. Biden, hoping to set up the same kind of insurgent-versus-establishment contrast that worked to Mr. Sanders’s advantage in 2016, when he was the foil to Hillary Clinton. And they view poaching supporters from Mr. Biden, particularly working-class Democrats, as the most promising way for Mr. Sanders to grow his base.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To help their case, they have been urging Mr. Sanders to go after Mr. Biden more aggressively.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Yet for weeks, they have remained frustrated with polls showing Mr. Biden still leading Mr. Sanders by comfortable margins, some allies said. The recent surges by Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris and the fund-raising prowess of Mayor Pete Buttigieg have also dispelled the notion that it is a two-person contest.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He’s clearly losing support, both in the national polls and in states,” Stan Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, said of Mr. Sanders. “He has no choice. I think he’s made a decision, he’s got to make himself relevant again. Health care was the issue in which he was relevant last time, and it was very important in the campaign in 2016, so I think it makes a lot of sense for him to try to draw this contrast on health care, particularly in the primary.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mark Longabaugh, who was one of Mr. Sanders’s top advisers in 2016 but left the 2020 team this year, said Mr. Sanders was “really good in a contrast.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he cautioned that the senator would be ill-advised to discount his other opponents at this point.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“You’ve got obviously several other significant candidates and actors in this thing,” he said. “I just don’t see this election turning into a Biden-versus-Bernie race.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden’s allies point to the current political realities in Washington — which includes a Republican-controlled Senate — as evidence that passing a sweeping overhaul of the nation’s health care system would be exceedingly difficult, and argue that Mr. Biden’s proposal is more realistic.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’m not so sure anyone believes Americans are ready to go through a wholesale change in the health care system,” said John Anzalone, a Biden pollster. “Joe Biden is approaching this as, people are hurting, what can we do now, or in the very near future, when a Democrat is president?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a separate interview over the weekend with The New York Times, Mr. Sanders appeared to acknowledge the steep political requirements of his proposal, saying “a Democratic Senate is certainly absolutely imperative if we’re going to go forward,” and added that members on both sides of the aisle would have to come together to create “a system which is designed not to provide huge profits for the drug companies and the insurance companies but quality care to all people.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As the battle over health care continues, even Mr. Sanders’s advisers are no longer hiding their distaste for Mr. Biden’s criticisms.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This campaign will not be a punching bag for misinformation out of the Biden campaign,” said Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sanders’s 2016 campaign manager and his closest adviser.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Referring to the last presidential contest, he added, “If people want to go into the general election in 2020 with a candidate with the same set of policy prescriptions as 2016, that’s a real roll of the dice.”</p>
