The New York police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, will decide whether Mr. Pantaleo should be removed from the force, which should have been done long ago. He was suspended without pay after the judge’s decision.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">More than two weeks ago, just one day before the statute of limitations would have run out, the Justice Department said it <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/nyregion/eric-garner-case-death-daniel-pantaleo.html?module=inline" title="">wouldn’t bring federal civil rights charges</a> against Mr. Pantaleo for putting Garner in a chokehold that caused<!-- --> an asthma and fatal heart attack<!-- --> in 2014 as Mr. Garner cried, “I can’t breathe.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A state grand jury declined to indict Mr. Pantaleo, five years ago, and as departmental disciplinary action has been delayed, he not only remains on modified duty but also received <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/09/officer-in-eric-garner-death-boosts-overtime-pay-105359" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">an increase in overtime pay</a>. So far, nobody has been held accountable for Mr. Garner’s death.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After meeting with federal prosecutors, the Garner family stood outside a courthouse in Brooklyn, convulsing with pain.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Y’all watched him kill my father,” Mr. Garner’s daughter Emerald Garner shouted as she stood before the cameras, her voice heavy with anger. “Fire him.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mayor Bill de Blasio and the Police Department delayed disciplinary action against Officer Pantaleo because the Justice Department asked them to wait while it considered whether to prosecute him. On Wednesday, the mayor pledged that the Garner family would get justice in 30 days. He has also said waiting so long for the Justice Department to bring charges was a mistake.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Police Department finally began a disciplinary hearing in May, after the Civilian Complaint Review Board brought charges. The administrative judge, Rosemarie Maldonado, found that Officer Pantaleo was reckless, used excessive force, was aware of the risk of a chokehold and knew he was not supposed to have used it, person familiar with the decision told The Times.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Standing in the hot sun outside City Hall on July 16, Mr. Garner’s mother, Gwen Carr, implored Mr. de Blasio to fire Officer Pantaleo. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Do your job,” she said. “Come forward and show yourself as the mayor you were elected to be.” As she spoke, Mr. de Blasio, who won election largely because of support from black New Yorkers while promising to hold the police accountable, was at Gracie Mansion, miles away.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">City law seems to preclude the city from firing Officer Pantaleo until the conclusion of the hearing.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Given the facts of the case, it’s hard to see his continued employment by the Police Department as anything but an insult to the people of New York.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Garner, who was unarmed and supposedly selling loose cigarettes, which is illegal, died because Officer Pantaleo used a chokehold. The Police Department <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/nyregion/kelly-bans-choke-holds-by-officers.html?module=inline" title="">banned the use of chokeholds in 1993</a> amid a rise in deaths linked to the maneuver.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/opinion/eric-garner-trial.html?module=inline" title="">searing testimony</a> at the departmental trial this year, the medical examiner said the chokehold <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/nyregion/eric-garner-death-daniel-pantaleo-chokehold.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">triggered an asthma attack</a> that led to Mr. Garner’s death, which he ruled a homicide.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A police internal affairs investigator also testified that he <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/nyregion/eric-garner-death-daniel-pantaleo-trial-chokehold.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">recommended disciplinary charges</a> against Officer Pantaleo in 2015. None came until last year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beyond any violation of departmental rules, Officer Pantaleo’s actions violated good sense and demonstrated the kind of overly aggressive policing that has led to many controversial deaths. He chose to escalate an encounter, involving several officers, with an unarmed man over a minor violation, then used a dangerous and banned maneuver. Video of the episode, viewed by millions, shows the officer with his arm across Mr. Garner’s throat.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Even before Mr. Garner’s death, the Civilian Complaint Review Board had substantiated <!-- -->four allegations of abuse<!-- --> against him in previous cases.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Why should an officer like Officer Pantaleo remain on the force, diminishing the trust of New Yorkers? </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Justice Department’s delay is inexcusable. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The city’s deference to federal prosecutors, and lack of urgency, are offensive. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That Officer Pantaleo could remain on the force, after everything, is unimaginable. </p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
