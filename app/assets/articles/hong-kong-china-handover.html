Would the Chinese government hold to its promise to maintain “one country, two systems” for the next 50 years? Would it let Hong Kong remain Hong Kong?</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beijing was quick to offer reassurances.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> “China,” its premier told his British counterpart, “would prove her words by her deeds,” according a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.slideshare.net/HKDF/841219-0945-mt-zhao-memcon-43108196" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">declassified British government memo</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But as Hong Kong marks the 22nd anniversary of the handover on Monday, some of China’s recent deeds suggest something else.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hong Kongers may still enjoy a degree of freedom mainland Chinese can only envy, with freedom of assembly, a free press and an unfettered judicial system. But almost every day brings new evidence those freedoms are slipping away, with the territory falling farther under Beijing’s shadow. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent weeks, Hong Kongers have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/30/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-live-updates.html?module=inline" title="">taken to the streets to protest</a>. For many here, there is a sense of time running out.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There will be a moment that mainland China will completely take over Hong Kong,” said Danny Chan, a 25-year-old primary school teaching assistant who joined a recent protest. “As a Hong Kong citizen, the best we can do is postpone it.”</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">HOW WE GOT HERE</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The British arrived in China in the late 17th century, bent on trade and empire, and soon found themselves at odds with Chinese rulers happy to export their goods, but far less interested in importing the West’s. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In opium, Britain saw a way in, forcing the drug onto the Chinese market against the wishes of the Manchu emperors.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The British claimed Hong Kong from the Chinese through two wars, later securing part of the territory with a 99-year lease that expired on July 1, 1997.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During the Hong Kong handover talks in the 1980s, China rejected Britain’s desire to continue running the territory, and instead proposed that Hong Kong become a semi-autonomous region of China. China’s then-premier, Zhao Ziyang, told Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain that there should be no doubts about Beijing’s trustworthiness.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And at first, when <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/0630.html?module=inline#article" title="">Beijing took over in 1997</a>, it did take a light touch. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the fears of many in Hong Kong that their rights would disappear overnight in 1997 proved exaggerated, since then there has been a gradually escalating assault on liberty.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Unlike in 1997, I think some of the unease today comes from certainty, not uncertainty,” said Peter T.Y. Cheung, an associate professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s controlling approach toward the territory has grown increasingly clear since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012 and set out to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/world/asia/china-xi-jinping.html?module=inline" title="">strengthen his grip</a> across the country.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“In particular over the past six, seven or eight years, we have seen Beijing tightening its grip over Hong Kong,” said Anson Chan, the No. 2 official in Hong Kong government before the handover and for four years after.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">During Britain’s rule of Hong Kong, the colonial governor was appointed, and directly elected seats on the legislature were only introduced in the early 1990s.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.basiclaw.gov.hk/en/basiclawtext/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Basic Law</a>, which amounts to a constitution for Hong Kong and took effect in 1997, <!-- -->declares that the <!-- -->“ultimate aim” is for the chief executive and the entire legislature to be chosen by <!-- -->voters<!-- -->. In 2007, when China was led by <!-- -->Hu Jintao<!-- -->, it set a date for the vote, saying the chief executive could be directly elected in 2017, followed by the whole legislature.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That did not happen.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2017, Hong Kong’s chief executive was once again chosen by a committee that has always done Beijing’s bidding. And nearly half the legislature is made up of representatives chosen by professional sectors, <!-- -->not the voters at large<!-- -->. There is no sign that will change when the legislature is up for election again next year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The most significant area of erosion is the promise that 20 years after 1997, Hong Kong should be able to choose its own chief executive through a direct election,” said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. “That promise has clearly not been kept.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Carrie Lam, who became chief executive in 2017, often says that she has two bosses, Beijing and Hong Kong. But Beijing’s role in choosing the chief executive leads to widespread questions over who calls the shots in Hong Kong.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beijing did once endorse a form of direct elections for Hong Kong, but with a big catch: Hong Kongers could vote for their leader, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/01/world/asia/hong-kong-elections.html?module=inline" title="">the Chinese legislature decided</a> in 2014, but the candidates must first be approved by a pro-Beijing nominating committee. In other words, Hong Kong could elect its own leader, but only from a handful of candidates acceptable to the Communist Party.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thus was the so-called Umbrella Movement born. Those restrictions set off <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/29/world/asia/clashes-in-hong-kong.html?module=inline" title="">huge protests in Hong Kong</a>, and demonstrators occupied city streets for nearly three months to protest what they labeled “fake democracy.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A year later, the Hong Kong legislature <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/world/asia/hong-kong-votes-down-beijing-election-plan.html?module=inline" title="">rejected the plan</a>, with pro-democracy lawmakers voting unanimously against it. Some suggested that the democratic camp may have missed a chance at an incremental gain that could have later been improved upon.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">When Britain and China hashed out <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/20/world/hong-kong-accord-is-signed-in-peking.html?module=inline" title="">a treaty</a> in the 1980s on what a post-handover world would look like, negotiators were at pains to establish where China’s authority ended and Hong Kong's began.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Foreign affairs? China. National Defense? The same. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, all other responsibilities were to reside with Hong Kong.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In recent years, though, there have been clear signs those lines are blurring, especially when it comes to the realm of justice.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">So when Hong Kongers, who were already afraid their autonomy was deteriorating, got word about a new extradition measure coming before the Hong Kong legislature that would ease sending people to mainland China for trial, the result was <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/20/world/asia/hong-kong-protest-size.html?module=inline" title="">huge street protests</a> unlike any since the Umbrella Movement — and a delay of the plan by the authorities.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While the extradition measure would make it legally easier for mainland China to seize Hong Kongers, the absence of such a law appears not to have stopped mainland authorities in the past. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2015, five people connected with Causeway Bay Books, a Hong Kong establishment that sold gossipy books about mainland Chinese politics, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/business/international/in-china-books-that-make-money-and-enemies.html?module=inline" title="">disappeared</a>. One was apparently grabbed off the streets of Hong Kong, another kidnapped from his home in Thailand. Three more were detained in mainland China, <!-- -->where all five were held<!-- --> and one remains in custody.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As lawless as these covert actions may seem, they may be, paradoxically, less of a threat to Hong Kong’s autonomy than overt coercion, since they involve going around the backs of the local courts rather than insisting that judges bend their standards.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Many in Hong Kong fear that the proposed extradition law would allow mainland authorities to directly demand the handover of people wanted in political cases, despite promised human rights safeguards.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After the law was proposed, Lam Wing-kee, one of the previously detained booksellers, fled to Taiwan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“From the book store incident, you can see that the Chinese government wants to control free speech in Hong Kong,” he said. “Now it’s gotten worse. With the extradition law they want to make such kidnappings legal, and bring Chinese law to Hong Kong.”</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Joint Declaration signed in 1984 declares that a free press will be ensured by law. But many media organizations say they are struggling as mainland China undermines that right.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There are many ways such pressure is applied.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Executives at the most vocally pro-democracy newspaper, Apple Daily, say the Chinese government’s liaison office has told large companies to pull advertising.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">And last year, Hong Kong <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/world/asia/hong-kong-journalist-financial-times.html?module=inline" title="">expelled a Financial Times editor</a> who had hosted a talk by an activist who called for the city’s secession from China. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The decision to expel a representative of a powerful Western publication sent a chill through many in the city. Some journalists began saying that the long-predicted “death of Hong Kong” had finally arrived.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The independent book publishing industry has also taken a big hit. The Causeway Bay Books detentions shocked many in the industry, leading some businesses to close. The few that remain say they have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/books/hong-kong-publishing-tiananmen.html?module=inline" title="">run into severe difficulties</a> printing and selling books on politics and history in Hong Kong, which they attribute to pressure from the mainland.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Sino United Publishing, a Chinese government-owned company, now controls almost all of the book publishing and retail sales market in Hong Kong. Books banned on the mainland are not found on the shelves of its outlets.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">WHAT WE FOUND</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Hong Kong’s judiciary is one of the most deeply respected of local institutions, prized for its independence. Its judges, often educated in England, are in the habit of issuing decisions that protect civil liberties.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Beijing promised to protect all that. Instead, it is whittling away at it.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">China’s central government made its views on Hong Kong courts clear in a 2014 white paper that called judges “administrators” who must be patriots and for whom “loving the country” is a basic political requirement. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Hong Kong people are used to separation of powers,” said Martin Lee, a founder of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party who served on the Basic Law drafting committee. “This was alarming.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While most observers say Hong Kong’s courts remain independent, the fundamental weakness is that Beijing acts as a Supreme Court, deciding how the territory’s laws should be interpreted. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2016, Beijing used that power against pro-democracy lawmakers who staged protests during their oaths of office. After the Chinese legislature ruled that oaths must be taken “sincerely and solemnly,” what happened to the lawmakers? They <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/world/asia/hong-kong-lawmakers-democracy.html?module=inline" title="">were ousted</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10">The Takeaway:</strong> On paper, Hong Kong’s autonomy is guaranteed for another 28 years. On the ground, the reality appears far less certain.</p>
