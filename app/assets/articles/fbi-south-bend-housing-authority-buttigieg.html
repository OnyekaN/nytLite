<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">F.B.I. agents raided the offices of the Housing Authority of South Bend, Ind., on Wednesday, the second potential distraction back home for the presidential campaign of the city’s mayor, Pete Buttigieg.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">No one was arrested during the raid, in which evidence collection teams visited the housing authority’s headquarters on Alonzo Watson Drive about 1 p.m. with a police officer and United States government trucks.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The agency, which runs nine low-income housing facilities in South Bend and is financed by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, has been beleaguered by complaints of financial mismanagement for much of the decade. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Such concerns prompted Mr. Buttigieg to <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/politics/south-bend-mayor-shakes-up-troubled-housing-authority/article_d4b05f95-cbdb-51b7-81dd-34515daa0520.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">replace all six commissioners on the housing authority’s board</a> in 2015. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Buttigieg, 37, distanced himself from the agency in a statement issued by the mayor’s office, which emphasized that the housing authority is an autonomous entity.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Earlier today the mayor’s office became aware through local media reports of today’s law enforcement action at the Housing Authority," Mr. Buttigieg’s statement said. “While the Housing Authority is not part of the city administration, the mayor is concerned and will be closely following the situation.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In June, Mr. Buttigieg <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/politics/buttigieg-south-bend-shooting.html?module=inline" title="">briefly left the campaign trail after a fatal shooting of a black man in South Bend by a white police officer</a>, which sparked protests in the city of just over 100,000 people. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Law enforcement officials declined to comment about the nature of the raid on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Department of Justice regulations prohibit us from either confirming or denying the existence of an investigation,” Ryan Holmes, a spokesman for the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Indiana, said in an email. “However I can confirm there is federal law enforcement activity going on in the South Bend area.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tonya Robinson, the housing authority’s executive director, did not immediately respond to an email request for comment on Wednesday. The voice mail at Ms. Robinson’s home phone number was full. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tim Scott, a member of the South Bend Common Council, said he was concerned that housing authority tenants would be displaced by the raid at the agency’s headquarters, which is connected to one of its housing complexes. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“We don’t really have a say on anything that goes on in the housing authority,” Mr. Scott said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Scott, who is supporting Mr. Buttigieg’s presidential bid, said he didn’t know if the F.B.I. raid would have reverberations for Mr. Buttigieg’s campaign until further details emerged. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In 2013, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.southbendtribune.com/news/publicsafety/south-bend-housing-authority-offices-closed-as-fbi-agents-appear/article_c40a590b-04cd-5288-bc62-002299ee8f87.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">HUD designated the city’s housing authority as “troubled”</a> after an audit revealed discrepancies in housing applicant records, according to The South Bend Tribune. The housing authority then owed HUD $500,000 in funds earmarked for low-income families that were misused, according to published reports at the time. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The turmoil on the home front followed a spring surge by Mr. Buttigieg, a Harvard-educated Rhodes Scholar who served as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve and was deployed to Afghanistan. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">From April through June, Mr. Buttigieg raised nearly $25 million. But he has been unable to reach his Democratic presidential polling high-water mark of 10 percent from the end of April. A July 29 Quinnipiac University poll put Mr. Buttigieg at 6 percent, compared to 34 percent for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. </p>
