<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On the kitchen counter in her Leimert Park apartment in Los Angeles, Diane Henry lays out her meals for the week. They’re frozen, in equal-sized containers: Florentine tart, noodles with carrots, oven-fried chicken with brown rice and carrots, and Moroccan chicken. She didn’t choose the menu, but she does get a few options. Generally she’s happy with the selections.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">With strict nutrition guidelines allowing only two milligrams of sodium per day, some meals require seasoning. If Ms. Henry wants more flavor, she will use salsa, lemon or turmeric. Though she says the meals are tasty, she is tempted to cheat. “I really want mac and cheese and soul food and pastrami,” she says.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Ms. Henry, 54, wants even more to live without fluid surrounding her lungs, a key part of her condition, congestive heart failure. The program she signed up for is designed to help her and approximately 1,000 other clients avoid ending up in hospital, as she did last November.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last year, California’s version of Medicare, Medi-Cal, introduced a three-year pilot study that’s already showing what experts in the health care field have seen anecdotally — that tailored nutrition can improve health and lower medical costs for chronically ill patients. The pilot includes specially formulated meals and in-home visits for patients like Ms. Henry who suffer from her type of heart disease, which has caused some of the <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4783289/#R1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">highest rates of hospital readmissions</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.angelfood.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Project Angel Food</a>, one of six California nonprofits participating in the pilot, delivers Ms. Henry’s meals. In addition to providing lunch and dinner, and a nutritional guide for every meal, nutritionists show clients how to portion her meals — and when they’re ready to transition off the program, how to shop for food and cook for themselves.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Nayeli Perales, a registered dietitian with Project Angel Food, has four sessions with each client over 12 weeks. After determining her client’s dietary habits, Ms. Pareles will explain the new restrictions and follow up to track progress. After clients have transitioned out of the program, Ms. Pareles will make a follow-up visit to help clients make their own meals and shop for healthy food that meets their dietary restrictions. “After the program, they still will be making their own meals and will be eating out,” Ms. Pareles said. “It is an overall lifestyle change.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Most of the restrictions eliminate saturated fats and emphasize whole grains, in addition to limiting sodium and fluids. (In congestive heart failure, the body can no longer maintain an appropriate balance between sodium and water.) For lower-income patients who may often rely on canned or prepared foods, this can feel overwhelming, especially if they don’t have the means to start shopping for healthy fresh food and cooking it from scratch.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Medi-Cal patients were chosen for the pilot because in general they frequently use the health care system. Data from 2017 shows that of California Medicaid’s patients with congestive heart failure who are discharged from hospital, a third return in less than a month. Published estimates of average hospital stays for those with the condition range between five to six days, with cost estimates between $10,000 and $15,000 per stay. But self-reported statistics showed a mere 6.2 percent readmission rate after 30 days for the 404 participants enrolled in the Medi-Cal pilot, as of Sept. 30.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Because of high utilization rates associated with congestive heart failure, it was one of the conditions of most interest to the federal Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services in their Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, under the Affordable Care Act. <!-- -->That program incrementally reduced hospital payments for frequent readmissions. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">As many of the issues that prompt heavy use of health care assistance are social and structural, like low health literacy, social isolation, and lack of access to healthy food options, the Medicare and Medicaid program often hit hospitals in poorer neighborhoods and rural hospitals the hardest. The decreased reimbursement leads to a downward spiral for hospitals and patients. Some provocative research on that subject, published <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2663213?redirect=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">last year</a>, suggested that the federal centers’ program might actually have increased mortality from heart failure.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Another body of research, however, is showing that medically tailored meals can go a long way toward reversing that downward health spiral. A retrospective cohort study headed by Seth Berkowitz, M.D. at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill School of Medicine, and <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2730768" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">published in April</a> concluded: “Participation in a medically tailored meals program appears to be associated with fewer hospital and skilled nursing admissions and less overall medical spending.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Tanvir Hussein, a clinical cardiologist and board member of Project Angel Food, said he is impressed by the preliminary results of the Medi-Cal study. If the numbers hold up and Medi-Cal chooses to add medically tailored meals in its coverage, he said, it could be a game changer for the lower-income populations he serves in southern Los Angeles.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Maximal compliance with drug therapy doesn’t keep congestive heart failure patients out of the hospital without dietary adherence,” Dr. Hussain said. So providing medically tailored meals “is a potentially easy win all around,” he said. “Sick or elderly patients can stay home and remain independent, while reduced hospital admissions dramatically reduces health care costs and overall burden on the system.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In Pennsylvania, Medicare payers are using medically tailored meals as part of treatment, based on a small 2013 <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/580a7cb9e3df2806e84bb687/t/58c6c935a5790aa56aa29936/1489422913448/Journal+of+Primary+Care+%26+Community+Health-2013-Gurvey-2150131913490737.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">study</a> led by a Philadelphia nonprofit, Manna, that showed patients who received three medically tailored meals per day had shorter stays at hospital and far lower rates of hospitalization overall, compared to a control group. Now four companies that administer Medicaid in southeastern Pennsylvania have contracted with Manna to deliver specially tailored meals for selected patients with diabetes, cancer, renal disease, cancer and high-risk pregnancy, as well as congestive heart failure.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">AmeriHealth Caritas’s southeastern Pennsylvania health plan began a medically tailored meals pilot in August 2016; starting with 472 members who went through the program, it had delivered 175,601 meals to a total of 553 members as of Sept. 30.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Care management has been at the center of that program. “Patients on the program must be simultaneously engaged in care management, so food is a small part of all pieces that fit together for members’ health,” said Joanne McFall, market president for AmeriHealth Caritas’s southeastern Pennsylvania health plan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A study of 179 of the initial participants, from August 2016 to January 2018, showed a reduction of nearly 25 percent in overall medical costs, a 31 percent decrease in inpatient visits and a 20 percent decrease in emergency room visits.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Manna also serves patients with Aetna Better Health of Pennsylvania, a Medicare contractor. Their meals program began in October 2016 with 30 members, and has slowly grown over time. They too have seen a 30 percent reduction in patient hospitalization, according to Dr. Bernard Lewin, the organization’s chief medical officer.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Dr. Lewin said that medically tailored meals represent a “shift in thinking from a problem-based medical delivery system to a holistic, wellness-focused preventive maintenance.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Providing free meals to sick people at home could be politically contentious in many states unless officials in charge of payments see significant cost savings. But supporters say the savings from reducing frequent hospital admissions could be just as substantial, or even better, than any drug or device for heart failure.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While medical cost reductions are a significant benefit, Dr. Lewin said, he’s most concerned with the quality of people’s lives. “Someone who has congestive heart failure has a limited ability to do any work, and I mean walking up a flight of stairs. By addressing dietary elements to address that condition, they’re now able to get out of the house, but that improvement doesn’t show up on any spreadsheet.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Henry said that since she joined the Medi-Cal pilot in December, she’s lost some weight and has more energy, though she admits some days are better than others.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“What I want to do is be able to take a long walk, go dancing,” she said. “And wear my heels! I’m 54 and I still have a lot of life left.”</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">Larry Buhl is a multimedia journalist based in Los Angeles.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">To receive email alerts for Fixes columns, sign up </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://eepurl.com/ABIxL" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">here.</em></a></p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">The Times is committed to publishing </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">a diversity of letters</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> to the editor.
