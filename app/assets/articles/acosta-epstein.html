<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">WASHINGTON — Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta on Wednesday defended his handling of the sex crimes prosecution of the financier Jeffrey Epstein in Florida more than a decade ago, bucking a growing chorus of Democratic resignation calls while effectively making the case to President Trump to keep his job.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">At a televised news conference watched intently in the White House, Mr. Acosta offered a clinical explanation of the 2008 plea deal, arguing that he overrode state authorities to ensure that Mr. Epstein would face jail time and that holding out for a stiffer sentence by going to trial would have been “a roll of the dice.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I wanted to help them,” Mr. Acosta, who was the top federal prosecutor in Miami at the time, said of the victims during an hourlong session with reporters at the Labor Department. “That is why we intervened. And that’s what the prosecutors of my office did — they insisted that he go to jail and put the world on notice that he was and is a sexual predator.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">His comments did little to quell the furor over the deal, which has come under renewed scrutiny since <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-charges.html?module=inline" title="">Mr. Epstein was charged on Monday</a> in New York with running a sex-trafficking operation that lured dozens of girls, some as young as 14, to his Upper East Side home and to a mansion in Palm Beach, Fla. Lawyers for some of the victims and the former Palm Beach prosecutor accused Mr. Acosta of rewriting history.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">While condemning Mr. Epstein’s “horrific” crimes, Mr. Acosta offered no apologies, nor did he channel the visceral outrage over the deal felt by many critics. Instead, he offered a measured, nuanced defense unusual for an administration in which attack-the-attacker bombast is more common while suggesting that times had changed in a way that made his compromise a decade ago look different.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Today we know a lot more about how victims’ trauma impacts their testimony,” he said. “Our juries are more accepting of contradictory statements, understand that trauma-impacted memories work differently. And today our judges do not allow victim shaming by defense attorneys.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For Mr. Acosta, the real question was how his defense would go over with the president, who urged him to publicly explain his decisions as a prosecutor. Mr. Trump was assured by aides that Mr. Acosta did well during his news conference, and the president did not immediately signal disagreement, advisers said. But the case is acutely uncomfortable for Mr. Trump, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/trump-epstein.html?module=inline" title="">who at one point in the past socialized with Mr. Epstein</a>, a fellow denizen of wealthy circles in Palm Beach and Manhattan.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The White House made no official statement, and Mr. Trump’s Twitter account remained silent on the matter in the hours after the news conference.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Acosta expressed confidence that he still had Mr. Trump’s backing and rejected reports that Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, had suggested he be forced out. “My relationship with the president is outstanding,” he said. “He has very publicly made clear that I’ve got his support.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The political drama played out as another woman came forward to accuse Mr. Epstein of sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. The woman, Jennifer Araoz, who had not previously been identified as a victim, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-he-raped-me-when-i-was-n1028011" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">told NBC News</a> that she was approached outside her Upper East Side high school in 2001, when she was 14, by a woman who took her to Mr. Epstein’s Manhattan home.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Over the next year, she said, she was enticed to give Mr. Epstein massages in her underwear while he masturbated. Eventually, she said, he raped her when she was 15.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“He raped me — forcefully raped me,” Ms. Araoz said. “He knew exactly what he was doing.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Her lawyer, Kimberly Lerner, said Ms. Araoz had not talked to federal prosecutors and was not one of the women included in the indictment.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The charges filed against Mr. Epstein on Monday, along with the discovery of hundreds of nude images of young women or girls at his New York residence, have created an angry public debate over Mr. Acosta’s role in the original plea deal.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Acosta was serving as the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida when he brokered the agreement that resulted in Mr. Epstein’s pleading guilty in state court and serving 13 months in jail without facing federal charges after being accused of sexually abusing dozens of young women and girls.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Acosta said he intervened in the case because state authorities were pursuing a single charge that would not have resulted in Mr. Epstein’s being jailed or having to register as a sex offender. “Simply put, the Palm Beach state attorney’s office was willing to let Epstein walk free, no jail time, nothing,” Mr. Acosta said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he said he chose not to go to trial because victims were “scared and traumatized,” and in some cases were refusing to testify and in others were even exonerating Mr. Epstein. “How do you weigh those two if going to trial is viewed as a roll of the dice?” he said. “The goal here was straightforward: Put Epstein behind bars; ensure that he registers as a sexual offender.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Barry E. Krischer, who at the time served as Palm Beach state attorney, responded to Mr. Acosta’s news conference on Wednesday with a scathing rebuke, accusing the labor secretary of trying to “rewrite history” by blaming state authorities.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I can emphatically state that Mr. Acosta’s recollection of this matter is completely wrong,” Mr. Krischer said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He said a grand jury heard all of the evidence available at the time and returned a single count of felony solicitation of prostitution, but Mr. Acosta’s office later abandoned its own 53-page indictment after secret negotiations with Mr. Epstein’s lawyers.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“No matter how my office resolved the state charges, the U.S. attorney’s office always had the ability to file its own federal charges,” Mr. Krischer said. “If Mr. Acosta was truly concerned with the state’s case and felt he had to rescue the matter, he would have moved forward with the 53-page indictment that his own office drafted.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A federal judge ruled in February that the agreement brokered by Mr. Acosta violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act by not notifying Mr. Epstein’s victims until later.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Acosta said on Wednesday that his office delayed telling victims because it was not sure that Mr. Epstein would go through with the agreement, which included a provision allowing victims to seek financial restitution. If Mr. Epstein had gone to trial rather than pleading guilty, Mr. Acosta said, defense lawyers could have undercut the credibility of the victims by suggesting they were in it only for the money.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Acosta agreed with critics who complained that Mr. Epstein was allowed to leave custody up to 12 hours a day, six days a week to work, but said that was a state decision. “This work-release was complete BS,” he said, “and I have been on record as far back as 2011 saying that it was not what was bargained for and it was not what we expected.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Asked if he had any regrets, Mr. Acosta said, “Look, no regrets is a very hard question. You always look back and you say, ‘What if?’” He added: “We did what we did because we wanted to see Epstein go to jail. He needed to go to jail. He needed to go to jail. And that was the focus.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lawyers for some of the victims sharply disputed Mr. Acosta’s account on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Unbelievable,” said Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer who represented three of the women. “Ignoring the facts of what actually occurred 12 years ago. Doing his best to put a good light on a bad deal.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Adam Horowitz, a lawyer who represented seven of the victims, said that Mr. Acosta’s arguments were disingenuous. He acknowledged that the young women were scared to testify, but said that that was because prosecutors had terrified them.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The prosecutors were saying, ‘These defense lawyers are going to go through your whole personal life, dig up your bad acts and your sex life,’” Mr. Horowitz said. “When they heard that from prosecutors, sure they were intimidated. They kept saying, ‘Are you sure you want to do this?’”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Horowitz added: “The big picture is he was really shifting blame to the state prosecutors and to the career professional and distancing himself from it, but at the same time saying it was the best deal under the circumstances.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Acosta has privately reached out to political allies for help handling the public relations debacle and inquired about potential postgovernment work should he be forced out, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in the end, Mr. Trump — who has before dealt with harsh criticism engulfing several of his cabinet aides — signaled that it was up to Mr. Acosta to defend himself, according to several White House officials familiar with that discussion.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a sign that congressional Democrats are seeking to increase pressure on Mr. Acosta, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, sent a letter to the labor secretary on Wednesday afternoon, requesting that he testify this month about the case before the committee.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Your testimony is even more critical now that federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York unsealed a new indictment earlier this week outlining a host of additional charges against Mr. Epstein,” Mr. Cummings said in the letter, “including luring dozens of teenage girls to his homes in New York City and Palm Beach, Florida, and paying them to engage in sexual activity with him.”</p>
