<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">DETROIT — Wednesday’s debate was barely underway when the attacks began on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris, and some of their Democratic rivals rarely let up. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Harris was criticized on her new health care plan and her record as attorney general of California. Mr. Biden took incoming fire from all sides on his record on crime, immigration, and abortion rights — and whether a candidate with over 40 years in the public eye could energize liberals in the Democratic Party.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Here are five highlights from the debate:</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Perhaps no one captured the risks facing Mr. Biden better than he did himself. As he greeted Ms. Harris, the rival who had cut him down in the June debate, he shook her hand and offered gamely, “Go easy on me, kid.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She did not. And neither did the others, as almost all his rivals took turns swinging at him: Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington on Mr. Biden’s climate change ambitions; Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/us/politics/joe-biden-immigration.html?module=inline" title="">on deportations</a>; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/cory-booker-debate-biden.html?rref=collection%2Fnewseventcollection%2F2020-election&amp;module=inline" title="">on criminal justice</a>; and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/joe-biden-op-ed.html?module=inline" title="">on gender issues</a>.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Unlike last time, Mr. Biden was not caught unawares. He stood his ground, and often unfurled prepared countermeasures to neutralize attacks that rivals had telegraphed, <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-2020.html?module=inline" title="">perhaps overly so</a>, in advance.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Biden was not particularly fluent. He was not particularly forceful. He continued to cut himself off, interjecting “anyway’s” that meandered into dead-ends. In his closing statement, he seemed to confuse a text message for a URL. <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/joe-30330.html?module=inline" title="">“Go to Joe 30330,”</a> he told voters.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But he highlighted both his close association with a popular Barack Obama and his brand of moderation that has led many voters to view him as the party’s best coalition-builder in a general election against President Trump. He resisted calls to decriminalize the border or embrace a system of solely government-provided health care.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“My response is: Obamacare is working,” he said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But in a sign that Mr. Biden did not deliver a signature moment, his campaign emailed supporters the offer of a sticker just as the debate wrapped up. It reads: “Obamacare. It’s a BFD.” Fittingly, it was a line Mr. Biden delivered years ago, not on Wednesday night.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[</em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/debate-joe-biden.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">To those who had written Joe Biden off after the first debate, he had this to say: “malarkey.”</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This time, Ms. Harris wasn’t just the hunter, she was also the hunted.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After surprising Mr. Biden with an attack on his record on civil rights <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-joe-biden-busing.html?module=inline" title="">during the June debate</a>, Ms. Harris didn’t get off any clean shots at the former vice president on Wednesday night. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She spent just as much time playing defense against Mr. Biden over <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/us/politics/kamala-harris-prisoners-tulsi-gabbard.html?module=inline" title="">her record as California’s attorney general</a>, and against Mayor Bill de Blasio and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado for <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-medicare-for-all.html?module=inline" title="">her middle-ground position on health care</a>, as she did throwing rhetorical punches.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Harris at times appeared unsteady in responding to the barbs, though none of her opponents executed a damaging blow.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Still, the focus on Ms. Harris from both the liberal and moderate ends of the party’s spectrum reveals her true standing in this primary race: She is the candidate others fear has the best chance of catapulting herself to the top of the field.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There was no big moment for Ms. Harris on Wednesday night. But unlike at the first debate, she didn’t take the stage needing or planning a breakthrough moment. Just keeping pace with Mr. Biden at the top of the field was good enough. For now.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Booker entered the 2020 race preaching the gospel of “radical love.” Now, the love is gone.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The New Jersey senator’s attacks on Mr. Biden over criminal justice reform emerged as one of the tensest exchanges of the night as the two men battled over Mr. Biden’s role in the 1994 crime bill, which experts have linked to mass incarceration. “You are trying to shift the view from what you created,” Mr. Booker said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">A skilled orator comfortable with the kind of spontaneous sparring that defines presidential debates, Mr. Booker has been seeking a breakout moment to boost his campaign in the polls. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">After watching Ms. Harris attack Mr. Biden in the first debate and gain traction, he adopted a similar approach. Mr. Booker has built a campaign prepared to capitalize on a big moment. The question now is whether his best-in-class debate performance translates into the kind of fund-raising cash he’ll need to survive the fall campaign.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ms. Gillibrand began her bid for president in January with $10 million-plus in the bank and a belief that she would be a candidate to be reckoned with. But as of late July, the red warning lights are flashing. She faces the very real chance that this debate could be her last.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The good news: She landed one of the debate’s most memorable lines. “The first thing that I’m going to do when I’m president,” she said, “is I’m going to Clorox the Oval Office.” Twitter reported it was one of the top three most talked about moments of the night — and the only one not involving a dispute between two candidates. (It even got <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1156743998847033344?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">a response</a> from Mr. Trump’s campaign manager.)</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The not-so-good news: Her set piece portraying Mr. Biden as against women working outside the home in the early 1980s not only leaked in advance, dampening its impact, but failed to deliver in the moment. She kept reading back to Mr. Biden an old quote that women who work outside the home cause “deterioration of family.” But Mr. Biden sidestepped, saying he didn’t “believe” the line now, and questioned why this was coming up now after she had proudly appeared with him in the past.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I don’t know what happened,” he said, “except you’re running for president.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">She ended the debate with a closing plea for the donations she needs “so I can make the next debate stage.” She only has a few weeks to get them.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Andrew Yang and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington were a study in contrasts Wednesday. Two single-issue candidates — one who stuck to his issue throughout the debate, and one who did not.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Yang brought nearly every one of his answers back to his signature issue: a $1,000 monthly stipend called the universal basic income, and a warning about increasing automation dooming millions of American jobs.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But Mr. Inslee, who has built his campaign around protecting the environment, mentioned climate only when asked by the moderators, skipping on opportunities to inject what he calls the most important issue of the times into discussions about related topics.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The contrast between the two second-tier candidates shows why Mr. Yang has cleared the donor threshold to qualify for the party’s September and October debates and Mr. Inslee remains far behind the fund-raising pace to do so.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Yang likely will have more opportunities to talk about his campaign on national debate stages, while Mr. Inslee may not.</p>
