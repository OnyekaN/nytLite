Oh, and soccer superstars. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Lower Manhattan turned into quite the party on Wednesday as thousands of fans lined up along Broadway to cheer the United States women’s national team and its World Cup title at a <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/sports/soccer/soccer-parade.html?module=inline" title="">ticker-tape parade.</a></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Joining the flag-waving soccer stars as they rode along the Canyon of Heroes were Mayor de Blasio and the first lady, Chirlane McCray; Governor Cuomo; the TV broadcaster Robin Roberts; and the president of U.S. Soccer, Carlos Cordeiro.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It wasn’t just celebration, though. The players, led by Megan Rapinoe, have used their winning platform to support several causes, and they were true to form yesterday. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">One player had a sign that read “Parades are cool, equal play is cooler.” And afterward, at City Hall, <!-- -->Rapinoe<!-- --> delivered a memorable speech, highlighted by messages of both politics and pride — in her teammates and New York.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This group is so resilient, is so tough, has such a sense of humor,” Rapinoe said. “There’s nothing that can faze this group.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If you didn’t get a chance to join in the funfetti, check out <!-- -->more photos from the parade<!-- -->:</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thousands of fans and well-wishers filled the parade route, some hours early, to cheer and usher the champs along the Canyon of Heroes, a stretch of Broadway from Battery Park to City Hall. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rapinoe, in red sunglasses, waved to the crowd alongside Mr. de Blasio and Ms. McCray. During her speech at City Hall, Rapinoe paused from the partying to offer a serious challenge to Americans:</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“This is my charge to everyone: We have to be better, we have to love more and hate less. Listen more and talk less. It is our responsibility to make this world a better place.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Once the parade ended, Broadway was covered in confetti, ticker tape and stray parade paraphernalia.

Can we do another 100?”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Since putting out the word that new lifters were welcome, 80 additional volunteers have registered with feast organizers, Mr. Perrone said.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Can we as the younger generation of this feast pass this along?” he asked. “And that’s what we’re doing now.
