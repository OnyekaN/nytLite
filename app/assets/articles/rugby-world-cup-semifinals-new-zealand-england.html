<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">YOKOHAMA, Japan — The Rugby World Cup will hold its semifinals this weekend, and the cream has risen to the top. The four semifinalists' results in the pool stage and quarterfinals have them rightfully ranked Nos. 1 through 4 on the official World Rugby rankings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Of the major pretournament contenders, only Ireland, which had the misfortune of having to face New Zealand in the quarterfinals, has been eliminated. The Irish also were the first elite victim of the inspired host team from Japan, which eventually lost a physical quarterfinal against South Africa.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The semifinals each match a top team from the Southern Hemisphere against one of the best in Europe. On Saturday, New Zealand, the two-time defending champion, faces a powerful England team that is hitting on all cylinders. Wales will play South Africa on Sunday. Both games are at the Yokohama International Stadium.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">New Zealand holds a big edge over England all time (33-7-1) and in the current decade (7-1), but the teams have met only once in the past five years, a hard-fought 16-15 New Zealand victory in London last November.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In a news conference on Tuesday, England’s coach, Eddie Jones, called New Zealand “one of the greatest teams ever,” but added that the All Blacks’ pursuit of a World Cup three-peat has put added pressure on the team. He also said England had a better team now than the one that lost to<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span>New Zealand a year ago.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Steve Hansen has run good World Cup campaigns before, the best campaign,” Jones said, referring to the New Zealand coach. “We know they’ll be well prepared, but certainly we just have to look at how our team has developed since then. We’re a much more rounded and aggressive team than we were then.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"> “We’ve got nothing to lose, that’s the exciting thing for us,” Jones said. “We can just go out there and play our game.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Thirteen members of the current England squad played on the 2017 British and Irish Lions all-star team that went to New Zealand and drew a three-match series, 1-1-1.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They’re human,” Jones said. “They bleed, they drop balls, they miss tackles like every other player. It’s our job to take the time and space away so that we put them under pressure.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">England and New Zealand had relatively easy wins against well-regarded opposition in the quarterfinals, with the English defeating Australia, 40-16, and the All Blacks demolishing Ireland, 46-14.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The other quarterfinals were tougher. South Africa led Japan by only 5-3 at halftime. The Japanese had a huge edge in possession and territory but failed to capitalize thanks to South Africa’s relentless defense in its half. The Springboks turned things up in the second half to come away with a 26-3 victory.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Wales had an even more difficult time. France led by 19-10 nine minutes into the second half and was 10 yards from the Welsh try line when Sebastien Vahaamahina,<!-- --> <!-- -->the scorer of France’s first try, was ejected for elbowing Aaron Wainwright<!-- --> <!-- -->in the head, forcing the French to play the rest of the game a man short. It proved to be the turning point of the match, and Wales came back to win, 20-19.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That event led to an embarrassing postgame incident in which the South African referee, Jaco Peyper,<!-- --> <!-- -->was photographed with a group of Welsh fans and appeared to mock the elbowing incident by posing with his elbow raised into the chin of one of the Welsh fans. Peyper has apologized and admitted the photograph was inappropriate. World Rugby is investigating the incident, and Peyper will not referee any of the semifinal or final matches.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The head-to-head between South Africa and Wales is skewed heavily in South Africa’s favor, with the Springboks holding a 28-6-1 edge. But the Welsh have won five of the last six meetings.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Faf de Klerk,<!-- --> <!-- -->the South Africa scrumhalf<!-- --> <!-- -->who was player of the match against Japan, conceded that Wales may have a statistical edge.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“But we probably have our best team and best structure we’ve had in a few years,” he said. “Looking back at 2016, when I last played them, we had a completely different way of playing and attacking.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The last time South Africa did beat Wales was four years ago in London, in a World Cup quarterfinal.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Ken Owens, the Wales hooker, said he was not thinking much about the recent head-to-head record.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“They’ve definitely improved over the last two or three years,” Owens said. “They’ve got a pretty settled squad. Fortunately, we’ve won the last four against them, but form goes out of the window and records are there to be broken and all the rest of it.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Owens seemed more concerned about the size and power of the South African forward pack. “Hugely physical” is how he described the Springboks. “Everyone has spoken about that being bred in them. They’re a quality outfit. You can see the growth in their squad over the past couple of seasons under Rassie Erasmus.<!-- --> <!-- -->They’re a very well-coached team.”</p>
