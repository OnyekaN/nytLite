Or that the country is bitterly divided over Mr. Trump’s leadership. Or even that his party might well lose the House to an opposition hellbent on his downfall.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The dilemma — which he does not fully grasp — is that many of the senior officials in his own administration are working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">I would know. I am one of them.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">To be clear, ours is not the popular “resistance” of the left. We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But we believe our first duty is to this country, and the president continues to act in a manner that is detrimental to the health of our republic.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">That is why many Trump appointees have <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/04/us/politics/woodward-trump-book-fear.html?module=inline" title="">vowed to do what we can</a> to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The root of the problem is the president’s amorality. Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Although he was elected as a Republican, the president shows little affinity for ideals long espoused by conservatives: free minds, free markets and free people. At best, he has invoked these ideals in scripted settings. At worst, he has attacked them outright.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">In addition to his mass-marketing of the notion that the press is the “enemy of the people,” President Trump’s impulses are generally anti-trade and anti-democratic.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Don’t get me wrong. There are bright spots that the near-ceaseless negative coverage of the administration fails to capture: effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">But these successes have come despite — not because of — the president’s leadership style, which is impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">From the White House to executive branch departments and agencies, senior officials will privately admit their daily disbelief at the commander in chief’s comments and actions. Most are working to insulate their operations from his whims.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Meetings with him veer off topic and off the rails, he engages in repetitive rants, and his impulsiveness results in half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions that have to be walked back.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“There is literally no telling whether he might change his mind from one minute to the next,” a top official complained to me recently, exasperated by an Oval Office meeting at which the president flip-flopped on a major policy decision he’d made only a week earlier.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The erratic behavior would be more concerning if it weren’t for unsung heroes in and around the White House. Some of his aides have been cast as villains by the media. But in private, they have gone to great lengths to keep bad decisions contained to the West Wing, though they are clearly not always successful.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">It may be cold comfort in this chaotic era, but Americans should know that there are adults in the room. We fully recognize what is happening. And we are trying to do what’s right even when Donald Trump won’t.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The result is a two-track presidency.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Take foreign policy: In public and in private, President Trump shows a preference for autocrats and dictators, such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, and displays little genuine appreciation for the ties that bind us to allied, like-minded nations.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Astute observers have noted, though, that the rest of the administration is operating on another track, one where countries like Russia are called out for meddling and punished accordingly, and where allies around the world are engaged as peers rather than ridiculed as rivals.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">On Russia, for instance, the president was reluctant <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/world/europe/trump-russia-diplomats-expulsion.html?module=inline" title="">to expel</a> so many of Mr. Putin’s spies as punishment for the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. He complained for weeks about senior staff members letting him get boxed into further confrontation with Russia, and he expressed frustration that the United States continued to impose sanctions on the country for its malign behavior. But his national security team knew better — such actions had to be taken, to hold Moscow accountable.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">This isn’t the work of the so-called deep state. It’s the work of the steady state.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president. But no one wanted to precipitate a constitutional crisis. So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until — one way or another — it’s over.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The bigger concern is not what Mr. Trump has done to the presidency but rather what we as a nation have allowed him to do to us. We have sunk low with him and allowed our discourse to be stripped of civility.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Senator John McCain put it best in his <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/us/politics/john-mccain-farewell-statement.html?module=inline" title="">farewell letter</a>. All Americans should heed his words and break free of the tribalism trap, with the high aim of uniting through our shared values and love of this great nation.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">We may no longer have Senator McCain. But we will always have his example — a lodestar for restoring honor to public life and our national dialogue. Mr. Trump may fear such honorable men, but we should revere them.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">There is a quiet resistance within the administration of people choosing to put country first. But the real difference will be made by everyday citizens rising above politics, reaching across the aisle and resolving to shed the labels in favor of a single one: Americans.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0">The writer is a senior official in the Trump administration.</p><p class="css-jwz2nf etfikam0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Follow The New York Times Opinion section on </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.facebook.com/nytopinion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Facebook</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> and </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="http://twitter.com/NYTOpinion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">Twitter (@NYTopinion)</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">.</em></p>
