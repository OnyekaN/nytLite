<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If it came down to it, the guy from Portrush was prepared to take his quest to what he called the last chance saloon.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Buried amid the list of hopefuls signed up for the British Open final qualifying — a 36-hole Tuesday at St. Annes Old Links in England — briefly appeared the name of Graeme McDowell.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I was starting to make those plans a little bit — really, am I really doing this?” McDowell, the former United States Open winner, recalled last month. “O.K., I guess we are.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Of all the years to lose an automatic slot in the British Open, the timing could not have been worse. With golf’s oldest major championship returning to McDowell’s Northern Ireland hometown for the first time in 68 years, he was clawing to get in.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Fortunately for McDowell, it never came down to his last chance, which would have been the Scottish Open if St. Annes had not worked out. He found an entry via Canada, grabbing one of three berths through the RBC Canadian Open by making a 30-foot par putt on the final hole in June.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Pressure removed.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It would have been incredibly bittersweet not to have been at the Open Championship,” said McDowell, 39, who learned the game at Royal Portrush along with the neighboring Rathmore Golf Club. His closing 68 that day was good for a share of eighth.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rory McIlroy, the Canadian Open champion after shooting a 61 on the final day, was happy for his countryman’s accomplishment.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“It would’ve been such a shame if the Open comes to Portrush and the hometown boy couldn’t play,” McIlroy said. “I know it’s something he’s wanted for a while. Obviously, it’ll be great to have him in the field at Portrush.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0"><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">[Read more on how the </em><a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/sports/golf/british-open-royal-portrush.html?module=inline" title=""><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0">British Open finally returned to Royal Portrush</em></a><em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"> after almost 70 years.]</em></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">For nearly a decade, McIlroy, McDowell and Darren Clarke had been pushing to bring the Open back to their homeland. Royal Portrush had been host for the 1951 edition, but the tournament had not returned.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Their efforts were rewarded four years ago when it was announced that the 2019 Open would be played at Royal Portrush. But as the date approached, McDowell still had not qualified.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Clarke and McIlroy have guaranteed berths until age 60 as past Open champions; Clarke won in 2011 and McIlroy in 2014. And for years, McDowell’s world ranking was good enough to earn an automatic place in the lineup.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">McDowell reached as high as sixth at the end of 2010, when he won the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach and had three other victories.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He won five more times through 2014, nearly adding a second U.S. Open crown in 2012 and tying for fifth at the British Open a month later. He stayed entrenched among the top 25 into 2015. Even then, he won the OHL Classic in Mexico late that year.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Changes off the course were beginning to have an impact. McDowell built a home in Florida and married Kristin Stape in 2013. Children followed, and he entered the restaurant business.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">He fell out of the top 100 in 2017 and finished last year at 238.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“Golf is a fickle game,” McDowell said. “I took my eye off the ball — it felt like for a second — and a hundred 25-year-old kids came running by me.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Starting this season, McDowell’s PGA Tour status was even in question. After finishing outside the top 150 in last year’s FedExCup standings, his entry status fell.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I’ve had to ask myself some pretty hard questions the last couple of years,” McDowell said. “Thankfully, I’ve come to the conclusion that if it was all gone, I would miss it. So you know what, let’s try to enjoy it while it’s here. It’s an opportunity.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Opportunity came at the Corales Puntacana Resort &amp; Club Championship, a secondary event for those not eligible for a World Golf Championships stop the same week. Back-to-back 64s gave McDowell the lead heading to the final day, and he won by a shot.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The victory restored McDowell to a full PGA Tour card, and he could then focus on getting to Royal Portrush.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I felt the story snowballing,” McDowell said. “I felt like every tournament that I went to, people were reminding me that I wasn’t in Portrush. ‘Hope to see you at Portrush,’ ‘Hope you get in.’ Yeah, I know. I hope I do, too.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The Canadian Open is part of the Open Qualifying Series, tournaments in which British Open berths are made available to top finishers not already qualified. Failing that, McDowell was headed to the qualifier at St. Annes.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">If that didn’t work, three more berths were dangling at the Scottish Open.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“I certainly didn’t want to be in Scotland, last chance saloon, going, ‘This is it,’” he said. “But that was a real possibility.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Rounds of 65 and 67 put McDowell in contention in Canada, though a third-round 70 slowed his momentum. Beginning the final day, four golfers ahead of McDowell or tied with him were also competing for the three slots for Royal Portrush.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Things were still not settled as he headed to the final hole, where he drove in the left rough and had to lay up. His third shot stopped just short of the fringe.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“The putt was not makable, no,” McDowell recalled. “It had 12 feet of break in it. It was a ridiculously tough putt to make. I just fancied it — saw it, liked the way it looked.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“And when I saw it go in, it was a huge relief.”</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">McDowell tied for 16th at the U.S. Open and then headed for Royal Portrush. Though he faces a battle against such rivals as McIlroy and the world No. 1 Brooks Koepka, he feels the confidence returning.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">“To have the Open ticket punched now,” he said, “gives me that little bit of breathing room to hopefully focus on my game and be competitive. I feel like I’m playing well.”</p>
