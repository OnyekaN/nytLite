<p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte will cut short a trip to Japan and return to the Philippines because of “unbearable pain” <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/world/asia/philippines-rodrigo-duterte.html?searchResultPosition=1&amp;module=inline" title="">from a motorcycle accident last week</a>, his spokesman said on Tuesday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Duterte, who flew to Japan on Monday to attend an <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/world/asia/japan-emperor-naruhito-royal-family.html?module=inline" title="">enthronement ceremony for Emperor Naruhito</a>, is expected to come home on Tuesday night instead of Wednesday as planned, said the spokesman, Salvador Panelo. He said the president was experiencing “unbearable pain in his spinal column near the pelvic bone as a consequence of his fall during his motorcycle ride.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Duterte, 74, will miss an imperial banquet, which his daughter, Sara Duterte-Carpio, will attend in his place, Mr. Panelo said. He said the president would consult his neurologist on Wednesday.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Duterte’s aides announced on Thursday that he had stumbled off his motorcycle after parking it, following a ride around his security staff’s compound. Mr. Panelo said the president had fallen while reaching for his shoe, and that he had sustained “light bruises and minor scratches.” </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Duterte appeared later Thursday at a business forum and dismissed the episode as minor. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The fall came amid recent concern about the health of the president, who has recently disclosed that he suffers from a variety of ailments. He said this month that he has <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/06/world/asia/duterte-disease-philippines.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article" title="">myasthenia gravis</a>, a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to skeletal muscle weakness, which he said ran in his family. </p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Mr. Duterte has also recently been <a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/world/asia/duterte-philippines-absence-health.html?module=inline" title="">out of the public eye</a> for days at a time, leading to speculation about his whereabouts and his health. After his motorcycle accident last week, the opposition Liberal Party called for full disclosure of his hospital records.</p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">The president’s medical issues have had little effect on his ability to stir controversy with<a class="css-1g7m0tk" href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/10/20/1961701/free-kill-order-espenido-draws-mixed-reactions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""> bloody rhetoric about his war on drugs</a>, during which thousands of people have been killed by police officers and vigilantes.<span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"> </span></p><p class="css-exrw3m evys1bk0">Last week, Mr. Duterte said he had told a police commander that he was “free to kill everybody” in Bacolod, a city he said was plagued by drug syndicates. A spokesman<strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"> </strong>later said that Mr. Duterte had only been using colorful language to make a point.</p>
